    "title": "Streamlined Quantification of Microglial Morphology in Mouse Brains Using 3D Immunofluorescence Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Microglial cells are crucial patrolling immune cells in the brain and pivotal contributors to neuroinflammation during pathogenic or degenerative stress. Microglia exhibit a heterogeneous \"dendrite-like\" dense morphology that is subject to change depending on inflammatory status. Understanding the association between microglial morphology, reactivity, and neuropathology is key to informing treatment design in diverse neurodegenerative conditions from inherited encephalopathies to traumatic brain injuries. However, existing protocols for microglial morphology analyses lack standardization and are too complex and time-consuming for widescale adoption. Here, we describe a customized pipeline to quantitatively assess intricate microglial architecture in three dimensions under various conditions. This user-friendly workflow, comprising standard immunofluorescence staining, built-in functions of standard microscopy image analysis software, and custom Python scripts for data analysis, allows the measurement of important morphological parameters such as soma and dendrite volumes and branching levels for users of all skill levels. Overall, this protocol aims to simplify the quantification of the continuum of microglial pathogenic morphologies in biological and pharmacological studies, toward standardization of microglial morphometrics and improved inter-study comparability. Key features • Comparison of 3D microglial architecture between physiological and pathological conditions. • Quantitative assessment of critical microglial morphological features, including soma volume, dendrite volume, branch level, and filament length. • Simplified, semi-automated data export and analysis through simple Python scripts.

    "methods": "Materials and reagents Biological materials 1. Mice with conditional Ndusf4 ablation in Gad2 -espressing neurons (Gad2 Cre/+ :Ndufs4 lox/lox or Gad2:Ndufs4cKO) were obtained as previously described [12,13]. Gad2 Cre/+ :Ndufs4 lox/+ healthy males, expressing Cre specifically in Gad2 -positive cells, were crossed with healthy females that have floxed Ndufs4 exon 2 (Gad2 +/+ , Ndufs4 lox/lox ), resulting in Gad2:Ndufs4cKO pups or sex/age-matched controls lacking Cre-expression (Gad2 +/+ ) or functional loxP pair on the target gene (Ndufs4 lox/+ ). A full description of the analyses and results pertaining to these samples is described in [13]. Reagents 1. Ketamine (UAB, catalog number: 579557) 2.

Anesthesia and perfusion Anesthetize (intraperitoneally) mice with anesthesia solution (see Recipes) and perfuse (transcardially) with 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.5). 2. Post-fixation Following perfusion, carefully remove brains, post-fix overnight in 4% PFA solution, and store at 4 °C. 3. Sectioning After post-fixation, wash brains in PBS and section them into 30 µm-thick sections using a vibratome (Leica). Sections at the level of the external globus pallidus are identified based on anatomical landmarks using a mouse brain atlas, within a window between -0.1 and -0.94 mm from bregma [14]. 4. Storage Store brain sections at -20 °C in anti-freezing solution (see Recipes). This cryoprotectant solution preserves tissue integrity until further processing for immunofluorescence. B. Immunofluorescence analysis On day 1, rinse free-floating slices three times in 0.1 M PBS. After 15 min incubation in permeabilization solution (see Recipes), block slices in blocking solution (see Recipes) for 1 h. After the blocking, incubate slices in antibody solution (see Recipes) for 24 h at 4 °C with the microglia/macrophage marker IBA1 (1:1,000). On day 2, rinse sections three times for 10 min in PBS and incubate for 45–60 min with an Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody (1:750). Rinse sections for 10 min twice in PBS and twice in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5) before mounting in DAPI-Fluoromount-G solution [16]. C. Image acquisition Capture images of IBA1 immunofluorescence with a LSM780 confocal microscope as described [15] using the Z-stack functionality over a span of ~20 μm with intervals of 0.8 μm. The chosen interval of 0.8 μm was selected to ensure no loss of information and to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction of microglial morphology. This resolution is critical for maintaining the integrity of fine cellular structures and for subsequent quantitative analyses in Imaris software. Imaging is performed with a 40× PlanApo oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4), achieving a resolution of 1,024 × 1,024 pixels. The pixel dimensions are 0.156 μm × 0.156 μm, with a voxel depth of 0.8 μm. Two channels are acquired during imaging: 405 nm for DAPI and 647 nm for Alexa Fluor 647 antibody. Optimize the gain, offset, and laser power to maximize signal-to-noise ratio while minimizing photobleaching. Under our experimental conditions for IBA1 acquisition, the channel detector gain was set to 720, the offset to -40, and the laser power to 6.5. However, it is important to note that these settings are specific to this experiment and do not represent a standardized protocol. The Z-stack function in LSM works as follows: Set First/Last Mode: Define the upper and lower limits to specify the Z-axis range used in 3D imaging. Note: Select the channel of interest and click “live” mode to preview the sample; then, set the start and end of the Z-stack with this mode. Z-stack capture: Once the limits have been settled, press “start experiment” to acquire the Z-stack. D. 3D reconstruction and image pre-processing The protocol outlined below is tailored for image analysis using the commercial Imaris software. For those new to the software, please refer to online video tutorials and webinars available at http://www.bitplane.com/learning and https://imaris.oxinst.com/homeschool . 1. Upload the image and display adjustment ( Video 1 ) a. Upload Z-stack serial images of the microglia in Imaris 9.6. The software will automatically generate 3D images. Note: Imaris can convert single images or a series from .lsm file format to the required .ims format b. Select the channel corresponding to the signal and adjust the background fluorescence using Channel Max Intensity to minimize background noise and ensure accurate quantification. Video 1.

Add a new filament by clicking on the leaf icon. b. Click on the blue arrow to proceed to the next page and select the channel of interest. c. Manually adjust the parameter “Largest Diameter” in the starting point section. Note: In the slice view (two-dimensional viewer), measure several soma distances to adjust the largest diameter accordingly. d. Correct any inaccuracies in the dendrite beginning points manually by placing the point at the center of the soma or removing it as needed. e. Click on the green double arrow to finish the rendering. f. Select the Edit tab and remove any filaments not suitable for further analysis using the Delete function Note: Remove all filaments located on the tissue edge of the Z-stack. For falsely fused filaments, separate them by selecting a specific point and using the delete function. If separation is not feasible, remove those filaments from the analysis. g. Click on the Results tab and select the specific values you want to analyze. Export the data for further analysis. Note: For the comparison of filaments based on treatment and genotype, dendrite branch level and dendrite volume have proven to be efficient and sensitive parameters. Figure 3.

[13]. Cannabidiol ameliorates mitochondrial disease via PPARγ activation in preclinical models. Nat Commun. In this research article, we used the protocol described here to analyze 3D microglial morphology ( Figure 8A ) in the external globus pallidus, a highly affected brain region in Leigh syndrome mouse models. We demonstrated that mice with conditional Ndusf4 ablation in Gad2 -espressing neurons exhibited morphometric remodeling of microglia resembling the activated phenotype. Specifically, microglial cells in mutant mice displayed a larger soma size ( Figure 8B ) and dendrite volume ( Figure 8C ) compared to control mice, along with fewer branch levels and fewer branches per level ( Figure 8D ). Total filament length was not altered ( Figure 8E ). Data represented in Figure 8 are extracted from Puighermanal et al. [13]. Figure 8.

    "title": "Mouse Model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Pulpitis.",
    "abstract": "Pulpitis is an important and prevalent disease within the oral cavity. Thus, animal models are necessary tools for basic research focused on pulpitis. Researchers worldwide often use dogs and miniature pigs to construct animal models of pulpitis. However, gene editing in miniature pigs is difficult, the surgical modeling process is complex, and tooth demineralization time is lengthy. Although some researchers have attempted to establish a mouse model of pulpitis, most models have involved direct exposure of dental pulp. However, the causes of pulpitis vary considerably among individuals, hindering effective research. In this study, we established a mouse model of pulpitis by accessing the pulp cavity, exposing the pulp to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and then filling the tooth. One day after surgery, we observed many necrotic tissues and extensive inflammatory exudate, including neutrophils, around the coronal cavity preparation. Additionally, we noted many more neutrophils and a small amount of chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates at the junction between inflamed and normal tissue. These findings indicated that our model can be used to explore the early stage of pulpitis. Ten days after surgery, we observed vacuolar degeneration in some fibroblasts and proliferation in others at the distal end of the inflamed tissue. We also noted dilation and congestion of the pulp blood vessels. Therefore, our model can also be used to explore the middle and later stages of pulpitis. Thirty days after surgery, we observed necrosis in the coronal pulp cavity and upper half of the root pulp, indicating that our model can also be used to explore the end stage of pulpitis. This model is easy to establish, shows pulpitis progression in the dental pulp, exhibits a clear inflammatory phenotype, and can be readily combined with gene editing techniques. Accordingly, it is suitable for basic research focused on pulpitis and has substantial practical value. Key features • Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce pulpitis in mice. • The mouse model of LPS-induced pulpitis can be used in basic studies of pulpitis. • After 1 day, the mouse model of LPS-induced pulpitis can demonstrate the main phenotypes of early-stage pulpitis. • After 10 days, the mouse model of LPS-induced pulpitis can display the main phenotypes of middle and late stage pulpitis.

Autoclaving of the modeling instruments: Within 1–5 days before modeling, place the modeling instruments in a stainless-steel lunch box and sterilize them using an autoclave. Modeling surgery Anesthesia Weigh the C57BL/6 mouse using a beaker and an electronic scale with 0.1 g accuracy. Use 1.2% tribromoethanol (see Recipes) for anesthesia (intraperitoneal injection), with a dosage of 0.5 mL per 20 g body weight ( Figure 1A , B). Fixing Pinch the mouse’s toe to check its reaction. If the mouse does not respond when its toe is pinched, the mouse has reached a deep level of anesthesia. Then, secure the mouse to the surgical pad with medical adhesive tape; this will ensure that the mouse cannot interrupt the surgery ( Figure 1C ). Opening the pulp chamber Open the mouse’s oral cavity with curved ophthalmic forceps. Use dressing forceps to expand the oral cavity and protect the tongue, thus preventing injury by the diamond bur; concurrently, completely expose the upper portion of the mouth. Use the diamond bur to access the maxillary first molar in the mouse, then expand the pulp exposure with the dental file; the final diameter of exposure should be approximately 1 mm. From the exposure, white and slightly red dental pulp tissue should be visible ( Figure 1D ). Rinsing Aspirate 0.1 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution (see Recipes) with a 1 mL injection syringe. Place the tip of the needle over the medullary foramen and quickly empty the syringe to flush out any dentin debris that may have entered the medullary foramen. LPS induction Extract 10 μL of 1 mg/mL LPS-Pg (see Recipes) into a 0.1 mL centrifuge tube. Use straight ophthalmic forceps to completely saturate a small cotton ball in the LPS-Pg solution. Keep the saturated small cotton ball on the exposed pulp for 5 min. Pulp capping and tooth filling Remove the cotton ball and restore the tooth with Esthet-X flow ( Figure 1E ). After surgery, loosen the mouse’s restraints; return the mouse to the cage after it has awakened. Real surgical images can be found in Figure S1. Tissue decalcification and paraffin embedding ( Figure 2C ) Sample collection After day 1 and 10 of model establishment, sacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation; carefully harvest maxillary tissue with straight ophthalmic forceps tweezers and ophthalmic scissors. Place the maxillary tissues into a 15 mL centrifuge tube with 10% paraformaldehyde fixative (neutral) and incubate at room temperature for 24 h. Decalcification Place printed labels and tissues in sequential order in an embedding frame. Then, place them in a basin, fill it with fresh decalcification solution, seal the container, and store all components in a constant temperature shaker at 25 °C with a speed of 110 RPM. This process results in decalcification. The decalcification solution should be replaced every 2–3 days. The degree of decalcification should be observed by pricking the tissue with a needle every 2 days. If the needle can be moved in the tissue, cut a plane with a Lycra blade along the edge of the maxillary tissue to remove excess tissue and ensure that the embedding surface is flat, which can accelerate the softening speed. Figure 2. Operation process of tissue decalcification and paraffin embedding, HE staining, immunofluorescent staining, and immunofluorescent staining Dehydration and wax infiltration Remove the softened tissue from the decalcification solution, rinse with tap water for 5 h, place it into a dehydrating basket, and dehydrate using an alcohol gradient in the dehydrator. Prepare reagents for dehydration and wax infiltration: alcohol (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%), anhydrous ethanol (divide the liquid into three separate bottles labeled I, II, and III), benzyl alcohol, xylene (divide the liquid into two separate bottles labeled I and II), and melted paraffin (divide the liquid into three separate bottles labeled I, II, and III). The dehydration and wax infiltration steps are as follows: 75% alcohol for 2 h, 85% alcohol for 2 h, 90% alcohol for 1.5 h, 95% alcohol for 2 h, anhydrous ethanol I for 2 h, anhydrous ethanol II for 2 h, benzyl alcohol for 40 min, xylene I for 40 min, xylene II for 40 min, melted paraffin I for 0.5 h at 65 °C, melted paraffin II for 1 h at 65 °C, and melted paraffin III for 2 h 45 min at 65 °C. Embedding Transfer the wax-infiltrated tissue to the embedding machine. First, place the melted wax into the embedding frame. Then, place the tissue into the embedding frame according to the requirements of the embedding surface, and attach appropriate labels before the wax solidifies. Cool the wax on a -20 °C freezing platform. After solidification, remove the wax block from the embedding frame and trim it. Sectioning Use the trimmed wax block to prepare 4 μm thick paraffin sections. Float sections in warm water at 40 °C to flatten the tissue. Collect the sections and bake them in an oven at 60 °C. After the water has evaporated and the wax has melted, store the sections at room temperature. HE staining ( Figure 2D ) Dewaxing and rehydration Prepare reagents: environmentally friendly dewaxing and clearing solution (divide the liquid into two separate bottles labeled I and II), anhydrous ethanol (divide the liquid into two separate bottles labeled I and II), and 75% ethyl alcohol. Immerse paraffin sections in the following sequence: environmentally friendly dewaxing and clearing solution I for 20 min, environmentally friendly dewaxing and clearing solution II for 20 min, anhydrous ethanol I for 5 min, anhydrous ethanol II for 5 min, and 75% ethyl alcohol for 5 min. Subsequently, rinse with tap water. Hematoxylin staining Stain the sections with hematoxylin solution for 3–5 min and rinse with tap water. Next, immerse the sections in hematoxylin differentiation solution and rinse with tap water. Finally, immerse the sections in hematoxylin bluing solution and rinse with tap water. Eosin staining Immerse sections in the following sequence of solutions: 85% ethanol for 5 min, 95% ethanol for 5 min, and eosin dye for 5 min. Dehydration and sealing Prepare reagents for dehydration and wax infiltration: absolute ethanol (divide the liquid into three separate bottles labeled I, II, and III) and xylene (divide the liquid into two separate bottles labeled I and II). Immerse sections in the following sequence of solutions: absolute ethanol I for 5 min, absolute ethanol II for 5 min, absolute ethanol III for 5 min, xylene for 5 min, and xylene for 5 min. Then, seal the sections with neutral gum. Immunofluorescence staining ( Figure 2E ) Dewaxing and rehydration Prepare reagents: environmentally friendly dewaxing and clearing solution (divide the liquid into three separate bottles labeled I, II, and III) and anhydrous ethanol (divide the liquid into three separate bottles labeled I, II, and III). Sequentially immerse the sections in the following sequence: environmentally friendly dewaxing and clearing solution I for 10 min, environmentally friendly dewaxing and clearing solution II for 10 min, environmentally friendly dewaxing and clearing solution III for 10 min, absolute ethanol I for 5 min, absolute ethanol II for 5 min, and absolute ethanol III for 5 min. Subsequently, rinse with tap water. Antigen retrieval Place the sections in a water bath for 30 min. After retrieval is complete, allow sections to cool naturally. Wash the sections three times in PBS (pH 7.4) on a decolorization shaker for 5 min per wash. Serum blocking Dry the sections and use a hydrophobic pen to draw a circle around the tissue. Apply 3% BSA for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. Primary antibody incubation Prepare primary antibody: dilute the primary antibodies (DSPP 1:100; MPO 1:500) in PBS buffer. Add the diluted primary antibody to the sections, ensuring that they are lying flat in a humidified chamber. Incubate overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody incubation Wash the sections three times in PBS (pH 7.4) on a decolorization shaker for 5 min per wash. Add the secondary antibody (Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG) and incubate for 50 min at room temperature in the dark. Stain cell nuclei with DAPI Wash the sections three times in PBS (pH 7.4) on a decolorization shaker for 5 min per wash. Add the DAPI staining reagent and incubate for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Quench tissue autofluorescence and sealing Wash the sections three times in PBS (pH 7.4) on a decolorization shaker for 5 min per wash. Add tissue autofluorescence quenching agent B and incubate for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Use antifade mounting medium to seal the sections. Goldner trichrome staining ( Figure 2F ) Dewaxing and rehydration Prepare reagents: Xylene (divide the liquid into two separate bottles labeled I and II), anhydrous ethanol (divide the liquid into two separate bottles labeled I and II), and 75% ethyl alcohol. Sequentially immerse the paraffin sections in the following sequence: xylene I for 20 min, xylene II for 20 min, anhydrous ethanol I for 5 min, anhydrous ethanol II for 5 min, and 75% ethyl alcohol for 5 min. Subsequently, rinse with tap water. Nuclear staining Mix Goldner staining solution A and Goldner staining solution B in equal proportions. Place sections in the mixed solution and stain for 20 min. Wash with tap water, then differentiate with 1% hydrochloric acid alcohol solution for 2 s. Rinse with tap water, then wash with distilled water. Staining with Goldner staining solution C Immerse sections in the first jar of Goldner staining solution C for 10 min, then quickly rinse with 0.2% glacial acetic acid (3 s per rinse). Staining with Goldner staining solution D Immerse sections in Goldner staining solution D for 3 min. Monitor the staining under a microscope; ensure that Goldner staining solution C fades from the collagen areas. Staining with Goldner staining solution C Immerse sections in the second jar of Goldner staining solution C for 5 min, then quickly rinse with 0.2% glacial acetic acid (3 s per rinse). Staining with Goldner staining solution E Immerse sections in Goldner staining solution E for 5 min. Then, differentiate the stain using three jars of 0.2% glacial acetic acid (2 s per jar). Dehydrate the sections using three jars of anhydrous ethanol (2 s, 3 s, and 5 s, respectively). Clearing and sealing Place sections in the third jar of anhydrous ethanol for 5 min. Clear the sections in xylene for 5 min. Finally, seal with neutral gum. Perform microscopy examination, image acquisition, and analysis ( Figure 1F ) HE staining: Nuclei will be stained blue, whereas cytoplasm will be stained red. Immunofluorescence staining: DAPI (excitation wavelength 330–380 nm, emission wavelength 420 nm) will stain nuclei blue, whereas Cy3 (excitation wavelength 510–560 nm, mission wavelength 590 nm) will stain the target protein red. Goldner trichrome staining: mineralized bone will be stained green, whereas non-mineralized tissue will be stained orange red.\n\nValidation of protocol All four mice had induced pulpitis by LPS ( Figure 3 , 4 , and 5), which sufficiently validated this protocol.",

    "title": "Intravital Imaging of Intestinal Intraepithelial Lymphocytes.",
    "abstract": "Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are a numerous population of T cells located within the epithelium of the small and large intestines, being more numerous in the small intestine (SI). They surveil this tissue by interacting with epithelial cells. Intravital microscopy is an important tool for visualizing the patrolling activity of IEL in the SI of live mice. Most IEL express CD8α; therefore, here we describe an established protocol of intravital imaging that tracks lymphocytes labeled with a CD8α-specific monoclonal antibody in the SI epithelium of live mice. We also describe data acquisition and quantification of the movement metrics, including mean speed, track length, displacement length, and paths for each CD8α+ IEL using the available software. The intravital imaging technique for measuring IEL movement will provide a better understanding of the role of IEL in homeostasis and protection from injury or infection in vivo.",

We used Hvem flox-neo/flox-neo and Hvem fl/fl mice ( Seo et al., 2018 )\n\nProcedure Mouse preparation Please consult your Institutional Animal Care Committee or equivalent body to ensure that all procedures were reviewed and approved according to the governing laws. All procedures described here were approved by the La Jolla Institute for Immunology Animal Care and Use Committee. The guiding principle is to induce the least amount of stress on the animal. Handle animal cages with care so as not to startle the inhabitants. Avoid any strong scents, perfumes, and deodorants ( Mouse Room Conditions , n.d.). Practice handling of the mice to be confident, accurate, and gentle—this will minimize the stress to both animals and researchers. From the perspective of the mouse, repeated attempts to grab it are likely worse than a single successful capture. It is crucial to practice restraining the animal to deliver RO injections properly. In intravital microscopy, your biggest responsibility is to care for animals and to minimize the potential harm coming from your interventions. You will have a chance to glimpse the fascinating world of cellular behavior in their natural environment, but beware of false conclusions steaming from stressed, injured, damaged, hypoxic, unperfused, and photodamaged tissues. For antibody-based cell labeling, inject the antibodies 4 h before imaging to allow for sufficient time for antibody penetration. With shorter incubations, a significant fraction of the antibody remains in the blood vessels. Over time, surface-bound antibodies will be internalized, and distinct membrane staining will be replaced by a more uniform labeling in the cytosol ( Figure 1 ). In our hands, longer incubation times do not significantly improve cell labeling but are a cause of concern for biological actions mediated by antigen-antibody binding and other effects. Figure 1. Effect of varying antibody penetration times. Seven hours after RO injection of CD8α antibody (left), intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) show a classic membrane staining pattern. In contrast, 31 h after injection (right), IEL have internalized the CD8α antibody, leading to smaller, punctate signals. Scale bar = 100 μm. Brightness of each image was adjusted independently, and a green lookup table was used to improve visibility of the features. If you are only using one antibody, we recommend choosing a far-red fluorophore (e.g., Alexa Fluor 647) due to that channel’s lower autofluorescent background. For the two-channel imaging used here, we also used a green fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 488) to minimize channel bleed through. Use IgG antibodies directly conjugated to organic dyes, such as Alexa Fluor 488, 555, or 647. Avoid antibodies conjugated to bulky fluorescent proteins (such as phycoerythrin or allophycocyanin), as their large molecular weight impedes efficient diffusion into tissues and, while they are initially bright, they bleach quickly. Dilute 15–20 μg of antibody (here, anti-CD8α and/or anti-EpCAM antibody) in 50 μL of sterile PBS. Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane and inject the antibody solution retroorbitally ( Yardeni et al., 2011 ) It is important to inject the full volume of labeled antibody for consistent labeling without introducing any air bubbles in the mouse’s circulation. Return mice to cages for recovery. Mice need to be fasted for 4 h to slow down peristalsis. Suction ring setup Suction rings, originally developed for lung imaging ( Looney et al., 2011 ), offer a convenient way of stabilizing many mouse tissues. The rings we used were custom made at a CNC machine shop (see Notes for recommended supplier). An alternative design utilizes a resin 3D printer ( Ahl et al., 2019 ) and contains an embedded electrical heater to provide more physiological thermal conditions during imaging. Ahl et al. (2019) provides an elegant description of the complete vacuum system and includes the 3D stereolithography [files for the 3D printer (in .stl format)]. An alternative device, which uses clamping instead of vacuum pressure, is described in Koike et al. (2021). In this protocol, we based our part selection on United States American National Standard Pipe Thread (NPT). In this standard, fittings are based in inches. According to the standard, 3/8” barbed fitting will have a good fit for a 3/8” (9–10 mm) internal diameter vacuum tubing. The barb diameter is slightly larger than the tubing diameter to ensure a proper seal. You can modify the design to use materials available in your country or already existing in your laboratory. For the best performance of the vacuum system, you should try to maximize the internal diameter of the parts, minimize the total length of the circuit, and eliminate all leaks. Online suppliers such as Amazon, Fittings, Inc., or US Plastic Corporation offer a convenient source of parts. A local hardware or automotive stores can also serve as valuable resources for users who need additional help in procuring the parts or assembling the circuit. Assemble the vacuum system ( Figure 2 ). The suction ring is connected to a small vacuum trap to collect any biological fluids. From there, it is connected to a fine adjustment valve, a coarse adjustment valve, and a gauge to read the vacuum pressure. Finally, it is connected to the central building vacuum through a filter as a secondary method to prevent any contamination. Connect the pieces in the following order: Connect the hydrophobic filter disk to the central vacuum shutoff valve with the 3/8” thick-walled vacuum tubing. Attach the tubing to the barb of the 1/4” NPT female connector, and couple it to a male-male coarse adjustment valve using Teflon tape. Couple the NPT connector with the female Tee connector. Add the male-male extension nipple to the top of the Tee connector and fit the pressure gauge on top with the female-female 1/4” NPT coupling. Attach the 1/4” NPT male to 5/16” barb connector to the Tee connector and fit the 5/16” vacuum tubing. Add the plastic T-splitter and attach the 2-way stopcock fine adjustment valve on a length of tubing that will allow placement of the stopcock within reach of the surgeon. This valve can be opened to reduce the vacuum or closed to increase it. An alternative design can use an aquarium pump valve. Attach the small vacuum trap with 5/16” vacuum tubing and secure it upright. Add required length of the vacuum tubing to reach the microscope and connect the 1/4” barb to Luer lock connector. Add Teflon tape if needed to ensure proper seal. Figure 2. Schematics of vacuum circuit. A. Parts with female NPT connectors are indicated in orange; parts with male NPT connectors are indicated in blue. Grey parts are plastic luer-type or barbed connectors. B. Example build with vacuum gauge and adjacent parts. Remove the plunger from a 10 mL syringe and squeeze a large bead of the vacuum grease into the syringe. Insert the plunger and apply a thin line of grease on the edge of the ring. Use Dumont #5/45 forceps to distribute the grease evenly on the rim of the ring. Remove any grease that got into the groove of the ring. Clean a #1.5 12 mm diameter coverslip with 70% alcohol and wipe on lens paper to remove any traces of dust and lint. Place the coverslip on ring and press down to seal ( Figure 3A ). Place the suction ring assembly on a post raised above the microscope stage and secure it with a right-angle post clamp or swivel clamp. We use a custom-made aluminum block with the post attached, screwed into the microscope stage for maximum stability, which can be requested at a machine shop. Make sure the cover glass is perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope by aligning the ring parallel to the lens of the objective ( Figure 3B ). Figure 3. Assembling the suction ring. A. Attach a #1.5 coverslip to suction ring with vacuum grease and attach PE160 tubing. B. Adjust the ring to be parallel to the front lens of the objective. C. Position the suction ring and the nose cone on the heated platform. Connect the suction ring via 18 G blunted needle end to the Luer lock of the vacuum circuit. Set the system to 5–20 mbar vacuum pressure. The exact value is dependent on the preparation and the way in which the system is integrated. Use the lowest vacuum pressure sufficient to stabilize the tissue. Microscope setup Insert the objective onto the piezo Z controller. Open the acquisition software and initialize the resonant scanner. Turn on appropriate laser lines and initially set the power to a low setting (~5%). In our case, we imaged using the 488 and 638 nm lines. Select a dichroic filter that will give you the ability to switch between laser lines without needing to move any hardware. In our case, it was the 488/552/638 triple dichroic mirror for the SP8 system. For optimal use of confocal reflection microscopy for label-free detection of tissue structure, use the Reflection/Transmission mirror. Set up the internal detector wavelengths, assigning the fluorescence gathered from antibody labeling on your most sensitive detectors (in our case, HyD detectors). These wavelengths were selected for AF488, AF647, and the confocal reflection channel: AF488: 494–563 nm Reflection: 619–651 nm AF647: 651–722 nm Either the tissue reflection or EpCAM staining for epithelium can be used to identify SI anatomy, although they provide slightly different information ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4. Comparison of visible structures from tissue reflection (left) and EpCAM staining (right) at three depths through the small intestinal (SI) villi. Brightness is adjusted in each image individually to accent details. Scale bar = 100 μm. Blue dotted lines = location of basal lamina. Blue arrows = basal lamina visible by reflection microscopy. Orange arrows = autofluorescent debris or non-specific binding of EpCAM antibody to macrophages. Set the system to perform XYZT imaging, with the Z stepper controlled by the piezo element. Adjust the pinhole size to two Airy units, enable bidirectional scanning, and find the appropriate phase correction. Enable line averaging during live acquisition setting and set the data acquisition mode to 8-bit. Set the zoom to the minimum allowed by the system for biggest field of view and adjust the line averaging to at least 8×. Our pixel size was set to approximately 0.6 μm with a corresponding field of view of approximately 370 μm. Surgery and intravital microscopy Please ensure all mouse handling and surgery steps are written in your Animal Care Committee–approved protocol. The following procedure is rather complex, with the scientist needing to simultaneously pay attention to the mouse anesthesia, the vacuum window pressure, and the image acquisition. We highly recommend practicing each part of the procedure slowly before attempting the full intravital imaging workflow. For example, a novice user can test the labeling, vacuum window, and image acquisition by practicing with a mouse that has been euthanized 4 h after antibody injection. We found that preparations with isoflurane alone had too much movement ( Video 1 ). Ketamine/xylazine anesthesia followed by isoflurane inhalation creates the best conditions for imaging with reduced motion artifacts ( Figure 5 , Video 2 ). Prepare the ketamine/xylazine mixture in sterile PBS (10 mg/mL ketamine and 1.5 mg/mL xylazine). Weigh the mouse and deliver 10 μL of the prepared solution per gram of body weight (100 μg of ketamine and 15 μg of xylazine per gram of mouse weight) via intraperitoneal injection. Figure 5. Example images from a well stabilized (left) and poorly stabilized (right) intravital movie. The image on the left was taken using a mouse anesthetized with both ketamine/xylazine and isoflurane; the image on the right was from a mouse anesthetized only with isoflurane. These are Z projections of single time points. Yellow arrows point to cell shadows that are caused by significant tissue motion between sequential Z steps, compromising the accuracy of the analysis. Green = CD8α; White = EpCAM. See also supplementary movies. Brightness was adjusted in each image. Scale bar = 100 μm. Video 1. Representative movie from an insufficiently stabilized preparation (isoflurane-only) that cannot be accurately quantified. Maximum intensity Z projection of a 10 min time series. Green = CD8α; White = EpCAM. Scale bar = 74 μm. See also Figure 4 . Video 2. Representative example of a well stabilized movie from a mouse anesthetized with isoflurane and ketamine/xylazine. Maximum intensity Z projection of a 10 min time series. Green = CD8α; White = EpCAM. Scale bar = 74 μm. See also Figure 4 . After anesthesia onset, shave the abdominal area with clippers or with hair removal lotion, followed by cleaning with 70% isopropanol. Place the mouse ventral side up on heating pad and place the snout of the animal in isoflurane facemask. We place a thin steel plate over the ATC2000 heating pad, connected with thermal paste, to enable the use of a magnetic isoflurane mask. Alternatively, you can tape the isoflurane mask directly onto the heating pad. Turn on isoflurane flow to face mask. Observe the breathing pattern of the animal and maintain a stable plane of anesthesia by delivering between 0.5% and 2% isoflurane. Labored breathing indicates the animal has been anesthetized too deeply. Secure the limbs of the mouse with laboratory tape. Insert a Vaseline-coated rectal thermometer and secure it by taping it to the tail. Set the feedback loop of the animal temperature controller to 37 °C. Verify that a sufficient anesthesia level has been reached with a toe pinch ( Figure 6A ). Position the ring assembly above the center of the abdomen and adjust it such that it is parallel to the front lens of the objective ( Figures 3B and 6H ). You might need to reposition the mouse to ensure that the ring has unobstructed access to the area. It is much safer to reposition the intact animal before incisions. Move the ring out of the way for surgery. Make an approximately 2 cm midline incision in the skin with surgical scissors ( Figure 6B ). Locate the linea alba and make a 1.5 cm incision along it in the peritoneum to expose the small intestine, taking care to avoid inadvertently introducing hair in the surgical area or cutting through blood vessels ( Figure 6C ). Using two wetted cotton tipped applicators, delicately move the intestine and position the antimesenteric side upwards. Look for areas that are free of food matter. Take care not to accidentally twist the gut and pinch the blood supply. Locate the stomach and find the piece of intestine distal to it. This will be the distal duodenum or jejunum. Exteriorize a small loop through the opening in the peritoneum ( Figure 6D ). Notice the blood vessels on both sides of the intestine and avoid cutting or damaging them. Using a cautery set to medium power, gently cauterize the antimesenteric surface of the intestine ( Figure 6E ). With small scissors, make an approximately 1 cm long opening along the cauterized edge ( Figure 6F ). Use cotton tipped applicators to gently open and flatten the gut, revealing the mucosal surface of the villi ( Figure 6G ). You may also use forceps but grab only the edges of the tissue. Work quickly to avoid drying the tissue. If necessary, you can add a drop of PBS onto the mucosal surface to keep it moist. However, it is best not to disturb the mucus layer over the villi, because this will increase the amount of tissue movement. If you notice any bleeding, cauterize the wounded area immediately. If excess blood has pooled near the region of interest, add a drop of PBS and use gauze or a cotton tipped applicator to remove the excess. It is important to minimize blood loss because any blood on the imaged area will reduce the fluorescence intensity, but, as above, washing the tissue can damage the mucus and cause additional tissue motion. Hold the suction ring in your dominant hand and lower it onto the exposed mucosal surface. Control the waste vacuum valve with your other hand and adjust the pressure to the lowest possible setting that achieves a complete seal against the tissue. You should see that the tissue is flattened against the coverslip ( Figure 6H ). Because the required pressure depends on how well the intestine seals to the ring, it is less important to keep the measured pressure consistent than ensuring the tissue is stable and undamaged in each preparation. Figure 6. Overview of the surgical procedure. (A) Secure the animal and verify adequate anesthesia. (B) Make a midline incision taking care not to damage skin blood vessels (arrow). (C) Open peritoneum along linea alba and avoid major vessels. (D) Gently exteriorize the gut and find appropriate section free of food. (E) Cauterize the antimesenteric side. (F) Cut along the cauterized area to open the intestine. (G) Gently stretch and flatten mucosal surface. (H) Position suction ring above the exposed intestine and gently lower it onto the tissue while adjusting suction force to adhere the tissue to the coverslip. Add a drop of PBS on top of the coverslip for immersion and lower your objective to make contact with the fluid. With a long working distance objective, you will typically need to move the objective away from the ring to find the focus. Using the 25× (0.95) objective and a green fluorescence filter cube, look through the eyepiece and observe the preparation under epifluorescence illumination. Erythrocytes in capillaries of the villi should be traveling at a high speed; you might see an occasional bigger immune cell moving through the blood stream. If the tissue is moving, gradually increase the pressure with the fine adjustment. Alternatively, inspect other areas within the vacuum ring to find a more stable location. You can further increase the stability of the preparation by gently lifting the ring by a few millimeters to isolate the attached tissue from the mouse’s respiration (Move the objective out of the way before attempting this.). If you can see erythrocytes stopped in capillaries or moving in a backwards and forward motion, your vacuum pressure is too high, or you raised the preparation too much and the blood vessels have become pinched. Good preparations should show minimal movement of the villi and robust perfusion through the capillaries. Start image acquisition in live mode and adjust the gain and laser power as necessary to utilize the full dynamic range without saturation. Image in simultaneous mode after calibrating the detectors’ gains and wavelengths to avoid bleed through. Choosing optimal parameters for intravital imaging involves balancing the need for high acquisition speed to track moving cells, high sensitivity to detect dimly labeled cells, and large field-of-view to make the most of every labor-intensive experiment. For more details on acquisition setup for intravital imaging, please see the review ( McArdle et al., 2016 ). Set the top and bottom of Z stack to encompass the top of the villus, the subepithelial area, and lamina propria. The basal lamina can be seen by reflection microscopy ( Figure 4 , blue arrows). If you use EpCAM labeling, the transition between the epithelium and lamina propria is visible as a distinct change in tissue texture ( Figure 4 , blue dotted lines showing some examples). Autofluorescent or non-specifically labeled macrophages are characteristic cells in the lamina propria that serve as a useful landmark ( Figure 4 , orange arrows). Adjust the step size to 2.8 μm. Set the timelapse imaging to acquire Z stack every 30 s or faster, trimming the Z stack if needed. Acquire data for a minimum of 10 min per location. Save the data as .lif file. Monitor the mouse plane of anesthesia throughout the experiment by observing the breathing pattern every 5–10 min and adjusting the amount of vaporized isoflurane as needed. Do a pinch test between the acquisitions to verify if the animal is fully anesthetized. After completion of the imaging, euthanize the animal according to your approved protocol. Clean the ring with PBS and 70% alcohol and remove the coverslip and any remaining vacuum grease. Image processing The suction ring often provides enough stability to the tissue to proceed with analysis without further motion removal. However, if necessary, small motion artifacts can be minimized after acquisition in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 ). Whether the mechanical stabilization is sufficient for cell tracking is determined visually. Loosely, post-processing is necessary if there was gross tissue motion between Z steps or between sequential time steps of > 1/2 of a typical cell diameter ( Figure 5 ). Open the 1–3 channel .lif file in Fiji as a hyperstack using the Bioformats importer. Delete any Z steps that are entirely outside of the detectable tissue or region of interest because blank images without meaningful signal disrupt the alignment algorithm. Change the color of each channel to either red, green, or blue, and then flatten the multichannel image to an RGB image. (This step can be skipped if there is only one channel.) If each villus shows independent motion that ought to be corrected separately, create small crops of each villus. Each cropped region should be just large enough to capture the entire villus through all Z stacks and time points. Process all further steps independently for each region. Apply the MSTHyperStackReg2 plugin ( Ray et al., 2016 ). This software first aligns each Z step of each time point individually. Next, a maximum intensity Z projection is created to register the time series, and the calculated transform for each time step is applied to each Z position. At each stage, the entire sequence (either in Z or in T) is registered using minimum weighted spanning trees to choose a reference image and to ensure that outliers (images with particularly extreme motion artifacts) do not degrade the quality of the global alignment. This algorithm corrects lateral tissue movement in X and Y but does not correct vertical drift (Z motion). i. First, perform coarse registration. We recommend using rigid body alignment using the approximate with a large graph width (the larger of half the number of Z steps per stack or half the number of time points) and allowing it to automatically choose the anchor image and add a border ( Figure 7A ). The automatically produced maximum intensity image can be used to visually check the alignment. Save the aligned Z stack as an intermediate step. High quality images with small non-linear tissue distortions can be successfully corrected using affine transformations, though affine transforms often produce very bad results from noisy or sparse images. ii. Next, perform fine alignment on the results. We recommend using rigid body transforms, the exact method, a small (i.e., 5) graph width, automatic anchor selection, and no additional border ( Figure 7A ). This step can take a long time (hours), depending on the dimensions of your image and the graph width. iii. The improvement in image quality using image registration is illustrated in Video 3 by comparison to Video 2 . Video 3. Improvement in image quality using image registration. The 3D data from Supplementary Video 2 was processed with MISTICA image alignment, which minimized jitter and drift. Maximum intensity Z projection of a 10 min time series. Green = CD8α; White = EpCAM. Scale bar = 74 μm. In Fiji, adjust the image properties to set the voxel dimension and time step. Save the final result as a .tif hyperstack. Immune surveillance of the epithelium can be measured by calculating the area covered by all labeled cells during a set amount of time in Fiji. Load the raw .lif file or the aligned .tif hyperstack into Fiji. Use the reflection signal or the EpCAM channel to identify the epithelial layer. At the top of each finger-like villus, there is a region approximately 10 μm deep that is nearly exclusively epithelium. IEL often migrate along the basement membrane separating the SI epithelium from the lamina propria. Create a substack of the volume encompassing the epithelium at the top of the villus and the basement membrane and trim each video to a set amount of time (e.g., 10 min). Using the polygon tool, draw a region of interest (ROI) encircling each villus and save each region to the ROI manager ( Figure 7B ). Split the channels. On the CD8α channel, use a median filter (2D, radius 2 pixels) to remove pixel noise. Create a maximum intensity Z projection and then a maximum intensity T projection to combine all timepoints and Z locations into a single image, which has the location of every cell overlaid in the 10 min movie ( Figure 7B ). Using the threshold tool, determine the intensity threshold that separates cells from background non-specific signal ( Figure 7B ). Ideally, this can be determined by performing one preliminary experiment with a labeled isotype control antibody. In the absence of this negative control sample, set the threshold to be just under the intensity of the dimmest labeled IEL. Use the same threshold for all samples by pressing the Set button and typing the determined threshold. Apply the threshold to binarize the image. In Fiji, set the measurements to include area and area fraction; uncheck limit to threshold . Measure each ROI defining a villus. The results window will report the total area of the villus and the fraction that was visited by a cell in the time period ( Figure 7C ). The movement of the cells can be displayed with a rainbow time projection ( Figure 7D ). Use the maximum intensity Z projection time series from step 2e and apply the Fiji plugin Temporal-Color Code ( Miura, 2022 ) to show each time step as a unique color. Fast cells will appear as rainbow streaks while immobile cells appear white (all colors overlaid). Figure 7. Examples of image processing steps and results. A. Screenshots of MSTHyperStackReg plugin parameters for an image with 85 Z-steps and 40 timepoints. Left: First round (approximate) settings, with graph width half of the Z stack. Right: second, more precise round of alignment. B. Screenshots of intermediate results during the calculation of villi coverage by intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). Left: Each villus is outlined using the EpCAM channel. Middle: median smoothing is applied to the CD8α channel and a maximum intensity project over all Z steps and all time points is applied to overlay the position of every IEL. Right: a threshold is applied to find the area visited by an IEL at least once during the 10 min movie and the villi outlines are overlaid (yellow). C. In each villus, the percentage of the area visited by an IEL is calculated. D. Alternatively, IEL movement can be displayed as a rainbow time projection. E. CD8α-AF488 IEL (green) were tracked in Imaris. The tracks are shown as orange lines. EpCAM-AF647 (purple) marks the small intestinal (SI) epithelium. White arrows show a few of the many examples of artifacts that are visible in both the AF488 and AF647 channels. The yellow arrow shows a non-specifically labeled cell. F. Cell displacement, total movement distance, and speed were calculated from the Imaris tracks. G. The migration of each cell is shown as a spider plot. Scale bars = 100 μm. Movement statistics, such as mean speed, track length, and displacement demonstrate cell activation and patrolling behavior. Track the IEL in 3D in Imaris to quantify cell motility. In Imaris, open the raw .lif files or tifs aligned in Fiji. If you are working with processed tifs, it is a good idea to check the voxel size and time step information in Image Properties. If necessary, correct slow lateral and axial drift affecting the entire imaged volume in Imaris before cell tracking. i. Use the Spots function to track bright, stable features, such as immobile cells, or autofluorescent or reflective debris. Please see below (step 3c) for details on the Spots function. Choose 3–10 spots that span the entire volume under analysis for the entire time series. ii. In the Edit Tracks tab, select Correct Drift . Choose the options for correcting the image and objects, using translational and rotational drift, and include the entire result. Tracking the movement of IEL can be performed semi-automatically with the Spots wizard ( Figure 7E ). The exact parameters need to be optimized for each project, but the overall process is similar in all cases. Detect round objects in your chosen channel (CD8α) and then apply quality, size, and intensity filters to remove debris and macrophages that have picked up the antibody. The most sensitive parameter is usually the expected object diameter; be sure to choose the typical diameter of the fluorescent spot, which may be smaller than the cell diameter if the antibodies have been internalized or if the cells are polarized. Add object filters to remove debris that is bright in multiple channels. Imaris then performs tracking of the segmented objects over time. For well-stabilized movies, the autoregressive motion algorithm usually produces the best results, although the Brownian motion algorithm can work in some cases. At this stage, adding track filters to remove stationary objects can improve performance. There will nearly always be mistakes in the automatic tracking for intravital imaging data: single tracks inappropriately split, tracks jumping between neighboring cells, or non-IEL objects being included. Surface-labeled IEL can be distinguished from other objects by their shape (hollow, round), speed (greater than local tissue motion), and directionality (movement along basal lamina, as opposed to transverse). If multiple channels were imaged, autofluorescent objects can be seen in all channels, whereas antibody signals are usually much brighter in the proper channel ( Figure 7E ). Correct the centroid spots and connecting tracks manually in the Edit tab of the Spots object. It is important to use the same level of care and attention on all samples; manually correcting some images but not others can bias the final results. For further information on how to perform tracking in Imaris, please refer to Bitplane’s extensive online tutorial library. In the Statistics tab, export the track speed, track length, and track displacement metrics to a csv file. ( Figure 7F ). Use the export data for plotting to export the cell positions at each time point in a convenient three-column format. Spider graphs are an informative way to visualize cell migration. In these graphs, each cell starts at position (0, 0) and its total path is drawn in a random color, demonstrating overall cell motility and directionality. i. The spider plots can be generated from the exported cell position data using a simple script or stand-alone application found on GitHub ( github.com/saramcardle/IEL ) ( Figure 7G ). ii. Alternatively, a spider graph can be generated in Imaris. First, select all the IEL tracks and duplicate the spots. In the new spots object, select all of the tracks and then apply the Translate tracks function in the Tools tab. This will move all of the tracks to originate at the same location. The newly adjusted position of each cell can be exported to a spreadsheet for plotting. Limitations of image analysis The cell-by-cell statistics produced here inherently have high variance due to natural biological variability (see plots in Figure 7 ). Additionally, each experiment only yields a small number of tracked cells (~20–40). Therefore, it is only possible to detect large differences between groups. Even with tissue stabilization and drift correction, some tissue movement is usually still present. This tissue movement defines the lower limit of reliable quantification for cell speed and travel distance. To measure this for each dataset, track some autofluorescent spots that should not move during image acquisition, such as macrophages and food debris, using the Imaris spots wizard. Calculate their average speed and travel distance. The results show the sensitivity of your measurements; differences between cell groups smaller than typical gross tissue movement should be ignored, and preparations with unusually large tissue movement should be discarded. Sometimes, it can be difficult to distinguish antibody-labeled IEL from non-specific signals or autofluorescent objects. It is important to optimize the antibody concentration and injection time for your specific experimental protocol. Additionally, it can be helpful to perform a preliminary experiment using an isotype control antibody to visualize the intensity, location, and shape of artifacts as a negative control. Please plan your experiments to minimize batch effects. If comparing two (or more) groups of mice, always image a mouse from each group back-to-back using the same batch of antibodies. Alternate which group is chosen to be run first each day, so that there is no systemic bias in the length of antibody incubation time or fasting time. i. For projects comparing the activity of different cell populations, rather than different mouse conditions, it is possible to image two cell populations simultaneously with two different fluorophore-labeled antibodies. In this case, the movement characteristics of one population can be normalized to that of the other population in each mouse individually. This is an elegant way to minimize the differences in tissue motion in each preparation.",

    "title": "PEPITA: Parallelized High-Throughput Quantification of Ototoxicity and Otoprotection in Zebrafish Larvae.",
    "abstract": "Drug-induced hearing injury (ototoxicity) is a common, debilitating side effect of many antibiotic regimens that can be worsened by adverse drug interactions. Such adverse drug interactions are often not detected until after drugs are already on the market because of the difficulty of measuring all possible drug combinations. While in vivo mammalian assays to screen for ototoxic damage exist, they are currently time-consuming, costly, and limited in throughput, which limits their utility in assessing drug interaction outcomes. To facilitate more rapid quantification of ototoxicity and assessment of adverse drug interactions that impact ototoxicity, we have developed a high-throughput workflow we call parallelized evaluation of protection and injury for toxicity assessment (PEPITA). PEPITA uses zebrafish larvae to quantify ototoxic damage and protection. Previous work has shown that hair cells (HCs) in the zebrafish lateral line are very similar to human inner ear HCs, meaning zebrafish are a viable model to test drug-induced ototoxicity. In PEPITA, we expose zebrafish larvae to different combinations of drugs, fluorescently label the HCs, and subsequently use microscopy to quantify the brightness of the fluorescently labeled HCs as an assay for ototoxic damage and hair-cell viability. PEPITA is a reproducible, low-cost, technically accessible, and high-throughput assay. These advantages allow many experiments to be conducted in parallel, paving the way for systematic evaluation of drug-induced hearing injury and other multidrug interactions. Key features • Analysis of drug-induced hair cell damage associated with ototoxicity using Danio rerio • Ototoxicity assessment performed in vivo • Uses microscopy to generate images to assay ototoxicity quantitatively. • Enables testing of various combinations of drugs at various doses to determine toxicity-associated drug-drug interaction outcomes (synergy, antagonism).",

We used the Dremel Digilab 3D45 3-D printer. Set a hot plate to medium heat and let it heat up. While heating, cut rectangles of nylon mesh, approximately 9 cm × 12 cm. Fold a piece of aluminum foil over itself so that it forms a double-layer piece of foil that is slightly bigger than the nylon mesh pieces. Once at temperature, place the double layer of aluminum foil on the hot plate. Place a rectangle of nylon mesh on top of the aluminum foil. Immediately press the 3D-printed multi-well insert into the nylon mesh, applying enough pressure for the bottom of the insert to melt onto the nylon mesh ( Figure 1a , b). Apply pressure for 3 s, then quickly press around the edge of each well to form a complete seal between the bottom of the 3D-printed insert and the nylon mesh ( Figure 1c ). Immediately remove the foil-nylon-insert contraption from the hot plate. Figure 1. Procedure for adhering the nylon mesh to the 3D-printed multi-well plate insert. (A) Place the 3D-printed insert on top of nylon mesh and aluminum foil. (B) Firmly press the 3D-printed insert onto the mesh for 3 s. (C) Press around the perimeter of each well to form a complete seal around the base of the well with the nylon mesh. Once off the hot plate, immediately press the insert into the nylon mesh for 3 more seconds on the benchtop to further adhere the 3D-printed insert to the nylon mesh. Press around the edge of each well to further solidify the seal. Gently peel off the foil from the insert. Check to ensure the bottom of each well of the insert forms a complete seal with the nylon mesh. If necessary, repeat steps A6–8 several more times until this is achieved. Note: When repeating steps A6–8, it may only be necessary to selectively apply pressure to just the wells of the insert with incomplete seals. Once each well is completely sealed by nylon mesh, use small scissors to cut away the excess nylon mesh remaining between wells. Feel around the bottom of each well to ensure that the seal with the mesh has not been compromised during the trimming process. It may also be helpful to gently poke the bottom of the well with the eraser end of a pencil to ensure the seal is intact. If necessary, repeat steps A6–8 for the wells that need repair. Prepare a container of 10% bleach solution and completely submerge the completed multi-well inserts in the bleach solution for at least 20 min and no longer than 24 h. Prepare a container of distilled water. Transfer the multi-well inserts from the bleach solution to the distilled water and let soak for up to 24 h. After soaking, remove the multi-well inserts from the distilled water and let air dry. Store in a clean plastic bag until ready to use. Zebrafish embryo preparation Day –1: Set up crosses (day before fertilization) Select healthy zebrafish from a stock population and place into breeding tanks—females on one side of each tank and males on the other. Day 0: Water change, execute crossing, collect embryos (day of fertilization) When the tank room lights turn on, promptly refresh the water in the breeding tanks, remove the breeding dividers, and execute crossing. Observe fish until they start spawning, and clear, viable embryos are produced. When spawning is complete, prepare a bleach solution in a beaker: 100 μL of bleach, 150 mL of ICS water (do this before straining eggs). Bleaching the eggs helps to remove mites and other potential biological contaminants from the water. Recover all embryos from the tank by straining out embryos with a strainer. Rinse embryos into bleach solution using an ICS water squirt bottle. Add ICS water until the final volume of water is 170 mL. Leave embryos in the bleach solution for 10 min. Swirl eggs intermittently. After 10 min, strain the embryos in the bleach solution by pouring the bleach solution with embryos back through the strainer into the sink. Rinse embryos in the strainer thoroughly with ICS water. Partition embryos into Petri dishes. Aim for ~100 embryos per Petri dish (for enough dissolved oxygen and enough water to dilute nitrogenous waste being produced). Use as many Petri dishes as needed. Using a dissecting microscope, remove all unviable embryos (usually cloudy or malformed). Incubate overnight at 28.5 °C. Day 1: Sort embryos (1 day post-fertilization, dpf) Under a dissecting microscope, find all viable embryos and transfer them with a wide-bore Pasteur pipette into new Petri dishes with new ICS water. Aim for ~50 (no more than 60) embryos per Petri dish. Place Petri dishes in an incubator overnight at 28.5 °C. Day 3–4: Dechorionate (3–4 dpf) Note: By 4 dpf, most larvae will be hatched already and will not need to be manually dechorionated. For larvae that have not yet emerged, remove their chorions using fine-tipped tweezers. Note: While we use manual dechorionation, alternative methods that do not damage hair cells, such as enzymatic dechorionation, are also viable options and can be used for this purpose. Place remaining larvae (in Petri dishes) in an incubator overnight at 28.5 °C. Drug treatment and imaging (5 dpf) Sanitize lab space with ethanol. Prepare appropriate working concentrations of the drugs of interest. Transfer appropriate drug treatments into their respective wells in a multi-well plate. Label each plate. Caution: Make sure to read the Safety Data Sheet for the given drug and follow appropriate PPE and disposal guidelines. Make sure to check the solubility of the given drug in water before starting this. Some drug classes, like macrolides, are notoriously insoluble in water. So, having a baseline of solubility can help guide what doses to choose. Pour larvae into a cell strainer and place in a Petri dish (100 mm × 15 mm) with ICS water. Place the appropriate multi-well plate-strainer insert in a large Petri dish (150 mm × 15 mm) full of water. Transfer the appropriate number of larvae from the cell strainer into each well of the insert. (Maximum 100 larvae per 35 mL [9]; up to 11 larvae per well for a 12-well plate and up to 6 larvae per well for a 24-well plate.) Look at the number of larvae needed for each well, and add n+1 (an extra) larva to each well to account for accidental pipetting damage (e.g., if 10 larvae are being exposed to a given treatment, add 11 larvae to that well). Once each well of the insert has the appropriate number of larvae, transfer the larvae-containing insert into its respective drug treatment plate. Incubate the larvae in the drug treatment for the desired drug exposure time. While larvae are in drug treatment, warm the ICS water to 28 °C in an incubator and thaw the Tricaine stock. One hour before the larvae come out of drug treatment, turn off lights and thaw YO-PRO-1 solution (YO-PRO-1 is light sensitive). Make sure the YO-PRO-1 stock is covered with foil while in storage and while using. Note: If using myo6b::gfp, then skip this step (step C9), as well as steps C11–C12, C16–C17. Prepare Tricaine: euthanasia solution (see Recipes) and Tricaine: anesthesia solution (see Recipes). Transfer Tricaine: anesthesia solution into each well of a new multi-well plate. Place the multi-well plate with Tricaine: anesthesia solution in a 28 °C incubator until the end of the drug treatment. Use 3,500 μL per well for a 12-well plate and 1,800 μL per well for a 24-well plate. Prepare YO-PRO-1 solution (see Recipes) in a glass bottle or 50 mL tube covered in foil. Transfer YO-PRO-1 solution into each well of a new multi-well plate, cover with foil, and place in a 28 °C incubator until the end of drug treatment. Use 3,500 µL per well for a 12-well plate and 1,800 μL per well for a 24-well plate. Fill a tub (any type of water-proof receptacle that can hold > 50 mL of ICS water and with dimensions > 130 mm × 90 mm; a new large Petri dish > 130 mm in diameter can also be used here) with about 1 cm (no higher than the height of each multi-well strainer insert) of fresh ICS water for washing. After the desired length of drug treatment, promptly remove the drug treatment plate from the incubator. Dunk each multi-well strainer insert into the same ICS washing tub mentioned in step C13 three times to wash off residual drug treatment, ensuring that the larvae stay in their respective wells. (See Movie S2 for a video showing the transfer of a strainer insert between containers of solution to a reagent-containing multi-well plate. During experiments, each strainer will contain zebrafish larvae.) Transfer the multi-well strainer inserts into the plate with YO-PRO-1 solution. Cover with foil and incubate for 20 min. After 20 min, remove the insert from the YO-PRO-1 solution and dunk it into the ICS washing tub 3× to wash off residual YO-PRO-1 stain. Transfer to the plate with Tricaine: anesthesia solution. Wait about 5 min or until the larvae stop moving. Then, transfer larvae one by one to an untreated 96-well imaging plate using a P200 with a cut tip set at 75 μL. Using a regular P200 tip, remove 32 μL of liquid from each well. Image larvae using a fluorescence microscope with a robotics-assisted stage. For example, we use a Keyence model BZ-X710 microscope. Use the compressed air duster to clean the bottom of the 96-well plate. Select High Quality (14-bit) if using Keyence. Set one point for each larva, making sure to focus on the head of each larva (focus near eye area when in plane, focus near ear area when out of plane). Capture 2× images. Note: Microscope settings should be optimized for each individual experiment to ensure capturing clear and well-focused images (refer to Figure 5B for an example). For imaging AB larvae on the Keyence, we use the following reference settings for three fluorescent channels: Brightfield: 1/7500s exposure; 50% light intensity; 80% aperture stop. Note: PEPITA can effectively quantify lateral line phenotypes from images of larvae from a broad range of orientations. Variations associated with differences in positioning can be accounted for with the inclusion of sufficient replicate numbers to yield technically reproducible results. After imaging, transfer extra larvae into empty wells of the imaging plate, then add about 200 μL of Tricaine euthanasia solution to each fish-containing well to euthanize. After at least 10 min in Tricaine: euthanasia solution, put the plates in a 20 °C freezer for secondary euthanasia (please adhere to the specific guidelines outlined in your animal protocols for proper euthanasia, as approved practices may vary).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: Bustad et al. [10]. In vivo screening for toxicity-modulating drug interactions identifies antagonism that protects against ototoxicity in zebrafish. Front Pharmacol. We have validated that the PEPITA workflow produces reproducible and reliable results for single-drug screening and drug interaction studies. Its robust performance ensures consistent outcomes, making it a valuable tool for high-throughput ototoxicity assessments and the investigation of adverse drug–drug interactions. PEPITA enables the quantification of hundreds of individual fish per experiment. To evaluate the system’s ability to produce granular and reproducible results, we tested the viability of neomycin dose-response curves obtained by PEPITA. YO-PRO-1-fluorescently labeled AB fish and myo6b ::gfp fish were treated with neomycin at concentrations ranging from 0 to 128 μM for 4 h, followed by imaging and quantification of relative residual brightness using PEPITA. Figure 2 shows the dose-response measurements of 27 YO-PRO-1-labeled AB fish experiments and 7 myo6b ::gfp fish experiments, plotted with estimated log-logistic dose-responses (see Figure S1 for the experimental data plotted with experiment-specific dose-response curves). The 95% confidence intervals of the EC50 (drug dose that elicited 50% HC damage) estimated across each of the fish lines were within a 2-fold dose value (2.526–3.113 μM estimated from YO-PRO-1-stained AB fish and 9.0–19.4 μM estimated from myo6b ::gfp fish; EC50 values were estimated from log-logistic curves fitted to the experimental data points). PEPITA enables approximately 80% power to detect 2-fold changes in HC damage with 10 biological replicates (fish) per condition, for experienced users. Figure 2. Overview of the variability in neomycin dose-response curves obtained by PEPITA. (A) YO-PRO-1-stained AB fish (27 experiments). (B) myo6b ::gfp fish (7 experiments). Each point represents a different condition measured in a different experiment. The line and shaded area indicate the log-logistic curve and 95% confidence interval of the estimated dose-response. To validate the accuracy and reliability of PEPITA, we compared PEPITA’s ototoxic dose-response characterization with the gold-standard approach of counting HCs from individual neuromasts imaged by confocal microscopy. YO-PRO-1-fluorescently labeled AB fish and myo6b ::gfp fish were treated with neomycin at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 μM for 4 h. The neomycin dose response was then quantified using both PEPITA and the standard approach. The neomycin dose-response curve derived by PEPITA, based on relative fluorescence units (RFU), closely matched the estimates calculated by manual HC counting in both fish lines, yielding estimated EC50s that were within 2-fold in value ( Figure 3 , Figure S2). Figure 3. Neomycin dose response in YO-PRO-1-stained AB fish. (A) Top: Representative neomycin dose-response curve generated by PEPITA with relative fluorescence units (RFU) (EC50 = 1.4 μM). Middle and bottom: Representative image of a fish exposed to no drug (middle) and exposed to 2.5 μM neomycin (bottom), both used for PEPITA quantification. (B) Top: representative neomycin dose-response curve generated by standard approach of counting HCs from individual neuromasts (EC50 = 2.0 μM). Middle and bottom: Representative image of an individual neuromast from a fish exposed to no drug (middle) and exposed to 2.5 μM neomycin (bottom), used for HC counting. Note that PEPITA uses whole-fish images for quantification; images have been cropped for better visualization of the stained neuromasts. Scale bars: fish images = 300 μm; neuromast images = 10 μm. After confirming the reliability of single-drug dose response using PEPITA, we further validated the feasibility of investigating drug–drug interactions by screening ototoxic interactions with combinations of drug treatments. Four drug combinations with neomycin were examined and scored using PEPITA to assess the potential ototoxic drug interactions ( Figure 4 ). Negative wEOB scores indicate antagonism between neomycin and the tested drugs. Benzamil showed antagonism with neomycin, which is consistent with its known role as a potent mechanoelectrical transduction channel inhibitor that inhibits neomycin uptake. Neomycin interactions with other aminoglycosides had wEOB scores close to zero, indicating additivity, which is consistent with the drugs of the same chemical class exhibiting shared modalities of HC damage. Figure 4. Drug interaction scores [represented as windowed excess over Bliss (wEOB), x-axis] between neomycin and other drugs screened for ototoxic drug interactions, indicated in y-axis. wEOB is calculated for each well exposed to both drugs using a similar equation as excess over bliss (EOB) metric [11], with the formula EOB = R a × R b -R ab , where R a and R b are the responses of the individual drug dose exposures, and R ab is the response of the combined drug dose exposure. Wells with expected and observed responses outside 10%–90% were excluded from the aggregated calculation of the score across dose combinations for a particular drug pair, and the remaining data were averaged to yield the composite wEOB interaction score, intended to represent the overall trend of interaction between two drugs across a range of dose combinations.",

    "title": "An Improved Protocol for the Matrigel Duplex Assay: A Method to Measure Retinal Angiogenesis.",
    "abstract": "Neovascular diseases of the retina, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are proliferative retinopathies involving the growth of new blood vessels on the retina, which in turn causes impairment and potential loss of vision. A drawback of conventional angiogenesis assays is that they are not representative of the angiogenic processes in the retina. In the retina, the new blood vessels grow (from pre-existing blood vessels) and migrate into a non-perfused region of the eye including the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the vitreous, both of which contribute to vision loss. The Matrigel Duplex Assay (MDA) measures the migration of angiogenic capillaries from a primary Matrigel layer to a secondary Matrigel layer, which resembles the pathological angiogenesis in AMD and DR. The methodology of MDA is comprised of two steps. In the first step, the human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) are mixed with phenol red-containing Matrigel (in a 1:1 ratio) and seeded in the center of an 8-well chamber slide. After 24 h, a second layer of phenol red-free Matrigel is overlaid over the first layer. Over the course of the next 24 h, the HRMECs invade from the primary Matrigel layer to the secondary layer. Subsequently, the angiogenic sprouts are visualized by brightfield phase contrast microscopy and quantified by ImageJ software. The present manuscript measures the angiogenesis-inhibitory activity of the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 in primary HRMECs using the MDA. The MDA may be used for multiple applications like screening anti-angiogenic drugs, measuring the pro-angiogenic activity of growth factors, and elucidating signaling pathways underlying retinal angiogenesis in normal and disease states.",

This is because we often do experiments in serum-free conditions, so we add the FBS separately during cell culture as required. 10 mM PP2 Molecular weight of PP2 = 301.78 Weigh 6 mg of PP2 in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. In the laminar flow hood, dissolve the PP2 in 2 mL of DMSO. Vortex briefly to obtain 10 mM PP2 stock solution. Aliquot this PP2 stock solution (as 50 µL aliquots) into microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20 °C. 200 µM PP2 Thaw out one aliquot of PP2 (concentration = 10 mM) in a water bath (held at 37 °C). Add 2 µL of PP2 in 100 µL of basal EBM-2 medium. Vortex vigorously. Now the concentration of PP2 is 200 µM (called PP2-20X in the text). Use this PP2 solution as described in Section D, Step 8. Discard the remaining solution of PP2-20X. VEH-20X Add 2 µL of DMSO in 100 µL of basal EBM-2 medium. Vortex vigorously to obtain VEH-20X solution (the concentration of DMSO in this solution is 2% v/v), which is referred to as VEH-20X. Use the VEH-20X solution as described in Section D, Step 10. Discard the remaining solution of VEH-20X.\n\nProcedure Culturing HRMECs: thawing HRMECs from freezing vial Order cryopreserved HRMECs from Cell Systems. These HRMECs are isolated from normal, healthy donor tissue and supplied at passage 3 (<12 cumulative population doublings). A certificate of analysis is provided with each vial, which contains approximately 1 × 10 6 cells. After obtaining the cryopreserved cells from the vendor, they should be immediately stored in liquid nitrogen. We usually thaw the HRMECs by adding one frozen cell vial into one BioCoat T-25 and one T-75 flask. All steps are done in a laminar flow hood under aseptic conditions. Rehydration of BioCoat Collagen-coated T-25 and T-75 tissue culture flasks: The BioCoat flasks are stored at 4 °C. Take the packet containing the flasks out and allow them to come to room temperature prior to use. Warm some bicarbonate-based serum-free culture medium (such as RPMI-1640) in a 37 °C water bath. Add 5 mL of warm bicarbonate-based serum-free culture medium (such as RPMI) to the T-25 flask. Similarly, add 15 mL of warm serum-free media to the T-75 flask. We usually use warm RPMI-1640 for rehydrating the flasks. Allow the flasks to rehydrate for 2 h in a humidified tissue culture incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . After 2 h, aspirate the media from the flask, taking care not to disrupt the collagen coating. Add 10 mL of EGM-2 complete media to the rehydrated T-25 flask. Similarly, add 20 mL of EGM-2 complete media to the rehydrated T-75 flask. Important: Cryopreserved cells are very delicate. The HRMECs are typically cryopreserved in complete EGM-2 media supplemented with 5% DMSO. Thaw the vial in a 37 °C water bath by swirling the vial gently until the contents are completely thawed. Each vial contains approximately 1 × 10 6 cells at passage 3 (<12 cumulative population doublings). As soon as the vial is thawed, immediately remove the vial from the water bath, wipe it dry, and rinse it with 70% ethanol. Subsequently, transfer the vial inside a laminar flow hood. Remove the cap, being careful not to touch the interior threads with gloved fingers. Using a 1 mL sterile serological pipette, gently dispense the contents of the vial into the rehydrated BioCoat T-25 and T-75 flasks containing EGM-2 complete media ( Figure 1 ) at the recommended seeding density of 6,000 cells/cm 2 . Rinse the freezing vial with 1 mL of EGM-2 complete medium and add it to the tissue culture flasks. Important: Do not centrifuge the cells from the freezing vial. The DMSO present in the cryopreserved cells will get diluted in the EGM-2 complete media present in the flask. Therefore, the cells will not be harmed by the DMSO. Figure 1. Schematic diagram representing the establishment of human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) cultures from cryopreserved cells. The flasks should be placed flat (horizontally) in the cell culture incubator. Return the tissue culture flasks to the humidified tissue culture incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Do not disturb the culture for at least 24 h after the culture has been initiated. After 24 h, aspirate and discard the media in the flask and add fresh EGM-2 complete media to remove any residual DMSO and unattached cells. A healthy culture will display cobblestone morphology and non‐granular cytoplasm [9, 10]. Culturing HRMECs: maintenance and subculturing of HRMEC cultures Culture HRMECs to approximately 70%–80% confluence. The media should be replenished once every three days. Rehydrate the required number of BioCoat T-75 flasks (see Section A, Step 2). Rinse the cells with DPBS. Use 5 mL of DPBS for T-25 and 10 mL of DPBS for T-75 flasks. Add 3 mL of 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution into the T-75 flask (in the case of T‐25 flask, use 2 mL). Gently rock the flask to ensure that the cells are covered by Trypsin/EDTA solution. Incubate the flask at 37 °C incubator for 1–2 min or until cells are completely rounded up (monitored with inverted microscope). Gently tap the side of the flask to fully detach the cells if necessary. Add 2 mL of FBS to the T-75 flask (use 1 mL for a T-25 flask) to neutralize the Trypsin-EDTA. Using a 5 mL serological pipette, gently rinse the flask completely and transfer the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Rinse the growth surface of the flask with 10 mL of DPBS to collect the remainder of the detached cells and combine in the same 15 mL centrifuge tube from Step B6. Close and examine the flask under an inverted microscope to verify that the cell harvesting is complete. There should be less than 5% cells (of the initial density of the flask) remaining in the flask. Centrifuge the harvested cell suspension at 800× g for 5 min at room temperature using a benchtop centrifuge. Remove (aspirate) the FBS/DPBS liquid from the pellet. Gently flick the tube to dislodge the cells and resuspend them in 1 mL of EGM-2 complete medium. Count the cells using a hemocytometer and then dispense the required volume of cell suspension into the hydrated T-75 flask as recommended in see Section A, Steps 5–6. Return the flasks back to the cell culture incubator maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Working with Matrigel The Matrigel is aliquoted in ice-cold sterile Corning freezing vials and stored at -70 °C. Before starting the MDA, the required amount of Matrigel should be thawed overnight at 4 °C. The Matrigel is always kept on ice during the experiment. Matrigel is a liquid at 4 °C, and it polymerizes into a gel-like solid at 37 °C. We recommend that plasticware and reagents should be kept ice cold while handling the Matrigel. The thawed Matrigel is a thick, viscous liquid. Pipette tips should be trimmed at the tip (to increase the diameter of the tip) to transport the Matrigel in/out of the freezing vials. All microcentrifuge tubes and pipette tips should be kept ice cold while handling the Matrigel to avoid polymerization. In our laboratory, we use ice-cold serum-free RPMI-1640 as a cooling media. All pipette tips are dipped into the ice-cool media to chill them down before using them to handle Matrigel. Matrigel Duplex Assay Day 1 The assay is set up in an 8-well chamber slide. Before starting the experiment, draw the schema of the assay ( Figure 2 ). The region (with the checkered pattern) of the right side of the chamber slide is used to lift and transport the slide. Figure 2. Schema of the Matrigel Duplex Assay All experiments are performed with HRMECs between passage 3–7. The entire experiment is performed in a laminar flow hood under aseptic conditions. Grow the HRMECs cells to approximately 70%–80% confluence (in hydrated collagen-coated BioCoat T-75 flasks (please see Section A, Step 2 on instructions for rehydration of flasks) in complete EGM-2 media in a humidified environment at 37 °C (with 5% CO 2 ) in a cell culture incubator. Wash the HRMECs once with DPBS and trypsinize the flask using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA. Add 2 mL of FBS to neutralize the trypsin and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube. Rinse the flask with DPBS and transfer the solution to a 15 mL tube. Gently spin down the cells at 800× g for 5 min at room temperature in a benchtop centrifuge. Aspirate the media and resuspend the HRMECs in EGM-2 containing 4% FBS. Count the cells using the Corning cell counting chamber. Adjust the concentration of the cells to 1.6 × 10 7 cells/mL (using EGM-2 media containing 4% FBS) in a sterile 5 mL microfuge tube. This tube is labeled as TUBE A. The stock solution of PP2 (10 mM) should be diluted to a concentration of 200 µM (see Recipes) in basal EBM-2 media in a sterile microfuge tube. The PP2 is prepared at 20× working concentration and labeled as PP2-20X. The PP2-20X is the concentration of PP2 used to set up the MDA. The final concentration of PP2 to be used for the MDA is 10 µM. In a separate 1.5 mL microfuge tube, mix the cells (from TUBE A ) with PP2-20X at the ratio of 10:1 (v/v). This dilutes the PP2-20X to a concentration of 20 µM. As an example, you may add 45 µL of cell suspension (from TUBE A ) to 5 µL of the PP2-20X. Gently flick the tube so that the drug mixes well with the cell suspension. Do not vortex because this will shear (and lyse) the cells. Therefore, the new concentration of PP2 is 20 µM. This tube is labeled as TUBE B. The vehicle for the PP2-20X is 2% DMSO (hereafter referred to as VEH-20X, see Recipes). Just like in the previous step, mix the cells (from TUBE A ) with VEH-20X at the ratio of 10:1 (v/v). Do not vortex because this will shear (and lyse) the cells. Therefore, the new concentration of the vehicle is now 0.2% DMSO. This tube is labeled as TUBE B-VEH. Keep a few empty 1.5 mL microfuge tubes on ice to chill them down. Combine the cells with Matrigel at a ratio of 1:1 in an ice-cold microfuge tube. For example, mix 20 µL of Matrigel with 20 µL of cell suspension (taken from TUBE B ). Mix the cells with the Matrigel by flicking the tube. Do not allow the tube to warm up and do not generate air bubbles in the Matrigel–cell suspension while flicking. The final PP2 concentration in the tube is now 10 µM. This tube is labeled as TUBE C . Similarly, 20 µL of HRMECs (treated with 0.2% DMSO) are mixed with 20 µL of Matrigel in a separate microfuge tube. The final concentration of vehicle in the tube is now 0.1% DMSO. This tube is labeled as TUBE C-VEH. Table 1 describes the tubes A, B, and C in detail. Table 1. Description of tubes A, B, and C in the Matrigel Duplex Assay Tube name Composition of vehicle Contents of tube A HRMECs resuspended in EGM-2 media supplemented with 4% FBS at a concentration of 1.6 × 10 7 cells/mL. B 45 µL of HRMEC suspension (a concentration of 1.6 × 10 7 cells/ml, taken from TUBE A ) mixed with 5 µL of 200 µM PP2 (referred in the text as PP2-20X). Final concentration of PP2 is now 20 µM. Gently flick the tube so that the drug mixes well with the cell suspension. B-VEH The vehicle for the PP2-20X is 2% DMSO (referred in the text as VEH-20X) 45 µL of HRMEC suspension (a concentration of 1.6 × 10 7 cells/mL, taken from TUBE A ) and mixed with 5 µL of 2% DMSO (which is the vehicle for PP2-20× and also called VEH-20% in the text). C Mixture of 20 µL of Matrigel with 20 µL of cell suspension (treated with PP2 and taken from TUBE B ). Mix the cells with the Matrigel by flicking the tube. C-VEH TUBE C-VEH contains a mixture of 20 µL of Matrigel with 20 µL of cell suspension (treated with vehicle and taken from TUBE B-VEH ). Mix the cells with the Matrigel by flicking the tube. Take a chamber slide out of the packet. Place the chamber slide in a dish over a piece of tissue paper inside the laminar flow hood. Use a Kimwipe or a sterile gauze pad to prevent the chamber slide from sticking to the surface of the hood, as this may cause a disruption of the primary Matrigel layer during the transfer to the incubator. Take 6 µL of the cell suspension from TUBE C and plate it as a drop in the center of the chamber slide. Each sample is assayed in duplicate. A similar process is followed for TUBE C-VEH . The chamber slide is then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified cell culture incubator with 5% CO 2 . Below is a schematic representation of the chamber slide with the drop in the middle of the well ( Figure 3 ). We also provide a photograph of the chamber slide with the drop in the middle of the well ( Figure 4 ). Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the chamber slide with the drop in the middle of the well Note: The drop does not need to be exactly at the geometric center of the slide. The important fact to remember is that it should be centered enough so that the cells can invade radially into the secondary layer. Even if the drop (the primary layer) is slightly off center, that would be okay for the assay. Figure 4. Photograph of the chamber slide with the primary layer in the middle of the slide After 1 h, add 250 µL of EGM-2 complete media to each well. Leave the chamber slide at 37 °C (with 5% CO 2 ) for 24 h in a cell culture incubator. Thaw a vial of PR-free Matrigel overnight at 4 °C. If the assay is set up as shown in the schematic diagram above ( Figure 5 ), 1 mL of PR-free Matrigel will be required for the experiment. Figure 5. Schematic diagram of the side view of the chamber slide. (A) The components of the chamber slide have been labeled. (B) The procedure of adding the primary layer (PR-containing Matrigel and HRMECs) in the center of the chamber slide. (C) The drop is allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C (with 5% CO 2 ) in a cell culture incubator. (D) After 1 h, 250 µL of EGM-2 complete media is added to each well. Day 2 After 24 h, dilute the PR-free Matrigel with an equal volume of EGM-2 supplemented with 4% FBS. Keep this solution on ice. Look at the chamber slide under a phase contrast microscope to confirm the presence of a network of retinal endothelial cell tube–like structures within the primary Matrigel layer (the drop). Aspirate the medium from the chamber slide. Use a pipette to gently remove the medium from the cell without disturbing the drop at the center of the chamber slide. Gently overlay 200 µL of the 1:1 solution of phenol red-free Matrigel (diluted in EGM-2 supplemented with 4% FBS) over the drop. Figure 6 represents a schematic diagram of the chamber slide. The pink color drop represents the primary layer of Matrigel, and the light grey region (around the pink drop) represents the secondary layer comprised of phenol red–free Matrigel. A side view of the chamber slide is provided in Figure 7 . The chamber slide is incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (with 5% CO 2 ) in a cell culture incubator. After 1 h, add 250 µL of EGM-2 complete media to each well. Leave the chamber slide at 37 °C for 24 h in a cell culture incubator. Figure 6. Schematic diagram of the chamber slide with both the primary and secondary layers Figure 7. Schematic diagram of the side view of the chamber slide with the primary and secondary layers in the well. (A) Side view of chamber slide with the primary layer (drop in the center) covered with EGM-2 media (light red color). (B) The media is aspirated carefully. (C) The second layer comprising a 1:1 solution of EGM-2 media (containing 4% FBS) and PR-free Matrigel is overlaid on the primary layer. (D) The secondary layer (indicated by grey color) is allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. (E) Subsequently, EGM-2 media (indicated in light red color) is added to the well, and the slide is incubated at 37 °C for 24 h (with 5% CO 2 ) in a cell culture incubator. Day 3 After 24 h, observe the chamber slide under a phase contrast microscope. The angiogenic tube–like structures (from the HRMECs in the primary Matrigel layer) should be clearly seen invading radially into the secondary Matrigel layer. Photograph three independent fields (at 10× magnification) for each sample for quantitative analysis. Processing the images using Adobe Illustrator and ImageJ The figure shown below shows the representative images obtained from the MDA. The black arrows indicate the sprouting angiogenic HRMEC tube–like structures, which have invaded the secondary Matrigel layer from the primary layer ( Figure 8 ). Figure 8. Representative photographs obtained from the Matrigel Duplex Assay (MDA). The black arrows indicate the angiogenic tube–like structures invading into the secondary layer. Open the images in Adobe Illustrator 2023. Using the pen curvature tool, draw a dotted line across the interface between the two layers. A representative image with the dotted lines is shown below ( Figure 9 ). Figure 9. Drawing the dotted line at the interface of the two layers using Adobe Illustrator 2023 Export the images to Adobe Photoshop 2023 and save them in jpeg format. Open the jpeg files in ImageJ. Using the line tool, draw a set of six lines marking the distance that the angiogenic tube–like structures have invaded into the secondary Matrigel layer ( Figure 10 ). After drawing each line, press CTRL-M to obtain the length of the line drawn. Cease drawing the line upon encountering a gap larger than two cells. Our microscope images were analyzed using the ImageJ program by three independent observers in a double-blind manner. The raw data is provided in Supplementary information. Figure 10. Representative image of the Matrigel Duplex Assay (MDA) with lines drawn using Adobe Illustrator Open GraphPad Prism (Version 9). Using the numbers obtained by the ImageJ program, create a column graph of the data and perform statistical analysis ( Figure 11 ). The statistical analysis of the data is also described in the Data analysis section. Figure 11. Microscope images were analyzed by the ImageJ program (by three independent observers). Data were graphically represented using GraphPad Prism (Version 9). Data were analyzed through an unpaired non-parametric t -test followed by the Mann-Whitney test.

    "title": "Iterative Immunostaining and NEDD Denoising for Improved Signal-To-Noise Ratio in ExM-LSCM.",
    "abstract": "Expansion microscopy (ExM) has significantly reformed the field of super-resolution imaging, emerging as a powerful tool for visualizing complex cellular structures with nanoscale precision. Despite its capabilities, the epitope accessibility, labeling density, and precision of individual molecule detection pose challenges. We recently developed an iterative indirect immunofluorescence (IT-IF) method to improve the epitope labeling density, improving the signal and total intensity. In our protocol, we iteratively apply immunostaining steps before the expansion and exploit signal processing through noise estimation, denoising, and deblurring (NEDD) to aid in quantitative image analyses. Herein, we describe the steps of the iterative staining procedure and provide instructions on how to perform NEDD-based signal processing. Overall, IT-IF in ExM-laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) represents a significant advancement in the field of cellular imaging, offering researchers a versatile tool for unraveling the structural complexity of biological systems at the molecular level with an increased signal-to-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity. Key features • Builds upon the method developed by Mäntylä et al. [1] and introduces the IT-IF method and signal-processing platform for several nanoscopy imaging applications. • Retains signal-to-noise ratio and significantly enhances the fluorescence intensity of ExM-LSCM data. • Automatic estimation of noise, signal reconstruction, denoising, and deblurring for increased reliability in image quantifications. • Requires at least seven days to complete.",

Note: Prior to culturing the cells, sterilize coverslips by rinsing three times with dH 2 O and three times in absolute EtOH and air dry for 20 min under UV light inside a laminar hood. Follow cell line–specific instructions in seeding and culturing the cells. If required, coverslips can be protein-coated to enhance cell attachment to the coverslip. To fix the sample, add 20% PFA to a final concentration of 4% directly into the medium (400 µL in 2 mL of medium) in a laboratory fume hood. Tilt for an even spread and incubate for 10 min at RT. After fixation, discard the PFA-containing medium and wash the sample two times with 2 mL of 1× PBS (with Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ ). Leave in 2 mL of 1× PBS. Proceed to iterative indirect immunostaining (IT-IF) by performing the first iteration: Note: The first iteration corresponds to traditional immunostaining. Permeabilize the sample for 10 min at RT with 1 mL of the permeabilization buffer A (see Recipes). Dilute the primary antibody/antibodies (Ab/Abs) of choice according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the antibody dilution solution containing 3% BSA as the blocking reagent. Use the recommended and optimized concentrations. Note: Careful optimization of the antibody concentration/dilution is required before proceeding to iterative immunostaining. Transfer the sample-containing coverslip to a clear 6-well plate/35 mm dish for immunostaining by using tweezers. Carefully dip dry the sample on paper to remove excess buffer before adding the primary Ab to avoid uneven spread and dilution of the primary Ab. Add 100 µL of the primary Ab solution to the coverslip and incubate for 1 h at RT. After primary Ab incubation, wash once with permeabilization buffer A, once with PBS, and again with the permeabilization buffer A (each wash with 1 mL for 10 min at RT). Use tweezers to dip dry samples into paper and move them to a clean 6-well plate/35 mm dish for the next staining step. Prepare for the secondary staining by diluting the species-specific and cross-reacted Alexa Fluor 488 -conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary Ab 1:200 to the Antibody diluent solution containing 3% BSA. Protect from light. For secondary staining, add 100 µL of the secondary Ab solution to the coverslip and incubate for 1 h at RT in the dark. After secondary Ab incubation, wash the sample once with the permeabilization buffer A for 10 min, with 1× PBS for 10 min, and again with permeabilization buffer A for 10 min at RT (1 mL each) in the dark. For iterating the staining, repeat primary and secondary immunostaining as described in steps A3b–i four times (four-time iteration) using the same Ab concentration. Note: Use permeabilization buffer B (see Recipes) for all the subsequent permeabilization steps in iterations 2–4. Permeabilization buffer B contains a reduced concentration of Triton X-100 (0.2%). After the washes following iteration 4, wash the sample once in PBS and once in dH 2 O (10 min at RT in the dark). Proceed to anchoring the preceding polymer gel casting. For an alternative post-gelling immunostaining technique, see General note 1. Anchoring treatment Prepare the anchoring solution (see Recipes). Place the sample on a fresh 6-well plate. Pipette approximately 150–200 µL of the anchoring solution on the coverslip containing the cell sample. Incubate the sample for > 6 h at RT. Note: This reaction can be left overnight. Wash 2 × 15 min with 2 mL of 1× PBS before proceeding to gelation. Samples can be stored at 4 °C in PBS in the dark before proceeding with the protocol. Gelling Note: Tools used in this section are presented in Figure 1 . Cut parafilm to a slightly larger size than the glass coverslip (18 mm × 18 mm) and do not remove the covering paper. Add one drop of glue to the coverslip and stick the parafilm to the glue with its paper-covered side facing up. Press gently and let dry. Since the gel does not adhere to parafilm, the parafilm-mounted coverslip will be used as the bottom of the gelation chamber. See Figure 1A showing the parafilm-mounted coverslip upside down to demonstrate the respective sizes of the parafilm and the coverslips after gluing. Note: The parafilm prevents the gels from sticking to the top glass slide. With the covering paper facing up, place the parafilm-mounted coverslip on a 6-well plate lid/60 mm Petri dish and remove the covering paper to expose the clean parafilm surface on the coverslip ( Figure 1B ). Place the in-house 3D-printed spacer ( Figure 1C ) on the exposed parafilm surface of the coverslip ( Figure 1D ). Note: This spacer controls the circular shape, size (opening r = 5 mm), and height (350 µm) of the polymer gel in the gelation phase. The size of the polymerized gel is required for calculating the expansion factor after the expansion. By using the in-house printed 3D spacers, the size of the gel is always constant and equals the size of the spacer opening. However, the size of the gel can also be measured using a caliper. Cool a new 2 mL Eppendorf tube on ice. Prepare Gelling solution (see Recipes) in the 2 mL Eppendorf placed on ice. Note: Do not add initiator (APS) yet! One can prepare two samples from one gelling solution aliquot at the same time. Once ready with the samples, add 10% APS (Recipe 7) to the gelation solution, vortex briefly, and immediately pipette 70 µL of gelation solution into the middle of the opening of the 3D-printed spacer placed on the parafilm-mounted coverslip ( Figure 1E ). The spacer controls the circular shape, size (opening r = 5 mm), and height (350 µm) of the polymer gel in the gelation phase. Note: Pipetted volume depends on the sample size, so you might need to scale this if, e.g., tissue samples are being used. Carefully but rapidly place the sample coverslip containing the immunolabeled cells on top of the gelling solution droplet with cells facing down, i.e., toward the droplet of gelling solution. The cells will be inside the gel after polymerization. Note: Remove any extra PBS from the sample coverslip by touching it with tissue paper. This prevents PBS from diluting the gel solution. Add a metal hex nut on top of the sample ( Figure 1F ). Protect the sample from light by covering them, e.g., with tinfoil, and let the gel polymerize for 30–45 min at RT. After polymerization, carefully remove the hex nut and flip the sample (sandwiched coverslips containing the spacer and the polymerized gel in between) so that after flipping, the parafilm-mounted coverslip is on top and the sample-containing coverslip is at the bottom. Remove the parafilm-mounted coverslip by gripping the parafilm edge with tweezers. Discard the parafilm-mounted coverslip. Remove the spacer. A circular gel remains on the sample coverslip with cells located at the bottom (facing the sample coverslip). If needed, use a scalpel to cut and remove any excess gel. Note: The expansion will increase the gel size by approximately 4×, thus gels over 1 cm will be difficult to handle. Place the gel (still attached to the sample coverslip) into a fresh well of a 6-well plate with the gel facing up. The diameter of the polymerized gel is required for calculating the expansion factor after the expansion. By using the in-house-printed 3D spacers with known dimensions, the diameter of the gel is always constant and equals the diameter of the spacer opening (d = 10 mm). However, the diameter or some other size-related parameter of the gel can also be measured after the polymerization by using a caliper, especially if a spacer has not been used for casting the gel ( Figure 1L ). The expansion factor (equation described in section E) is required for pixel size quantification of the microscopy images. Note: The gel will start to swell during the next digestion step; thus, it is crucial to measure the original gel size before that step. Figure 1.

An example of a digital caliper used to measure the PAA-hydrogel after isotropic expansion in water to determine the expansion factor before proceeding to the gel cutting and mounting to the coverslip cell chamber. Digestion Prepare the digestion solution (see Recipes). Digest the polymerized gel containing the cell sample on a 60 mm Petri dish with the digesting solution by adding at least 10-fold excess volume of digestion buffer (e.g., ~2 mL) overnight (12 h) in the dark at RT. During the digestion, the gel with the cells inside will detach from the sample coverslip. The coverslip can remain in the Petri dish, but it can also be discarded. Note: Do not peel the gels off the surface of the glass as this will damage the sample! After digestion, move the polymerized gel by using a spoon/spatula to a fresh 60 mm Petri dish. Note: If the coverslip is already detached, you can remove it from under the sample and discard it. Expansion Expand the gel sample isotropically by adding an excess volume of dH 2 O (e.g., 20 mL/60 mm dish). Incubate for 1 h in the dark at RT. Note: Use at least 10× the final gel volume. Discard water carefully and replace it with fresh water. Notes: The gel has the same refractive index as water. Use caution when removing the water. Avoid vacuum aspiration. Gel expansion reaches a plateau after the third or fourth wash. Repeat steps E1–2 at least five times. After removing the water for the last time, measure the diameter (or other size-related parameters as described in step C12) of the expanded gel with a caliper ( Figure 1L ). Calculate the expansion factor using the following equation. E x p a n s i o n f a c t o r = G e l d i a m e t e r p o s t e x p a n s i o n G e l d i a m e t e r p r i o r e x p a n s i o n Note: By casting the gel in the opening (r = 5 mm, height 350 µm) of the in-house printed 3D spacer, a circular gel with known dimensions will be produced. The diameter of the spacer opening can be used as the pre-expansion gel diameter. After the expansion of the polymerized gel, measure the expanded gel diameter and use that as a post-expansion gel diameter to calculate the expansion factor. For traditional ExM, the expansion factor is near 4. Use this factor to determine the real size of your objects, for example during image analysis as described below in Data analysis section. Sample mounting and microscopy Note: The tools used in this section are presented in Figure 1 . After the isotropic expansion in water, cut a circular piece of the expanded gel with a 3D-printed mold ( Figure 1G ). Put the gel with the mold still attached on a new 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip. Place it inside the Aireka coverslip cell chamber ( Figure 1H –J). Place a 13 mm diameter glass coverslip on top of the gel and add a 9 mm hex nut to the top to keep the gel in place during mounting in the next step ( Figure 1G –K). Mount the gel-containing mold in the coverslip cell chamber with melted 1% high-melt agarose. Caution: Hot agarose is a burn hazard! Note: A volume of 50 mL of high-melt agarose can be melted in a microwave in a glass bottle with a cap only loosely placed on top. Use 800 W power in 30 s intervals and swirl the bottle gently between the intervals. Avoid bubbles. Repeat until completely liquid and clear. Avoid overheating or boiling the agarose in the microwave. Let cool down at RT for 5–10 min. Add slightly cooled melted agarose (≤ 1 mL) to the empty sides between the mold and the chamber (not inside the mold/on top of the sample!) by pipetting with a Pasteur pipette. The agarose should not enter under the gel. Add dH 2 O on top of the sample inside the mold to prevent the sample from drying and shrinking. The coverslip and the nut can be left in place and kept there during imaging to ensure that the sample stays in place to avoid drift. The Aireka coverslip cell chamber fits in a regular 35 mm dish sample holder on a confocal microscopy stage. After placing it, let the temperature stabilize before the imaging. After 15–30 min, acquire images according to your needs. Note: Imaging can be done according to the analysis requirements. For imaging, use a water immersion (WI) objective with a high working distance and numerical aperture (N.A.) such as Nikon CFI Plan Apo IR SR 60× WI, N.A. 1.27, with a working distance of 0.17 mm. To acquire images for quantitative analysis, record an optical z-section series of 1,024 × 1,024 pixels (or similar) with a pixel size ≤ 50–70 nm in the x- and y-directions and ≤ 200 nm in the z-direction for optimal resolution and pixel size for mathematical deconvolution or signal processing. NEDD denoising Before analyzing the data, our open-access signal processing software NEDD (MATLAB) is recommended to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the images acquired from samples prepared with the above protocol for ExM. Our NEDD pipeline in MATLAB assumes the noise to be additive, spatially correlated, and with signal-dependent variance [10]. Note: The NEDD can process any LSCM image data and is not restricted to ExM. The pseudo-algorithm of the NEDD pipeline can be summarized as follows: Estimate the noise variance and power spectral density (PSD) of the data. Apply a variance stabilizing transform (VST) to the data using the noise parameters estimated in the previous step. We use the generalized Anscombe transform [11]. Denoise the stabilized data using the iterative framework introduced in [12]. The denoising filter used within the framework is the RF3D algorithm designed for processing videos (three-dimensional data) corrupted by correlated noise [13]. Apply the inverse VST to return the data to its original intensity domain. OPTIONAL: Perform deconvolution (deblurring) of the denoised sequence using a regularized Tikhonov deconvolution approach [14]. The software comes with a demo ( demo.m ), that can be run to demonstrate its usage, which can be called with the command: noisy,denoised,deblurred]=processData(inputPath,outputPath,noiseModel,optionalParams) where the inputs are: inputPath : A string containing the path to the input noisy file. The file must be in single-channel gray-scale multi-page TIFF format. outputPath: A string containing the path where to store the single-channel gray-scale multi-page TIFF output. noiseModel : A string that defines the noise model to be assumed for estimation and denoising. It can be either white or colored. optionalParams: A MATLAB struct variable that contains optional parameters that can be used to adjust, e.g., the denoising filter and the deblurring parameters. More details can be found in the function’s help. The function will write the processed data into the outputPath. Additionally, the function returns to the workspace: noisy : The noisy data (M × N × F double array) read from inputPath. denoised : The denoised data (M × N × F double array). deblurred : The deblurred data (M × N × F double array)\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research articles: Iterative immunostaining and denoising protocol: Mäntylä et al.

    "title": "Live-Cell Monitoring of Piecemeal Chloroplast Autophagy.",
    "abstract": "When plants undergo senescence or experience carbon starvation, leaf cells degrade proteins in the chloroplasts on a massive scale via autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved process in which intracellular components are transported to the vacuole for degradation to facilitate nutrient recycling. Nonetheless, how portions of chloroplasts are released from the main chloroplast body and mobilized to the vacuole remains unclear. Here, we developed a method to observe the autophagic transport of chloroplast proteins in real time using confocal laser-scanning microscopy on transgenic plants expressing fluorescently labeled chloroplast components and autophagy-associated membranes. This protocol enabled us to track changes in chloroplast morphology during chloroplast-targeted autophagy on a timescale of seconds, and it could be adapted to monitor the dynamics of other intracellular processes in plant leaves. Key features • This protocol enables real-time monitoring of chloroplast morphology in living Arabidopsis leaves. • The method is based on confocal microscopy of transgenic plants that express fluorescent protein markers for specific organelles or suborganellar compartments. • We used this protocol to monitor the piecemeal autophagic degradation of chloroplasts, but it could also be extended to other intracellular phenomena.",

Plastic wrap 16. Aluminum foil\n\nProcedure A. Growth of Arabidopsis plants A1. Cold stratification treatment 1. Place Arabidopsis seeds into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The number of seeds is approximately four times the number of plants required for each analysis. 2. Add 500–1,000 μL of ultrapure water to the tube. 3. Cover the tube with aluminum foil to exclude light. 4. Place the tube in a refrigerator at 4 °C for 2–4 days. A2. Seed sowing and plant cultivation 1. Mix the potting soil and vermiculite in a 1:1 ratio. 2. Fill individual cells of a plastic cell tray with the prepared soil. 3. Place the plastic cell tray into the plastic tray. 4. Shower tap water onto the soil surface without allowing it to overflow. Repeat the watering process until the soil is completely moist; 10 watering passes are typically sufficient. 5. Discard the outflow water from the bottom of the cell tray. 6. Transfer the stratified seeds from the tube to the soil surface using a 200 μL micropipette fitted with a 200 μL wide-bore pipette tip. We normally sow approximately four seeds in each individual cell. 7. Cover the cell tray with plastic wrap. 8. Place the plastic tray containing the wrapped cell tray into a growth chamber (23 °C, 12/12 h light/dark photoperiod, 90–130 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 photon flux density) for germination. 9. Remove the plastic wrap when most of the seeds have germinated, typically 2–4 days after sowing. 10. Remove the smaller plants and equalize the number of plants (to one or two plants) in individual cells approximately 14 days after sowing. 11. Grow plants for 20–24 days after sowing ( Figure 1A ) and use their second rosette leaves for the following steps. Water with tap water twice a week. Add Hyponex solution (1:2,000 dilution) to the tap water once a week to prevent mineral nutrient deficiencies. B. Pretreatment of leaves Note: Here, we describe the pretreatment used to observe morphological changes in chloroplasts in response to sugar starvation. This treatment could be replaced by other treatments, depending on the purpose of the experiments. 1. Add 1 mL of MES buffer to each well of a 12-well cell culture plate. 2. Using stainless steel scissors, excise the second rosette leaf from each soil-grown plant at the end of a 12-h dark period. Critical: Timing the initiation of dark incubation is critical for the induction of sugar starvation in Arabidopsis leaves. Because they accumulate starch during the daytime, it is best to collect leaves for incubation at the end of the dark period when most of this starch has been consumed. All subsequent steps in the protocol should be performed under dim light. 3. Place the leaf on a fingertip using stainless steel tweezers ( Figure 1B ). 4. Flip the leaf to expose its abaxial surface ( Figure 1B , left panel). 5. Remove the air from a 1-mL plastic syringe by repeatedly drawing and ejecting MES buffer. Three to four repetitions are typically sufficient. Then, draw approximately 300 μL of MES buffer into the syringe. 6. Gently press the tip of the syringe onto the abaxial leaf surface and infiltrate the MES buffer into the leaf with moderate pressure by pushing the plunger ( Figure 1B , right panel). Less than 10 μL is sufficient for a second rosette leaf. Caution: Intense pressure caused by rapidly pushing the plunger may cause the infiltration solution to scatter. 7. Place the infiltrated leaves into a well of the cell culture plate ( Figure 1C ). 8. Place the plate in a temperature-controlled incubator at 23 °C. Leave the lid of the plate slightly open for ventilation. 9. Incubate the plate in darkness for 5–8 h. This treatment induces sugar starvation and activates the autophagic degradation of chloroplasts. Note: This infiltration treatment also deaerates the leaves, improving the resolution of fluorescent signals during confocal microscopy. When obtaining a snapshot of fluorescent signals in leaf cells, such as the localization of a fluorescent protein or the number of fluorescent protein–labeled organelles, ultrapure water can be used for deaeration, followed by immediate observation with confocal microscopy. For time-lapse monitoring of living leaf cells, the use of a mildly acidic buffer is likely suitable. Although we do not examine how the difference in extracellular pH affects intracellular phenomena, we once observed the inhibition of chloroplast-targeting autophagy when the leaves were accidentally incubated in a pH-unadjusted solution. The infiltration treatment also helps to provide a uniform supply of chemicals to the leaves. For example, we used this infiltration treatment to supply concanamycin A to Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll cells, which stabilized the chloroplast-derived bodies transported by autophagy in the vacuolar lumen [2,5]. Therefore, in this protocol, we infiltrated the MES buffer that does not contain concanamycin A to monitor how portions of chloroplasts are released as small bodies and then transported into the vacuole by autophagy. Figure 1. Sugar starvation treatment and confocal microscopy observation of living Arabidopsis leaves. (A) ProRBCS2B:RBCS2B-mRFP plants expressing a fluorescently tagged chloroplast stromal marker protein were grown for 21 days in soil. (B) Infiltration of MES buffer into the second rosette leaf of a 21-day-old plant. The excised leaf is placed on a fingertip with its abaxial surface facing upward (left). The tip of a 1-mL syringe is used to infiltrate the MES buffer into the leaf with moderate pressure (right). (C) Infiltrated leaves are incubated in a 12-well cell culture plate in the dark. (D) After incubation, the edge of a leaf is removed, placed in a glass-bottom dish, and covered with a round cover glass. (E) The dish is placed on an inverted confocal microscopy system (Zeiss LSM 900) for observation. C. Confocal microscopy observation of chloroplast morphology 1. Excise the outer edge of the pretreated leaf with stainless steel scissors immediately before observation. 2. Place the resulting leaf fragment into the glass-bottom dish so that its adaxial surface is in contact with the glass bottom. 3. Place approximately 200 μL of MES buffer around the leaf fragment in the dish. 4. Gently place a round cover glass onto the leaf fragment. The MES buffer should pull the cover glass down onto the leaf fragment to form a seal ( Figure 1D ). If the leaf fragment is not surrounded by MES buffer or large bubbles are present, the adaxial surface of the leaf fragment does not closely adhere to the glass bottom. 5. Place the glass-bottom dish onto the stage of the confocal laser-scanning microscope ( Figure 1E ). Use an inverted confocal system for this protocol. 6. Capture the fluorescence signals of each fluorescent marker protein. An example of the microscope settings used to detect GFP, mRFP, and chlorophyll fluorescence is shown in Table 1 . Figure 2A shows the fluorescence signals of RBCS-mRFP and chlorophyll in leaves from wild-type and ProRBCS2B:RBCS2B-mRFP plants exposed to sugar starvation treatment (dark) or left untreated (control). Untreated leaves were excised from 21-day-old plants grown in the growth chamber immediately before observation and treated as described in steps B3–B6 and C1–C5. The magnified image in Figure 2A and the images in Figure 2B show examples of chloroplast budding structures visualized using RBCS-mRFP in leaves from the dark treatment. Note: The observation settings can be modified for different equipment and sample types. We recommend observing wild-type Arabidopsis plants that do not express fluorescent proteins to distinguish the fluorescent protein signals from the false signals derived from cellular structures ( Figure 1A ). Likewise, when leaves are exposed to treatments such as the sugar starvation treatment described here, such false signals should be ruled out by observing wild-type plants exposed to the same treatments, as stresses and related cellular damage can enhance the autofluorescence of cellular structures. For instance, photodamaged chloroplasts in the cytoplasm and chloroplasts undergoing digestion in the vacuole emit faint, broad signals in addition to the chlorophyll-specific signal [9]. When observing plants that express two different fluorescent proteins, also check the plants that express each protein individually to confirm that fluorescence crosstalk does not occur ( Figure 2A ). Table 1. Confocal microscope (LSM 900) settings used to detect fluorescent protein and chlorophyll signals in this study Type of fluorescent signal Excitation wavelength Detection wavelength Green fluorescent protein (GFP) 488 nm 410–546 (or 550) nm Red fluorescent protein (RFP) 561 nm 550–640 nm Chlorophyll 488 or 640 nm 656–700 nm Figure 2. Observations of chloroplast budding structures in Arabidopsis leaves exposed to sugar starvation treatment. (A) Confocal microscopy images of mesophyll cells from leaves incubated in the dark for 5–8 h from dawn (Dark) or from leaves excised immediately before observations from plants grown in the light (Control). Second rosette leaves were harvested from soil-grown, 21-day-old wild-type or ProRBCS2B:RBCS2B-mRFP (RBCS-mRFP) plants. The area surrounded by blue dashed lines is magnified in the bottom left corner of the image. (B) Additional images of chloroplast budding structures visualized using RBCS-mRFP in leaves exposed to the dark treatment described in (A). Arrowheads indicate the chloroplast budding structures. Green, RFP; magenta, chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence. Laser power settings: 1.0% for 561 nm; 0.5% for 640 nm. Scale bars, 10 μm. 7. Observe Arabidopsis leaves expressing the fluorescently labeled stromal marker protein together with markers of other cellular components to determine whether the chloroplast budding structures contain or interact with other compartments. Figure 3A shows images obtained from leaves expressing the chloroplast stromal marker RBCS-GFP together with the chloroplast inner-envelope marker KEA1-mRFP, the chloroplast outer-envelope marker TOC64-mRFP, or the thylakoid membrane marker ATPC1-tagRFP. The images reveal that the chloroplast budding structures visualized with RBCS-GFP contain chloroplast envelope proteins but not thylakoid membrane proteins. Figure 3B shows images obtained from leaves expressing the chloroplast stromal marker RBCS-mRFP together with the isolation membrane marker GFP-ATG8a. These images reveal that the chloroplast budding structures are surrounded by isolation membranes. These results are consistent with the findings of our previous study, which also used this protocol [7]. 8. Use the Time Series function in the Acquisition tab of ZEN software for time-lapse monitoring. To monitor the formation of chloroplast budding structures, locate the chloroplast-associated isolation membrane labeled by GFP-ATG8a ( Figure 3C , left panel) through live scans of the wide field without cropping the scan area. Then, narrow the scan area until the isolation membrane is magnified and begin the time-lapse imaging. Figure 3C and Video 1 show an example of a chloroplast budding structure forming concurrently with the development of the isolation membrane. Critical: We sequentially detected the GFP, RFP, and chlorophyll signals using two different tracks to minimize crosstalk among the different fluorescence signals. The first track detects the GFP and chlorophyll signals simultaneously, while the other detects the RFP signal. Select Switch track every line in the Imaging Setup box of ZEN software to minimize the time lag between the tracks. Figure 3. Monitoring chloroplast budding structures in living Arabidopsis leaves co-expressing two different fluorescent marker proteins. (A) Confocal microscopy images of mesophyll chloroplasts from second rosette leaves incubated in the dark for 5–8 h from dawn (Dark) at 23 days after sowing. Arabidopsis plants harbored the chloroplast stromal marker ProRBCS2B:RBCS2B-sGFP (RBCS-GFP) either alone or together with the chloroplast inner-envelope marker ProKEA1:KEA1-mRFP (KEA1-mRFP), the chloroplast outer-envelope marker ProTOC64:TOC64-mRFP (TOC64-mRFP), or the thylakoid membrane marker ProATPC1:ATPC1-tagRFP (ATPC1-tagRFP). Among the three RFP proteins, KEA1-mRFP exhibited the weakest signal, and the most sensitive microscope settings were required to detect it clearly. Leaves from RBCS-GFP plants and plants with both RBCS-GFP and KEA1-mRFP were observed using the same settings to ensure that there was no RBCS-GFP signal crosstalk in the channel for RFP. Laser power settings: 0.8% for 488 nm; 7.0% (ATPC1-tagRFP) or 9.0% (TOC64-mRFP and KEA1-mRFP) for 561 nm. Arrowheads indicate chloroplast budding structures.

    "title": "Visualization of mRNA Translation Within Germ Granule Biphasic Organization in Drosophila Early Embryo.",
    "abstract": "Super-resolution imaging of RNA-protein (RNP) condensates has shown that most are composed of different immiscible phases reflected by a heterogenous distribution of their main components. Linking RNA-protein condensate's inner organization with their different functions in mRNA regulation remains a challenge, particularly in multicellular organisms. Drosophila germ granules are a model of RNA-protein condensates known for their role in mRNA storage and localized protein production in the early embryo. Present at the posterior pole of the embryo within a specialized cytoplasm called germplasm, they are composed of maternal mRNAs as well as four main proteins that play a key role in germ granule formation, maintenance, and function. Germ granules are necessary and sufficient to drive germ cell formation through translational regulation of maternal mRNAs such as nanos. Due to their localization at the posterior tip of the ovoid embryo and small size, the classical imaging setup does not provide enough resolution to reach their inner organization. Here, we present a specific mounting design that reduces the distance between the germ granule and the objectives. This method provides optimal resolution for the imaging of germ granules by super-resolution microscopy, allowing us to demonstrate their biphasic organization characterized by the enrichment of the four main proteins in the outermost part of the granule. Furthermore, combined with the direct visualization of nanos mRNA translation using the Suntag approach, this method enables the localization of translation events within the germ granule's inner organization and thus reveals the spatial organization of its functions. This approach reveals how germ granules serve simultaneously as mRNA storage hubs and sites of translation activation during development. This work also highlights the importance of considering condensates' inner organization when investigating their functions. Key features • Method for super-resolution imaging of germ granules in Drosophila early embryo. • Analysis of RNP condensate functional organization. • Simultaneous recording of RNP condensate function and organization.",

Fly crosses and embryo fixation 1. Cross scFv-GFP virgin females with suntag-nos/Cyo males ( Figure 1A ) in tubes or bottles with fly culture medium and maintain them at 25 °C, putting the adult flies into new tubes/bottles every two days. 2. Select and collect from the F1 suntag-nos/+ ; scFv-GFP/+ female flies. Put them with wild-type ( w 1118 ) males in an embryo collection cage with a collection plate at the bottom (hereafter, this setup is referred to as a cage). Keep the cage at 25 °C. 3. The next day, change the collection plate, let the females lay for 1 h at 25 °C, and discard the plate since embryos are often of varied ages as females retain their eggs during overnight laying. Add a fresh collection plate. 4. Let the females lay for 1.5 h at 25 °C and collect the plate ( Figure 1B ). This collection will have embryos aged from 0 to 1.5 h. 5. Add tap water to the collection plate, gently detach the embryos from the plate using the brush, and pour them into the collection basket. Wash them thoroughly with tap water to remove the yeast and culture medium. 6. To remove the chorion, plunge the collection basket with the embryos in 30 mL of 2.6% bleach in a 100 mL beaker ( Figure 1C ). Using a Pasteur pipette, flush the embryos toward the bottom of the basket 2–3 times, put on the platform shaker, and rotate at 125 rpm for 3 min. An indication of effective dechorionization is that the white embryos will become translucent and float at the surface of the dechorionization solution. 7. Wash the embryos in the basket thoroughly with tap water to remove the bleach. 8. Quickly dry the basket and plunge it into 30 mL of n-heptane in a 100 mL beaker. Dechorionated embryos float at the surface of aqueous solutions but will sink to the bottom of the basket in heptane, allowing a quick collection with a Pasteur pipette. Alternatively, they can be collected on the dry basket with a brush. 9. Pour the embryos into a scintillation vial containing 5 mL of 36% formaldehyde and 5 mL of heptane ( Figure 1D ). The embryos will stay at the interphase between the formaldehyde (lower phase) and n-heptane (upper phase). 10. Put the vial on a platform shaker and rotate at 125 rpm for 5 min. 11. Using a Pasteur pipette, remove the formaldehyde (lower phase), add 5 mL of methanol, and proceed to embryo devitellinization by vortexing for 1 min ( Figure 1E ). Devitellinized embryos sink to the bottom of the vial. Embryos that are not devitellinized will stay at the methanol/heptane interphase and must be discarded. 12. Remove the n-heptane (upper phase). Collect the embryos at the bottom of the vial with a Pasteur pipette and transfer them to a 2 mL tube. Wash three times with methanol. Embryos can be stored in methanol at -20 °C for months. Figure 1. Generation of fixed Drosophila embryos for the visualization of nanos mRNA translation. (A) Representation of the Drosophila cross needed to obtain females that will produce embryos containing the components allowing the visualization of nanos mRNA translation (ScFv-GFP protein and suntag-nos mRNA). (B) Embryo collection. Females suntag-nos/+ ; scFv-GFP/+ from the cross represented in (A) are placed in a collection cage with wild-type males and left to lay for 1.5 h at 25 °C. Laid embryos are collected and washed with water in a collection basket. (C) Embryo dechorionization. Embryos are sunk in 2.6% bleach for 3 min with agitation. Then, they are thoroughly washed and plunged into n-heptane. (D) Embryo fixation. Embryos are transferred in a 1:1 ratio of heptane to 36% formaldehyde and fixed for 5 min with agitation. (E) Embryo devitellinization and storage. Replace formaldehyde with the same volume of methanol and vortex for 1 min. Transfer embryos at the bottom of the vial in a tube and wash thrice with methanol. Embryos can be stored at -20 °C for months. B. Immunostaining and mounting 1. Progressively rehydrate embryos by incubating them on a rotating wheel for 5 min with 1.5 mL of 75%, 50%, and then 25% of methanol diluted in PBST. Devitellinized embryos will sink in aqueous solutions and will thus settle at the bottom of the tube, and solutions can be removed from the top. 2. Quickly rinse twice with PBST and incubate in PBST for 30 min on a rotating wheel. 3. Block for 3 h in 1 mL of 10% BSA on a rotating wheel. 4. Remove the BSA and add the primary antibody (pre-adsorbed rabbit anti-Osk used to visualize germ granules diluted at 1/1,000 in PBST) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. 5. Remove the primary antibody and wash three times for 10 min in PBST. 6. Add the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Abberior Star 580, 1/1,000) and anti-GFP FluoTagX4 Abberior Star Red (1/500) diluted in PBST to visualize scFv-GFP foci (i.e., translation foci) and incubate for 1 h at room temperature in the dark on a rotating wheel. Abberior STAR dyes are recommended for STED microscopy as they have been designed to withstand depletion due to their high brightness and photostability. However, we also used other fluorophores such as Cy3-coupled secondary antibodies. In that case, we had to decrease the intensity power of the depletion laser to avoid bleaching and thus decreased a bit the resolution that is dictated by this parameter [15]. 7. Wash three times for 10 min in PBST. Remove the PBST and add 60–100 μL of Abberior mount. Leave at 4 °C in the dark for at least 2 h. 8. Using a pipette, put a drop of embryos on a slide with as little mounting medium as possible. Under the stereomicroscope, select 20–30 embryos of the appropriate stage, namely syncytial embryos without germ cells that can be seen as buds on the tip of the embryo ( Figure 2A ). Figure 2. Mounting of Drosophila posterior pole for super-resolution microscopy. (A) Stereomicroscope image (top) and scheme (bottom) of syncytial embryos. Note that the posterior pole is slightly rounder than the anterior pole. (B) Stereomicroscope images (top) and schemes (bottom) of the slicing and positioning of the posterior pole of syncytial embryos. (C) Stereomicroscope image (top) and scheme (bottom) of mounted sliced posterior poles. (D) Confocal and STED images of suntag-nos/+ ; scFv-GFP/+ embryos immunostained with the germ granule marker Osk (magenta) and GFP (green) to reveal scFv-GFP foci. Scale bar: 1 μm. 9. One embryo at a time, move it to the side where there is less mounting medium to facilitate the slicing and identify the position of the posterior pole. On the ovoid embryo, the posterior is slightly rounder than the anterior pole. 10. Using a fine needle, slice the posterior pole, push it to the center of the slide, and place it with the posterior pole facing upward, discarding the rest of the embryo ( Figure 2B ). Repeat for all embryos. 11. Gently cover the sliced posterior poles with 10 μL of mounting medium, place the coverslip, and seal with nail polish ( Figure 2C ). This volume of mounting medium is appropriate for 22 mm × 22 mm coverslips and needs to be adjusted if other coverslip sizes are used. C. Image acquisition 1. Locate the sliced posterior pole using bright light with the 100× objective. Switch to the fluorescent light mode and center on the germplasm using Osk-bound Star580 signal. 2. Using the STED microscope pilot system Imspector, detect in confocal mode the germ granules (Star 580 signal) and Suntag foci (Star Red signal). Set the excitation laser power (lasers 561 and 640 nm for Star 580 and Star Red, respectively) to reach at least 200 grey levels for Osk staining and 100 grey levels for Suntag staining ( Figure 2D ). Select a region of interest (ROI) of approximately 20 μm × 20 μm at the interface between the germplasm and somatic part of the embryo. 3. Activate the STED depletion laser (775 nm) in Imspector. Both Star 580 and Star Red fluorescent dyes use the same depletion laser wavelength. Depletion laser power is set to get the highest resolution without bleaching the sample, which with our microscope was 30%. Acquire the STED signal for the ROI ( Figure 2D ) and save the image. D. Image processing and analysis 1. Open the acquired raw images with the ImageJ software ( Figure 3A ). 2. On the GFP (Star Red) channel, apply a Gaussian Blur ( Process > Filter > Gaussian Blur radius 0.7 ) to smooth signal intensities ( Figure 3B ). 3. On the Osk (Star 580) channel that shows germ granule biphasic organization, apply a Laplacian of Gaussian filter. This treatment highlights regions of strong intensity change and is used for edge detection. To do that, first apply a Gaussian Blur ( Process > Filter > Gaussian Blur radius 0.7 ) ( Figure 3B ). Then, apply a Laplacian filter ( Process > Filter > Convolve ) ( Figure 3C ). The size of the kernel used in this filter is determined empirically by comparing the treated and raw images, choosing a kernel size that preserves in the treated image the structures observed in the raw image. We used a 15 × 15 kernel with a single point of interest of value 224 and surrounding negative values of -1, as illustrated in Figure 4 . Figure 3. STED image processing and measurement of Suntag foci relative position within germ granule biphasic organization. (A) STED imaging of suntag-nos/+ ; scFv-GFP/+ embryos immunostained with Osk antibody (magenta) and anti-GFP nanobody (green) to reveal scFv-GFP. (B–D) Processing of STED images for the analysis of scFv-GFP foci localization within germ granule biphasic organization. A Gaussian blur is applied to both channels (B) to smooth the signal. Then, a Laplacian filter with a 15 × 15 kernel is applied to the Osk channel to highlight signal edges (C). Both channels are then merged (D). (E–F) Measurement of the relative position of scFv-GFP foci within germ granule biphasic organization. A selection line is drawn on the treated STED image, going across a scFv-GFP foci and granule (E). From the selection, obtain the intensity profile (F) and measure the distance between the peak of scFv-GFP foci and the closest peak for Osk signal measure (a), as well as the full width at half maximum of the selected peak from Osk signal measure (b). The relative position, a/(b/2), has a positive value if the focus is localized outward of the granule (as shown here) and a negative value if the focus is localized inward. (G) Radar chart showing the relative distance of scFv-GFP foci (green dots) within Osk immunostaining (magenta) from images as shown in (E). The granule shell is in pink. (H) Processed STED images showing examples and their corresponding profile plots of the three categories of scFv-GFP localization observed within germ granules: shell (left), periphery (middle), and core (right). Below each profile plot, the measured distances between scFv-GFP and Osk peaks (a), the shell size (b), and the calculated ratio of the relative position of the GFP foci within the granule biphasic organization are indicated. Scale bars: 1 μm in A, D, and E; 0.5 μm in H. Figure 4. Model of a 15 × 15 kernel used for the Laplacian filter 4. Merge the two channels ( Figure 3D ). 5. Manually draw a line across the granule (Osk channel) and Suntag foci (GFP channel) ( Figure 3E ). Record the position of the line in the ROI manager and save all ROIs at the end of the image analysis. 6. Record pixel intensities along the line ( Figure 3F ) using the Fiji Plot profile ( Analyze > Plot Profile ). The Osk signal profile shows a bimodal distribution (two peaks, magenta line in Figure 3F ), while the profile of the Suntag signal (GFP) shows a normal distribution (one peak, green line in Figure 3F ). 7. On the Plot profile, measure the distance between the tip of the GFP signal peak and the closest Osk signal peak (distance a in Figure 3F ), as well as the full width at half maximum of the selected peak from Osk signal (distance b in Figure 3F ), later referred to as shell size.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: • Ramat et al. [5]. Spatial organization of translation and translational repression in two phases of germ granules. Nature Communications ( Figure 2 , panels D–L and Supplementary Figure 3G –M). As described in the research article [10], scFv-GFP foci must be validated as ongoing translation beforehand. First, their colocalization with Suntag mRNA must be evaluated by performing a colocalization assay between smFISH signals against the Suntag sequence and scFv-GFP foci. In addition, the disappearance of scFv-GFP upon translation inhibition (i.e., puromycin treatment) must be performed as seen in Figure 5 . Figure 5. Validation of scFv-GFP foci as translation sites. (A, B) STED imaging of suntag-nos/+ ; scFv-GFP/+ embryos immunostained with Osk antibody (magenta) and anti-GFP nanobody (green) to reveal scFv-GFP in permeabilized embryos without (A) and with (B) puromycin treatment (2 mg/mL for 40 min). Note the absence of GFP foci in the puromycin-treated embryos. Scale bars: 1 μm.",

    "title": "Utilizing FRET-based Biosensors to Measure Cellular Phosphate Levels in Mycorrhizal Roots of Brachypodium distachyon.",
    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi engage in symbiotic relationships with plants, influencing their phosphate (Pi) uptake pathways, metabolism, and root cell physiology. Despite the significant role of Pi, its distribution and response dynamics in mycorrhizal roots remain largely unexplored. While traditional techniques for Pi measurement have shed some light on this, real-time cellular-level monitoring has been a challenge. With the evolution of quantitative imaging with confocal microscopy, particularly the use of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors, live imaging of intracellular Pi concentrations is now achievable. Among these sensors, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors stand out for their accuracy. In this study, we employ the Pi-specific biosensor (cpFLIPPi-5.3m) targeted to the cytosol or plastids of Brachypodium distachyon plants, enabling us to monitor intracellular Pi dynamics during AM symbiosis. A complementary control sensor, cpFLIPPi-Null, is introduced to monitor non-Pi-specific changes. Leveraging a semi-automated ImageJ macro for sensitized FRET analysis, this method provides a precise and efficient way to determine relative intracellular Pi levels at the level of individual cells or organelles. Key features • This protocol describes the use of FRET biosensors for in vivo visualization of spatiotemporal phosphate levels with cellular and subcellular resolution in Brachypodium distachyon. • An optimized growth system can allow tracing of Pi transfer between AM fungi and host root. This protocol is used in: New Phytol (2022), DOI: 10.1111/nph.18081.",
    "methods": "Materials and reagents Biological materials 1. All Brachypodium distachyon (line Bd21-3) transgenic lines used in this protocol can be obtained from Maria Harrison’s lab (under a Boyce Thompson Institute Material Transfer Agreement). The lines are grouped into categories as follows: a. For the quantification of cytosolic Pi levels: Transgenic lines expressing the sensor and its controls from a mycorrhiza-inducible, cell-type-specific promoter, BdPT7. Fluorescent signals from these lines are only from cells containing arbuscules. BdPT7::cpFLIPPi-5.3m BdPT7::cpFLIPPi-Null BdPT7::eCFP BdPT7::cpVenus WT (used as a negative control to remove the potential background during image analysis) All lines are needed for Pi imaging for each experiment. Transgenic lines expressing the sensor and controls from the constitutive promoter ZmUb1 promoter. Fluorescent signals from these lines occur in all cell types. We failed to generate a ZmUb1::cpVenus line so the BdPT7::cpVenus is used as one of the controls for ZmUb1::cpFLIPPi-5.3m. ZmUb1::cpFLIPPi-5.3m ZmUb1::cpFLIPPi-Null ZmUb1::eCFP BdPT7::cpVenus WT (used as a negative control to remove the potential background during image analysis) b. For the quantification of plastidic Pi levels: Transgenic lines expressing a plastid-targeted sensor and its controls from the BdPT7 promoter. Fluorescent signals from these lines occur in the plastid only in cells containing arbuscules. BdPT7::plastid-cpFLIPPi-5.3m BdPT7::plastid-cpFLIPPi-Null BdPT7::plastid-eCFP BdPT7::plastid-cpVenus WT (used as a negative control to remove the potential background during image analysis) 2.

AM fungal spore preparation (optional if inoculating with AM fungi) The preparation of AM fungal spores varies among fungal species and research purposes. If you have an established method, follow it. Otherwise, consider these options: a. Obtain ready-for-use spores from the International Collection of (Vesicular) Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) or commercial vendors like Premier Tech, Canada. b. Refer to spore preparation methods in [26] or [27]. c. In cases when specific fungal species are not required, directly inoculate plants with commercial or home-made mixed propagule inoculum as described in these studies [28,29]. 2. Seed sterilization and plant preparation [30]. Critical: For a complete Pi imaging session, prepare B. distachyon plants expressing the Pi sensor and four controls simultaneously in the same manner. a. Place up to 50 B. distachyon seeds of the same genotype in 14 mL culture tubes. b. Add 10 mL of 20% bleach (v/v) and shake vigorously by hand for 7 min. c. (Under the laminar hood) Decant the bleach and rinse the seeds with sterile deionized water five times. d. Place a sterile germination paper disc in a Petri dish, wet it with sterile deionized water, and place seeds on it (seed embryo facing paper). e. Wrap the Petri dish with Parafilm and aluminum foil and store the seeds in the dark at 4 °C for 1 week. f. After 1 week, move the Petri dish to room temperature for 2 days to stimulate root growth, but leave the seeds in the dark (Petri dish covered with foil is suitable). g. Take the plates out of the dark (remove foil) and place them under light (12:12 h light/dark) for 3–5 days. The light intensity in our chamber was 150 μmol/m 2 ·s. Then, open the plates to harden the seedlings. The B. distachyon seedlings, with a shoot length of approximately 7 cm and a root length of about 5 cm, are now ready for planting and inoculation. 3. AM fungal inoculation setup There are many ways to grow and inoculate B. distachyon plants; here, two types of growth systems are used for the biosensor-based analysis of intracellular Pi in mycorrhizal roots: Preparation of growth system 1: plants in cylinder cones or pots Fill 20 cm long plastic cones or 9 cm diameter pots with growth substrates. For the cone, fill to 5 cm below the top of the cones. For the 9 cm diameter pots, fill the substrate roughly up to half the height of the pot. Note: Choose a suitable growth substrate that allows easy access to clean roots and nutrient management. Substrates or a mixture of substrates such as sand, gravel, and/or turface with particle sizes varying from 0.05 to 0.7 mm are recommended. Avoid vermiculite and perlite as these substrates stick to the surface of the roots, which disturbs imaging. We use gravel and yellow sand in an approximately 1:1 ratio. a. Place the AM fungal spores or the mixed propagule inoculum mixture onto the substrate and then fill the cones or the pots with the same substrate. b. Transplant the B. distachyon seedlings into the substrate. Cover the cones/pots with a plastic dome cover for humidity control ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Demonstration of the growth system 1 c. Place the plants in a growth chamber or a greenhouse under a 12:12 h, 24:22 °C light/dark cycle. The light intensity in our chamber was 150 μmol/m 2 ·s. Grow plants for four weeks watering with deionized water as needed. Fertilize once per week with 10 mL of 1/4 strength modified Hoagland solution containing 20 μM potassium phosphate (or as needed depending on the growth substrate used). Note: High Pi levels in the fertilizer may inhibit fungal colonization of the host roots. d. One day before imaging, provide plants with 10 mL of 1/4 strength modified Hoagland solution supplemented with 2 μM potassium phosphate (generating a lower Pi environment). Preparation of growth system 2: plants inoculated between cellulose membranes a. Sandwich a seedling and some fungal spores between two pieces of MF Millipore membrane filter discs. Position the spores around the root ( Figure 2A ). Figure 2. Demonstration of the growth system 2. A. A Gigaspora gigantea spore placed next to the seedling during the system setup. B. Agar blocks placed onto the fungal hyphae to start localized treatment. b. Place the sandwich with plants and spores vertically in the earlier discussed sand/gravel mix in a 9 cm diameter pot. c. Set the plants in the same growth condition as described in step c in the section “Preparation of growth system 1”. B. Preparation of B. distachyon roots for Pi imaging Note: This procedure is tailored for Pi imaging using an upright microscope. If an inverted microscope is used, adjustments will be needed. Growth system 1 1. Carefully remove the plants from the cones and place the root in a large Petri dish (14 cm diameter). 2. Rinse the roots gently with running water to remove substrates. 3. Immerse the roots in the container with 1/4× modified Hoagland solution with 2 μM potassium phosphate (the same Pi concentration as the final fertilizer treatment as reported in step d in the section “Preparation of growth system 1”). Critical: To minimize the intracellular Pi disturbance due to manipulation, ensure the Pi concentration in the container matches the solution last used to maintain the plants unless another treatment is required. 4. Use a fluorescence stereomicroscope to locate a colonized root. Note: While checking the root under the microscope, use tweezers to isolate a single root branch and gently slide it onto the glass slide. 5. Transfer the root region to the center of a microscope slide (ideally 75 mm × 25 mm). Cover it with a coverslip (ideally 20 mm × 20 mm) to maintain stability and flatness during imaging ( Figure 3 ). If necessary, add a few drops of the 1/4 modified Hoagland solution with 2 μM potassium phosphate on the side of the coverslip. Note: If AM fungal colonization is not required, omit steps B4 and B5, directly place a root region of interest onto the microscope slide, and cover it with a coverslip as described. Figure 3. Arrangement of the root on the glass slide for confocal imaging 6. Gather the rest of the attached root and shoot around the edge of the coverslip (some may hang outside the slide). 7. Frequently spray the root and shoot with 1/4 modified Hoagland solution with 2 μM potassium phosphate to maintain moisture. Growth system 2 This growth system allows a local application of Pi or chemical treatment directly to mycorrhizal roots or their connected extraradical hyphae of the fungi. The treatment is applied via solid agar blocks. Below is an example of using the system to provide a local Pi treatment of 200 μM Pi. 1. Prepare a 1/4× modified Hoagland solution containing 200 μM Pi and 1% (w/v) agar immediately before the experiment. Agar is dissolved by heating in a microwave. Note: Sterile Hoagland solution is recommended to avoid contamination. 2. Pipette the solution into a Petri dish in 10 μL droplets and allow them to solidify. 3. Gently remove the MF Millipore membrane with the plant from the pots and place it in a ~20 cm diameter flat-bottomed container. 4. Carefully remove one MF Millipore membrane and expose the roots and fungus. Gently remove the substrates on the membrane. Critical: Some roots grow into or through the MF Millipore membrane. Make sure the removal process does not break the roots. 5. Locate the colonized root regions and their connecting fungal hyphae. If using non-colonized roots, locate and mark the root regions of interest. Mark the site for applying the agar blocks and take photographs with distance scales for reference. 6. Place the solidified agar blocks over the roots or the extraradical hyphae at the marked sites ( Figure 2B ). If incubation is needed, place the membrane with the plant inside a closed container, ensuring that the shoot remains outside of the container. For example, use a 14 cm Petri dish with one side removed. The shoot can be left outside. Periodically spray the membrane with 1/4 modified solution without Pi to maintain a moist environment. The system can be left in the dark or light as needed. When applying a localized treatment to the extraradical hyphae, it may be useful to have a Benomyl-treated control. Benomyl is a fungicide, and fungal activity can be abolished by applying 1 mL of 100 μg/μL Benomyl to the mycorrhizal root system one day before the experiment (as used in [22]). This Benomyl-treated control enables an assessment of diffusion along the hyphae vs. active transport by the fungus. 7. Remove the agar blocks after 24 h of incubation. If imaging is required after the treatment, transfer the membrane with the plant onto a glass slide (ideally 75 mm × 25 mm), ensuring that the marked region is at the center of the slide. 8. Place a coverslip (ideally 20 mm × 20 mm) over the region of interest on the membrane. If necessary, add a few drops of the 1/4 modified Hoagland solution without phosphate on the side of the coverslip. Frequently spray the membrane with Hoagland solution without phosphate to maintain moisture throughout the procedure. C. Confocal imaging of roots Critical: See General note 1 to determine how to set the confocal settings. 1. Once confocal settings are finalized, begin imaging roots expressing either the Pi or control biosensor. Each image set should include CC (CFP excitation—CFP emission), CY (CFP excitation—YFP emission), and YY (YFP excitation—YFP emission) images. For roots generated using growth system 2, position the glass slides with the membrane directly on the microscope stage. When imaging a colonized root, ensure that the images capture the targeted arbuscules and that the arbuscules are distinct. Note: Aim for a minimum of six biological replicates (individual roots) in each treatment group to ensure robust statistical analysis. Ideally, obtain at least five clear images showcasing at least five arbuscules in the desired colonized region for each root. Critical: To ensure integration with our FLIPPi image analysis macro in ImageJ, maintain specific image file names when saving image files. The suggested file naming system is pPT7_cytFLIPPi_053019_HP_0.5h_102 (sensor name) (date) (group) (plant & image number) You can adjust the name and order of components, such as the line name, date, and treatment group, as needed. However, the plant and image number “_102” format must be retained. In this format, “1” signifies the first root, while “2” indicates it is the second image of that root. For instance, for the 10th image of root 6, the plant and image number would be “_610.” This format provides a unique identifier, allowing the FLIPPi macro to distinguish individual images from each plant. 2. After imaging all samples with the Pi and control biosensors, proceed to image the roots expressing eCFP and cpVenus. Each set of images should contain all CC, CY, and YY images. Note: At least three biological replicates are recommended for eCFP and cpVenus, capturing a minimum of five distinct images per replicate. D. Image processing and sensitized FRET analysis Sensitized FRET ratios eliminate non-FRET emissions such as CFP bleed-through and YFP (or cpVenus) cross-excitation. Each image requires standard processing. The sensitized FRET analysis can be conducted for each image set (CC, CY, and YY). For efficiency, utilize the FLIPPi macro, which is designed primarily for images from Leica confocal microscopes. For other confocal types, adjust file names to fit the macro as suggested in step C1. Once the folders are directed to the FLIPPi macro, it automatically processes images and calculates CC, CY, and YY values after selecting the regions of interest (ROIs) ( Figure 4 ). Usually, up to five ROIs can be selected per image. Note: The macro is compatible with both MacOS and Microsoft operating systems. Figure 4. Screenshot showcasing a sample folder with FRET images, adhering to the suggested file naming system 1. Open Fiji, find Plugins menu, go to Macros → Startup Macro . A window ( Figure 5 ) will show up. Figure 5. Screenshot showing the window following the selection of the Startup Macro option 2. Remove the green script as they are the default description from Fiji. Insert the command lines from Method S1 in [22]. Click Run . A subsequent window ( Figure 6 ) will appear. Figure 6. Screenshot showing the window following clicking Run 3. Keep the “File Name [Blank]” at its default setting. Choose one of the four functions: Series Analyzer, Reverse Series Analyzer, ROI Analyzer , or Reverse ROI Analyzer . The functionalities of these options are detailed below: • Series Analyzer: This function aids in background removal. It generates a mask image that captures only the root, excluding the background. This is based on the root’s profile on CC, as these images clearly depict the root profile. Subsequently, this mask is applied to the CC, CY, and YY to remove their backgrounds. The processed images are exported into the same folder as the original images. • Reverse Series Analyzer: This operates similarly to the Series Analyzer, but with one distinction. It employs YY to create mask images instead of CC. This is specifically useful for background removal in a control set of images from cpVenus because the fluorescence intensity of CC is not high enough for mask creation. • ROI Analyzer: After opening the processed CC created by the Series Analyzer, this function prompts users to select their regions of interest (ROIs). It then calculates the mean grey values of these ROIs from the CC, CY, and YY images. The resultant data is in tabular form, ready to be transferred into Excel. • Reverse ROI Analyzer: Serving a similar purpose to the ROI Analyzer, this function is specifically tailored for images from the cpVenus control. It begins by opening the processed YY in lieu of the CC. 4. Begin with unprocessed images exported from the imaging software. Select Series Analyzer and click OK . This action will prompt a file directory window to appear ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7. Screenshot showing the file directory window after step D4 Critical: Ensure that the images exported are in TIFF format. Each set of images, originating from a single ROI, should be separated into three grayscale images: CC, CY, and YY, which are categorized based on the emission collection channels. It is important that you do not use RGB format during image processing. As specified in the macro scripts (refer to Method S1 in [22]), CC is linked to channel 00 (file names conclude with “_ch00” by Leica LAS X), CY is associated with channel 01 (indicated by “_ch01”), and YY corresponds to channel 03 (“_ch03”). The macro scripts can be tailored to various naming systems. Critical: see General note 2. 5. Select the folder that contains your original images and click Open . All images within this folder will be automatically opened, processed, and saved back to the same location. 6. Once processing is complete, navigate to the chosen folder. Transfer the processed images to the designated “processed image” folder. You can identify the processed images by their file name endings: “-m.tif” for mask images and “-result.tif” for fully processed images. Sort the files by their date modified; all processed images are placed together ( Figure 8 ). Figure 8. Screenshot showing the file directory window for step D6. Processed images end their file names with “-result.tif” or “-m.tif.” 7. Run the macro again, select ROI Analyzer , and click OK . 8. Similar to the Series Analyzer, the ROI Analyzer will sequentially open each image based on the file order in the folder. An image window will appear, accompanied by a prompt asking, “How many ROI’s would you like to use?” ( Figure 9 ). Figure 9. Screenshot showing the prompted windows for step D8 9. Depending on the number of visualized colonized cells, typically 1–5 ROIs are chosen for each image. If an image should be bypassed, enter “0” and click OK . Note: Adjust the brightness and contrast of the images by navigating to Image → Adjust → Brightness/Contrast… This will enhance the visibility of the ROI without altering the grayscale value of each pixel. 10. Select the Oval Tool from the taskbar and begin designating oval ROIs. Each ROI should be positioned entirely within one cell. Choose an area where the signal is bright but not saturated. Once you have chosen the ROI, click OK in the pop-up Waiting window ( Figure 10 ). Critical: To generate accurate data, it is essential to maintain a consistent ROI size. A Result window will appear, displaying the CC, CY, and YY values. Gather these results once the ROIs from all images in the folder have been selected. Figure 10. Screenshot showing the prompted windows for step D10 11. A subsequent Waiting window will emerge for the next ROI. Simply reposition the circle to another colonized cell in focus and continue the process. The macro will proceed to the next image once the designated number of ROIs has been selected from the current image. Critical: Ensure that the ROI is selected prior to clicking OK . Failing to do so may cause the program to freeze, requiring a restart from the beginning. 12. Once the ROI Analyzer has completed analyzing all processed images in the folder ( Figure 11 ), copy the results and paste them into the Excel template (refer to Table S4 in [22]). Close the Results window. Figure 11. Screenshot showing the prompted windows for step D13 13. Continue the analysis for all the roots associated with FLIPPi, control sensors, and the eCFP control. 14. For roots associated with cpVenus, utilize the Reverse Series Analyzer and Reverse ROI Analyzer. The steps for using the Reverse Series Analyzer and Reverse ROI Analyzer mirror those of the Series Analyzer and ROI Analyzer, respectively. 15. Arrange the data within the Excel sheet template (refer to Table S4 in [22]). This template offers a structure where different treatment groups have individual tabs. Inside each tab, data are organized according to the sensor type. The columns labeled “Plant, CC, CY, and YY” are directly derived from the FIJI macro. 16. For CFP controls, transfer the columns titled “Plant,” “CC,” and “CY” to Excel. For cpVenus controls, transfer the columns “Plant,” “CY,” and “YY” to Excel.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: • Zhang et al.

    "title": "Automated Layer Analysis (ALAn): An Image Analysis Tool for the Unbiased Characterization of Mammalian Epithelial Architecture in Culture.",
    "abstract": "Cultured mammalian cells are a common model system for the study of epithelial biology and mechanics. Epithelia are often considered as pseudo-two dimensional and thus imaged and analyzed with respect to the apical tissue surface. We found that the three-dimensional architecture of epithelial monolayers can vary widely even within small culture wells, and that layers that appear organized in the plane of the tissue can show gross disorganization in the apical-basal plane. Epithelial cell shapes should be analyzed in 3D to understand the architecture and maturity of the cultured tissue to accurately compare between experiments. Here, we present a detailed protocol for the use of our image analysis pipeline, Automated Layer Analysis (ALAn), developed to quantitatively characterize the architecture of cultured epithelial layers. ALAn is based on a set of rules that are applied to the spatial distributions of DNA and actin signals in the apical-basal (depth) dimension of cultured layers obtained from imaging cultured cell layers using a confocal microscope. ALAn facilitates reproducibility across experiments, investigations, and labs, providing users with quantitative, unbiased characterization of epithelial architecture and maturity. Key features • This protocol was developed to spatially analyze epithelial monolayers in an automated and unbiased fashion. • ALAn requires two inputs: the spatial distributions of nuclei and actin in cultured cells obtained using confocal fluorescence microscopy. • ALAn code is written in Python3 using the Jupyter Notebook interactive format. • Optimized for use in Marbin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and successfully applied to characterize human MCF-7 mammary gland-derived and Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells. • This protocol utilizes Imaris software to segment nuclei but may be adapted for an alternative method. ALAn requires the centroid coordinates and volume of nuclei.",

After the desired period of culture time, remove the culture media and wash cells once with 250 μL of dPBS. Add 200 μL of a solution of 3.7% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS with 2% Tween 20 to the well and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Wash the cells three times with 250 μL of PBS with 0.2% Tween 20, letting the wash solution sit in each well for 10 min between washing steps. Dilute fluorescein phalloidin 1:500 in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 and add 250 μL to each well. Incubate for 12–24 h at 4 °C. Remove phalloidin solution and rinse with PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 three times. Add approximately 500 μL (or at least enough to fully cover the cell layer) of Vectashield with DAPI to the well. Confocal imaging Cells can be imaged directly in the Ibidi wells through the #1.5 polymer coverslip bottom using an inverted confocal microscope. Image a region in XY with an area of at least 60 μm × 60 μm at Nyquist resolution at a minimum of 512 × 512 pixels. Image actin stained by FITC-conjugated phalloidin using the 488 nm line and DNA stained by DAPI using the 405 nm line. Use standard imaging techniques to set acquisition parameters to ensure that you are taking advantage of the full dynamic imaging range and not saturating pixels. Note: Any saturation will invalidate the use of ALAn. Take confocal z-stacks at a spacing of no greater than 0.5 μm, preferably Nyquist sampling (select Auto step size in the Z-scan settings in Fusion), starting from beneath the bottom of the chamber slide where no actin (FITC) signal can be detected and ending above the layer where no more actin signal can be detected. Preparation of data for input into ALAn Segmentation of nuclei using Imaris Save files using the following name format: “Identfier1_Identifier2_Identifier3_Identifier4.ims” where the identifiers are the experimental parameters that you would like to log (for example, “MDCKcells_GeneKnockOut1_PlatingDensity100k_48hrsGrowth.ims”). Load the files to be analyzed into the Imaris arena using the Observe Path function. Select the image to be analyzed and open in the Surpass view. Go to the 3D View menu and select Cells . Select the Add new Cells function to begin segmentation. Use the default settings to segment nuclei and cell borders (although we will skip the cell borders segmentation) and deselect Segment only a Region of Interest . Use the blue arrow to move to nuclei detection. Do not use the green arrow. Set your source channel to the DNA-stained channel (DAPI-stained 405 channel using the above protocol). Set the expected nucleus diameter based on the cell types. (For MDCK cells, we suggest a value of 7.3 μm.) Ensure that the smooth feature is auto selected and set to a width of 1/10 th of the nucleus diameter. Select Split Nuclei by Seed Points . Use the blue arrow to move to Filter Nuclei Seed Points. Set the minimum Quality factor to 4. Note: This value is set to be relatively low because, at this stage of the segmentation process, it is best to find as many nuclei as possible. It is easy to remove nuclei in ALAn, but impossible to add more. Use the blue arrow to move to Nuclei Threshold. Set the “Nuclei Threshold (absolute intensity)” to a value that accurately segments the nuclei in the interactive view ( Figure 2A ). (Check to ensure that this value does not include the peak on the histogram that corresponds to the background signal peak. If it does, then adjust the threshold up until it is past the peak.) Use the blue arrow to move to Filter Nuclei. When the Thresholding ends, click the orange X. Do not do any further filtering at this point unless you disagree with the segmentation. Save the segmented summary statistics by first selecting the Statistics option and then selecting the Export All Statistics to File option. It is helpful to save all Imaris segmentation files in one directory, separate from the original .ims image files. The Imaris output creates a folder of files that contain the positional and volumetric information of segmented nuclei. Download Collation_Imaris2ALAn.ipynb from the Bergstralh lab GitHub. This data will convert the Imaris statistics into .csv data files that can be read into ALAn. Open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda navigator. This will open Jupyter Notebook in a new browser window of your default browser. A navigation menu of the files on your computer is shown. Navigate to the location of the “Collation_Imaris2ALAn.ipynb” file on your computer and open this Notebook ( Figure 2B ). Run the code in Jupyter Notebook cell 2, which imports the necessary Python packages. Define the input directory path, where the Imaris Statistics files are located, on Jupyter Notebook cell 3, line 6. Define the output directory name on Jupyter Notebook cell 3, line 11, and the directory location of this directory on Jupyter Notebook cell 3, line 14. This will be the location where .csv files containing the necessary nuclei positions will be saved. Run through all code in the “Collation_Imaris2ALAn” file. Required data if you segment nuclei using a method not using Imaris as described in Section 1 Segment nuclear positions and extract information about the volume and centroid of nuclei in the image file. Generate a .csv file with four columns. Column 1: X coordinate of nucleus center; Column 2: Y coordinate of nucleus center; Column 3: Z coordinate of nucleus center; Column 4: Volume of Nucleus. Rows correspond to each segmented nucleus. Add heading titles to row 1. A1 = Nucleus Position X; B1 = Nucleus Position Y; C1 = Nucleus Position Z; D1 = Nucleus Volume. Figure 2. Screenshots showing key steps from the protocol. A. Screenshot from Imaris showing the nuclear segmentation step. Users must choose a nucleus threshold value such that nuclei are accurately segmented and segmented seeds are not touching where possible. B and C. Screenshots of Jupyter Notebook showing open Collation_Imaris2AlAn (B) and ALAn_v3 code (C). Scale XY confocal slices to 512 × 512 pixels. This can be done in Imaris in the Edit menu by selecting Resample 3D and resizing the X and Y values as 512. Make sure to select Fixed Ratio X/Y , not Fixed Ratio X/Y/Z . Determine the spatial bounds of the image. Open the original image file using FIJI. Select Show Info from the Image menu. Identify the X, Y, and Z spatial bounds of the image file in the Show Info panel values ExtMax0 through ExtMin2. ExtMax0 =X max; ExtMax1 = Y max; ExtMax2 = Z max; ExtMin0 = X min; ExtMin1 = Y min; ExtMin2 = Z min. Open the .csv file containing the segmented nuclei positions using Microsoft Excel. Name column E “Positions.” Paste values ExtMax0 through ExtMin2 into Excel notebook cells E2–E7. Save confocal stacks as .tiff files in the same folder as the corresponding .csv files containing the nuclei segmentation information. This can be done by opening proprietary file images in FIJI and Selecting Save as > Tiff in the File menu. Ensure that the corresponding .csv files containing the nuclear and layer positional information and the .tiff files containing the confocal stack images have the same name . ALAn will read both files and perform an analysis of these partner files. Use ALAn to batch process and analyze data Download “ALAn_v3.ipynb” from the Bergstralh lab GitHub. This is the main data analysis code. Open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda navigator. This will open Jupyter Notebook in a new browser window of your default browser. A navigation menu of the files on your computer is shown. Navigate to the location of the “ALAn_v3.ipynb” file on your computer and open this Notebook ( Figure 2C ). Run the code in Jupyter Notebook cell 2, which imports the necessary Python packages. Change the code on Jupyter Notebook cell 3, line 7 to the path where your input partner .csv and .tiff files are located. Run the code in Jupyter Notebook cell 3. The data will be imported into two lists. All of the information in the .csv files will be converted into a list of pandas DataFrames (list_of_dfs), and all .tiffs will be read in as a list of 4D numpy arrays (list_of_unshuffled_images). Any .tiff or .csv file that does not have a partner file with the same name will not be added to these lists. A third list (list_of_names) will be generated to keep track of which image name is stored in each of the elements. Check that the file names, number of input images, and dimensions of the three lists are the same, as shown in the output text below the Jupyter Notebook cell. Run the code in Jupyter Notebook cell 4. This will load all of the functions of ALAn. Note: A description of each function and a description of its inputs and outputs are in the README.md file on the Bergstralh-Lab/ALAn GitHub page. Change the input parameters of the batch_process function on code line Jupyter Notebook cell 5, line 2. First, define the channel that represents the image actin signal in the .tiff file (this can be determined by opening the .tiff in FIJI) (0 = first channel, 1 = second channel, etc.). Second, change the name that you would like to save your output .csv file as. Run the code in Jupyter Notebook cell 5. This will process all of the input images as a batch. A timer will output the time taken to run this function. Open the output .csv file, which has the name as defined on Jupyter Notebook cell 5, line 4 as the last parameter of the batch_process function. The directory will be the same as your input files. Check that a valid output has been generated. The basic outputs of ALAn are: Column A: Element number used by ALAn for each input. Column B: Root name of input .tiff and .csv files. Column C: Layer determination; ALAn makes a categorization of the layer into the following categories: Disorganized, Immature, Intermediate A, Intermediate B, and Mature. For a full explanation of these categories see Dawney et al. [1] and Cammarota et al. [2]. Column D: Number of cells identified in the basal tissue layer. Column E: Number of cells identified above the basal tissue layer. Column F: Total number of cells (sum of columns D and E). Column G: Cell density of identified tissue layer per unit culture area. Column H: Height of identified tissue layer. Column I: Percentage of total cells above the layer. Column J: Average area of cells in the plane of the tissue. Column K: Average cell perimeter in the plane of the tissue. Column L: Average cell circularity in the plane of the tissue. Use of ALAn to make diagnostic/informative plots and visuals For any dataset, the functions of ALAn can be used to generate diagnostic and data outputs and figures. Here, we provide a protocol for running the functions that provide the most informative figure outputs for the analysis of the data. An optional input of save_name = “string” allows you to save this plot as a .pdf. Figures should be generated in an embedded figure in the Jupyter Notebook (defined by code on Jupyter Notebook cell 2, line 16: “%matplotlib notebook”). Determine the element number for the dataset of interest from the output .csv file of the batch_process function. In a new Jupyter Notebook cell, define your dataset of interest by typing “I = n’ where n is the element number of your chosen dataset. In any subsequent Jupyter Notebook cell, you can run the clear_debris function by typing “clear_debris(list_of_dfs[i], plot = True)” and run the Jupyter Notebook cell. This function provides data on which objects identified by the nuclear segmentation input are considered as real cells and used for analysis. A histogram showing the distribution of nuclear volumes in μm 3 (X-axis) against the frequency of these volumes is output ( Figure 3A ). The objects discarded as debris are shown in blue, and the nuclei identified as valid are orange. A pandas DataFrame containing the nuclei identified as true datapoints is output (df_cleared) and printed below the figure. In any subsequent Jupyter Notebook cell, you can run the nuclear_centroid_actin_overlay function by typing “nuclear_centroid_actin_overlay(list_of_dfs[i], list_of_unshuffled_images[i]).” Use this function to test the input nuclear segmentation and clear_debris functions to ensure that the nuclei used by ALAn are reasonable. A figure is generated in the Notebook showing the nuclear centroid positions in the tissue plane are overlayed with the actin channel to view the position of nuclei within each cell ( Figure 3B ). Black dots indicate real nuclei and red dots indicate false nuclei as defined by clear_debris. If you are not happy with the cutoff volume of real nuclei, you can change the value that is used to define what a real nucleus is in the clear_debris function. This is currently set to 1.5 standard deviations below the average nuclear volume (defined on Jupyter Notebook cell 4, line 97). In any subsequent Jupyter Notebook cell, you can run the nuclei_distribution function by typing “nuclei_distribution(list_of_dfs[i], list_of_unshuffled_images[i], plot = True).” This function determines if the layer is organized into a monolayer or not and returns a classification as Organized or Disorganized. A plot showing the projected number of nuclei and actin intensity (double Y-axis) across the depth of the layer, Z position in µm (X-axis) is generated in the Notebook ( Figure 3C ). This is a useful figure to interrogate the organization of cells across the depth of the tissue. In any subsequent Jupyter Notebook cell, you can run the find_shoulders function ( Figure 1D ) by typing “find_shoulders(list_of_dfs[i], list_of_unshuffled_images[i], plot = True).” This function determines whether the plot of actin intensity across the depth of the tissue has a shoulder. The output is a plot of actin intensity and the first derivative of the actin profile (double Y-axis) against the depth of tissue, Z position (µm) (X-axis). These plots are used to identify the correct subcategory of organized in terms of the developmental series of epithelialization . Immature layers are defined by two rules that do not pertain to this function; all other organized layers are identified by this function. Intermediate A layers have a one-peaked actin intensity derivative. Intermediate B and Mature layers have a two-peaked actin intensity derivative. By taking the ratio between the height of the apical peak to the lateral peak, we identify the difference between the two layer types. A ratio of less than one is classified as an Intermediate B layer, while a ratio of greater than one is classified as a Mature layer. Figure 3. Diagnostic and informative plots generated by Automated Layer Analysis (ALAn). A. The clear_debris function outputs a histogram showing the frequency of segmented objects with respect to their volume that was input into ALAn. The orange bars represent nuclei identified as real and the blue bars represent debris that is removed from the analysis. A dotted line indicates the threshold volume above which a nucleus is considered real. B. The nuclear_centroid_actin_overlay function outputs an image that displays the centroid position of the segmented nuclei overlaid onto the .tiff image of the actin signal projected on the XY plane of the tissue. C. The nuclei_distribution function outputs a plot showing both the projected signal of actin (red) and the nuclear distribution (blue), fit with a Gaussian, with respect to the depth of the tissue. The tissue layer top, bottom, and peak position of the actin signal are shown by dotted lines. D. The find_shoulders function outputs a plot of the actin signal (red) and the first derivative of this plot (blue) with respect to the tissue depth. The tissue layer top, bottom, and peak position of the actin signal are shown by dotted lines. E. The terrain_map function outputs a map of the position of the centroids of nuclei projected onto the XY plane of the tissue, displayed as dots. The size of the dots shows relative volumes of nuclei. The color of the dots represents the relative positions of the nuclei with respect to the depth of the tissue. The color scale goes from light orange (most basal) to purple (most apical). F. The sub_classify function outputs a map representing the XY field of view of the input 512 × 512 pixel .tiffs broken into 100 × 100 pixel sections, color-coded by the layer category as determined by the original version of ALAn. “lawngreen” = Immature, “forestgreen” = Intermediate A, “darkturquoise” = Intermediate B, “steelblue” = Mature, “orange” = Disorganized. In any subsequent Jupyter Notebook cell, you can run the terrain_map function ( Figure 3E ) by typing “terrain_map(list_of_dfs[i], list_of_unshuffled_images[i]).” This function plots all of the nuclei in a confocal stack on the XY plane, positioned by their XY position, sized based on nuclear size, and colored based on the z-position of the nucleus ( Figure 3E ). This allows for the visualization of the position of extra layer cells or disorganized regions within the field of view. In any subsequent Jupyter Notebook cell, you can run the sub_classify function ( Figure 3F ) by typing “sub_classify(list_of_dfs[i], list_of_unshuffled_images[i], plot = True).” This function breaks the full XY field of view into the smallest classifiable sections (100 px × 100 px) and outputs an ALAn classification of each of the subsections all_sections_analyzed list. This function outputs a figure showing the full field of view divided into a grid of 25 squares colored by layer type ( Figure 3F ). In any subsequent Jupyter Notebook cell, you can run the xy_segmentation function by typing “xy_segmentation(list_of_dfs[i], list_of_unshuffled_images[i], plot = True).” This only works for Organized layer types. This function segments the basal actin of the underlying organized cell layer in the plane of the tissue to output shape parameters of cells in the plane of the tissue. This function uses region_props from the scikit-image package to extract shape parameters. The function will output four figures showing the stages of segmentation as compared to the projected actin signal. This output is useful to check that the actin signal has been correctly segmented for in-plane cell shape analysis. This function will output images for Disorganized layers if prompted, though results will be uninterpretable, so avoid running this function on a Disorganized layer.\n\nValidation of protocol This work was developed to investigate the effects of cell plating density and time and characterize the architectural development of MDCK monolayers in publications [1] and [2]. We developed an unbiased and thorough imaging strategy to image a comprehensive map of epithelial architecture, imaging the same 16 representative 300 × 300 μm regions from the 1 mm2 wells. We developed ALAn using a dataset of over 19,000 cells across 351 imaged regions from four repeats of three plating densities and two repeats of the 16 regions. We further validated our strategy and broad application of the tool to analyze epithelial architecture using Caco-2 and MCF-7 cells as shown in Dawney et al. [1], Figure S4.",

    "abstract": "Successful advancement in the treatment of diabetes mellitus is not possible without well-established methodology for beta cell mass calculation. Here, we offer the protocol to assess beta cell mass during embryonic development in the mouse. The described protocol has detailed steps on how to process extremely small embryonic pancreatic tissue, cut it on the cryostat, and stain tissue slides for microscopic analysis. The method does not require usage of confocal microscopy and takes advantage of enhanced automated image analysis with proprietary as well as open-source software packages.",

For example, if 5 male mice will be used for breeding at a given night, then 10 male mice should be set up. Let the animals rest for one night. At the end of the day (approximately between 4:00 and 6:00 PM), place one female mouse with each individual male and leave the remaining half of single-housed male mice alone. Next morning, check each female mouse for the presence of a vaginal plug ( Figure 1 ), which suggests successful breeding. Tag the plugged female mice, measure their body weight, and place them in a new cage. This day is referred to as E0.5. Make appropriate notes in your notebook or on the computer, including the mouse number and the day when the vaginal plug was confirmed, as well as the body weight of the mouse at the day of the vaginal plugging. Figure 1. Vaginal plug (indicated by an orange arrow) during morning assessment after overnight breeding of Balb/c female mouse Repeat breeding with the second half of males during following night. Let the first half of males, which were used during the first night of breeding, to rest. Continue this mating strategy until all desired females are plugged. In order to facilitate execution of experimental design for specific embryonic days and correctly predict experimental needs utilizing a timed-pregnancy model, we created a dedicated MS Excel program ( YKTPPaL.xsls ). At 10 days after E0.5, check the body weight of female mice. An increase by more than 2 g strongly suggests pregnancy (accordingly, the age of embryos is considered E10.5 at this stage) ( Heyne et al., 2015 ). Apply any experimental and control treatment, as originally designed. Alternatively, the treatments can be initiated at E0.5, although this approach requires additional mice as not all plugged female mice become pregnant. Tissue processing and freezing Euthanize pregnant mice according to the IACUC approved protocol. Prepare ice bucket with the following Petri dishes ( Figure 2 ): One dish with PBS for initial placement of embryos One dish with PBS for individually separated embryos Two dishes with PBS for pancreatic tissue isolation from each embryo being processed One or more Petri dish lids for tissue processing ( Figure 3 ) Figure 2. Preparation for embryonic pancreas isolation Figure 3. The processing steps of embryonic pancreatic tissue, E12.5 (indicated by orange arrows) Harvest pancreatic tissue as desired (e.g., at E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5) ( Video 1 ). If experimental design and conditions permit, it is better to euthanize only one pregnant mouse at a time and process its litter. Proceed then with euthanasia of the next pregnant mouse and processing of its litter. With good skills, each pancreatic sample can be consistently obtained within 2–4 min. Specifically, we were successful with up to two litters at the same time. Video 1. Dissecting technique of developing pancreatic tissue during mouse embryogenesis Outline with Pap-pen three circles per pancreatic rudiment as needed on Petri dish lids and fill them up with PBS, 2% PFA, and 30% sucrose, respectively. Gently, place each isolated pancreatic tissue in a circle with PBS ( Figure 3 ). This step can be simplified by pulling pancreatic rudiments from the same experimental group into one processing circle. For example, pancreatic rudiments at E12.5 treated with control/vehicle can be placed into one processing circle, as long as it is the only parameter being assessed during the study. If each pancreatic rudiment has its own unique features, e.g., genotype, type of treatment, gender, etc., then they should be placed into individual processing circles. With the help of dissecting microscope and 1 cc syringe with 30 G needle, transfer isolated samples into the PAP-pen circles containing 2% PFA for 2–4 h at room temperature (RT). Next, transfer samples into the last circle with 30% sucrose until they sink down to the bottom of solution ( Video 2 ). Video 2. Embryonic pancreatic tissue explant processing technique for cryopreservation Prepare Tissue-Tek biopsy cryomolds: label molds with chemically resistant marker and tape with clear tape over marker writing. Fill up the molds with OCT compound. Using the syringe with 30 G angled or straight needle, transfer samples from sucrose circle into the mold with OCT under the dissecting microscope. Position the sample in the middle depth of the mold. Repeat it for all samples. Crush dry ice with mortar and pestle into very small pieces and transfer it into a borosilicate container filled up with 100% ethanol, to make freezing solution. Quickly, under the dissecting microscope and using syringe with 30 G needle, push pancreatic sample to the bottom of the mold, making sure the tissue is oriented in the middle of the most bottom area ( Figure 4 ). Place the mold on top of the dry ice/ethanol bath for freezing. Repeat freezing procedure for all samples as quickly as possible. Figure 4. Placement of embryonic pancreatic tissue E16.5 in the cryomold Tissue cutting Since embryonic pancreatic rudiments (especially at E12.5–E14.5) are very tiny, it is important to freeze them in the middle of the most bottom area of cryomold. This approach will make tissue visible as a brown-to-yellow dot and facilitate its finding for cutting on cryostat. For a backup, each slide should be cut in duplicate. All tissue levels obtained from a single pancreatic rudiment should be positioned in sequential order on 1–2 slides. The thickness of sections should be 5 μm. First tissue section is referred to as level one (e.g., level 1 section 1) and should be placed on the first slide in the top left corner, allowing a reasonable distance to the edge of the slide. The very next pancreatic section is referred to as a duplicate section of the first layer (e.g., level 1 section 2) and should be placed in the same spot of duplicate slide. Repeat this cutting technic until all pancreatic tissue is cut through. Using the above-described approach, E12.5 pancreatic section levels are spaced approximately 15 μm apart. For level separation of larger embryonic pancreatic tissue, make an additional seven (E14.5) or ten (E16.5) cuts (5 μm each) into waste to space adjacent levels to 35 and 50 μm apart, respectively. The total level output may vary and be dependent on treatment and genotype. On average, expect 10–14 tissue levels per single pancreatic bud ( Table 1 and Figure 5 ). Table 1.

E14.5 Embryonic pancreas sections (outlined with orange rectangles) from level 1 through 13 (left to right, top to bottom) on a slide Note that depending on experimental needs, it is possible to prepare additional backup slides of pancreatic tissue starting at E14.5. Accordingly, the number of 5 μm cuts to be skipped into waste should be decreased ( Table 2 ). Table 2.

Slides can be stored for up to four years. IF staining De-freeze and dry slides at RT. Keep duplicate slides frozen as backup. Outline a big circle around all tissue sections on each slide with PAP-pen. Add 5% BSA dropwise on a slide to cover tissue sections. Incubate 30–60 min at RT in moisturized IF staining tray. Prepare working dilution of mouse anti-insulin Alexa-647 antibody in 5% BSA (the dilution factor will depend on the microscope and lot of the antibody). If needed, you can combine this antibody with anti-glucagon Alexa-594 and anti-somatostatin Alexa-488 antibodies. For example, we successfully used a combination of anti-insulin Alexa-647 (1:500), anti-glucagon Alexa-594 (1:1,000), and anti-somatostatin Alexa-488 (1:200) Abs together in a single-step staining procedure ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6. 23P pancreas section stained simultaneously with antibodies to insulin (Alexa-647, red), glucagon (Alexa-594, purple), and somatostatin (Alexa-488, green). 20× magnification. Scale bar, 50 μm. Remove excess BSA solution from slide by blotting the edge of the slide against paper towel and add 100 μL of Abs working solution on each slide. Cover moisturized staining tray with a lid and incubate in dark at 4 °C overnight. The following morning, remove excess of staining solution from the slide by blotting the edge of the slide against paper towel, and place the slide in a Coplin jar with PBS for 5 min. Remove excess of PBS solution and repeat washing step one more time. Place two coverslips on a paper towel and add one bubble-free drop of mounting media with DAPI in the center of the coverslip. Take the slide out from washing Coplin jar, blot its edge against paper towel, quickly swing it in the air to remove residual PBS and, with tissue sections facing down, put it on a coverslip with DAPI mounting media. Repeat it for a second slide. The weight of the slide will help to evenly spread out DAPI mounting media across the tissue sections. Repeat this step for all slides in the staining batch. Air dry slides in dark for 60–120 min and apply nail polish around the edge of coverslip to seal the slide for long-term storage. Slides are ready for microscopy, but if time permits, cure slides at 4 °C overnight for best autofocusing results. Microscopy Take pictures of each tissue section with an IF camera–equipped microscope by focusing on a DAPI channel. For small tissue samples (e.g., E12.5), at most instances a single field of view at 20× will fit the entire tissue section. For bigger sections (e.g., E13.5 and older) it will be necessary to take overlapping pictures of different fields of view and stitching them together in a photo-editing software. Alternatively, a virtual microscope slide scanner (e.g., Zeiss Axioscan Z1, Olympus V120) can be effectively used to automatically photograph, using DAPI channel as an autofocusing channel, and stich tissue sections together for further analysis ( Figure 7 ). As a general rule of better autofocusing, it is recommended to set up a shorter exposure time (faster DAPI focusing), and DAPI signal intensity should not exceed 30%–50% of its maximum histogram value. Figure 7. E16.5 pancreas section stained with anti-insulin Alexa-647 Ab with multiple fields of view stitched together. 2× magnification. Scale bar, 500 µm. Image analysis Use software (e.g., Visiopharm software with Author module) for multicolored IF imaging ( Figure 8A ): Uncheck all unnecessary staining channels (e.g., amylase, CK19, and DAPI, as shown in Figure 8A ) and draw small regions corresponding to at least three classes for segmentation purposes: ins+ (staining positive for insulin), the tissue (tissue area stained negatively for insulin), and background (slide area without tissue) ( Figure 8B and 8G ). If necessary, apply preprocessing step to better prepare image for segmentation (in example described in Figure 8 , we used a mean filter on insulin-staining channel, which helps to negate and equalize individual pixel variations in the background and specific staining patterns) and train a software, using Bayesian algorithm (or any other one suited for a given task). Make sure that the software can consistently recognize these areas ( Figure 8C and 8G ). Using postprocessing steps, remove unnecessary labels and small artifacts. In the example shown in Figure 8D and 8G , the label “background” was removed completely as it was not used in further calculations. The smallest ins+ spots measuring less than 12 μm in diameter and “tissue” labels measuring less than 20 μm in diameter also were removed as they usually represent artifacts. Perform segmentation of the entire image ( Figure 8E ) and, if necessary, check its consistency with other stains ( Figure 8F ). Figure 8. E16.5 pancreas, stained for insulin (green), amylase (purple), cytokeratin 19 (red), and nuclei (blue) was preprocessed, segmented, and fine-tuned (A-F) by using Visiopharm software Author module (G). 14× magnification. Scale bar, 100 µm. Comparable results can be obtained using open-sources software, including ImageJ/FiJi with Trainable Weka Segmentation package ( Heyne et al., 2015 ). For each pancreatic sample, calculate the following parameters: Total area occupied by insulin-producing cells Total tissue section area Calculate the percentage of area occupied by insulin-producing cells, according to the following formulas: Area occupied by insulin-producing cells/(tissue area + insulin-positive area) × 100% (if total section area value does not include insulin-positive area) or: Area occupied by insulin-producing cells/(tissue area) × 100% (if total section area value includes insulin-positive area already) Calculate beta cell mass: % of area occupied by insulin-producing cells × pancreas weight expressed in mg (optional if weighting scale permits such a small, consistent reading). For example, E16.5 healthy Balbc/cJ pups, on average, have 0.3857% ± 0.02327 of insulin-positive beta cell area ( Kryvalap et al., 2021 ).",

    "title": "Combined FLIM, Confocal Microscopy, and STED Nanoscopy for Live-Cell Imaging.",
    "abstract": "Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is a relevant technique to visualize biological events in living samples. Maintaining cell survival by limiting light-induced cellular stress is challenging and requires protocol development and image acquisition optimization. Here, we provide a guide by considering the quartet sample, probe, instrument, and image processing to obtain appropriate resolutions and information for live cell fluorescence imaging. The pleural mesothelial cell line H28, an adherent cell line that is easy to seed, was used to develop innovative advanced light microscopy strategies. The chosen red and near-infrared probes, capable of passively penetrating through the cell plasma membrane, are particularly suitable because their stimulation from 600 to 800 nm induces less cytotoxicity. The labeling protocol describes the concentration, time, and incubation conditions of the probes and associated adjustments for multi-labeling. To limit phototoxicity, acquisition parameters in advanced confocal laser scanning microscopy with a white laser are determined. Light power must be adjusted and minimized at red wavelengths for reduced irradiance (including a 775 nm depletion laser for STED nanoscopy), in simultaneous mode with hybrid detectors and combined with the fast FLIM module. These excellent conditions allow us to follow cellular and intracellular dynamics for a few minutes to several hours while maintaining good spatial and temporal resolutions. Lifetime analysis in lifetime imaging (modification of the lifetime depending on environmental conditions), lifetime dye unmixing (separation with respect to the lifetime value for the spectrally closed dye), and lifetime denoising (improvement of image quality) provide flexibility for multiplexing experiments. Key features • Cell preservation after labeling with less cytotoxic red, near-infrared dye viable probes. • Determination of lower but efficient probe concentration; adjust good balance between probes concentration and incubation time to achieve multi-labeling. • Long time-lapse acquisition in advanced confocal microscopy with sensitive new-generation detectors. • Confocal image combined with fast FLIM for multi-labeling with spectrally closed dyes, unmixed from lifetime values. • Confocal-STED image acquisition combined with fast FLIM to improve signal-to-noise ratio.",

Neubauer chamber (EMS, catalog number: 68052) 10. Dropping bottles (Avantor, catalog number: HECH41314050)\n\nProcedure A. Cell seeding 1. Culture H28 cells in complete RPMI cell culture medium [RPMI cell culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine (2 mM), and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution] at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . Grow cells in a T-25 flask until confluence before experiments (maximum 90% confluence). 2. Remove the media by aspiration with the safe liquid aspiration system from the cell culture flask and briefly wash the cells with prewarmed PBS (5 mL, 37 °C). 3. Remove the PBS by aspiration with the safe liquid aspiration system and apply 2 mL of prewarmed trypsin solution (37 °C). 4. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 2 min in the CO 2 incubator. 5. Add 5 mL of prewarmed complete RPMI cell culture medium and dissociate the cells by pipetting. 6. Transfer the dissociated cells to a 50 mL Falcon tube and centrifuge at 1,000× g for 5 min at room temperature. 7. Remove the supernatant by using the safe liquid aspiration system at low speed and resuspend the cells in 5–10 mL of complete RPMI cell culture medium. 8. Determine the number of cells per milliliter using a Neubauer chamber. 9. Plate 400,000 cells per cm 2 in 35 mm glass-bottom microwell dishes in 2 mL of complete RPMI cell culture medium and allow the cells to incubate for 1–2 days before staining and imaging. B. Probe preparations and cell staining 1. Probe preparation for storage (1,000× stock solutions) a. Dissolve wheat germ agglutinin Alexa Fluor 633 conjugate (AF633-WGA) powder in DMSO to obtain a 1 mg/mL stock solution. Aliquot 2 μL into 1.5 mL tubes and store at -20 °C. b. Resuspend Nile Red powder in pure methanol to obtain a 1 mg/mL stock solution. If aggregates are visible in the solution, sonicate for 2–5 min until the preparation is completely dissolved. Store the stock solution tube at 4 °C. c. Dissolve MitoTracker Red CMXRos (MTR) powder in DMSO to obtain a 1 mM stock solution. Aliquot 1 μL into 1.5 mL tubes and store at -20 °C d. Dissolve LBL-Dye M715 powder in DMSO to obtain a 2 mg/mL stock solution. Aliquot 2 μL into 1.5 mL tubes and store at -20 °C. As the fluorescence intensity of LBL-Dye M715 is strong, it may be necessary to dilute this solution up to 4-fold. e. Prepare Spirochrome probes as directed by the supplier by dissolving SPY650-FastAct and SPY620-DNA in 50 µL of DMSO to obtain a 1 mM stock solution stored at -20 °C. For SiR700-Act, supplement the 35 nmol with 100 µL of DMSO to obtain a 1 mM stock solution. One tube of 10 mM Verapamil (1,000× stock solution) is included in the SiR700-Act kit. Do not divide the solution into small aliquots, as indicated in the supplier’s datasheet. 2. Probe preparation with extemporaneous dilution for cell staining a. One to two days after seeding adherent cells onto 35 mm glass-bottom microwell dishes, cell density (40%–60% cell confluence/600–800,000 cells per cm 2 ), physiology state (shape and proliferation of the cells), and adherence are optimal for imaging. Freshly prepare probe(s) solutions as follows: b. For single labeling of cells with AF633-WGA, MTR, and LBL-Dye M715, freshly dilute the probe stored in a frozen stock tube at -20 °C in 1 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) complete RPMI cell culture medium to obtain a 2× solution. c. For single labeling of cells with Nile Red staining, transfer 2 μL of probe stored at 4 °C in 1 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) complete RPMI cell culture medium to obtain a 2× solution. For long-time acquisition (more than 30 min), the Nile Red solution can be diluted 2 or 3-fold to limit dye accumulation. d. For single labeling with SPY 650-FastAct or SPY 620-DNA, transfer 1–2 μL of probe in 1 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) complete RPMI cell culture medium to obtain a 2× solution. e. For single labeling of cells with SiR700-Act, transfer 1–2 μL of probe supplemented with 2 μL of Verapamil solution, to 1 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) complete RPMI cell culture medium to obtain a 2× solution. f. For multi-labeling of cells, the probes can be mixed in the same final tube containing 1 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) complete RPMI cell culture medium to obtain a 2× solution for both or all three probes. Probes are added directly into the cell culture medium depending on the minimum incorporation time (see step B3). 3. Cell staining for image acquisition a. Remove the medium from adherent cells onto 35 mm glass bottom microwell dishes. b. Gently apply 1 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) complete RPMI cell culture medium to the edge of the dishes. c. Transfer 1 mL of the diluted probe(s) 2× solution onto the cells, very gently, drop by drop. d. Incubate H28 cells with the probe(s) inside the incubator (37 °C/5% CO 2 ) for: - 10 min minimum with Nile Red probe(s), - 5–10 min with AF633-WGA to observe the incorporation of the dye at the plasma cell membrane level; 15 min minimum to observe the internalization of WGA for a few hours afterward in the cell cytoplasm, - 30 min minimum for MTR and LBL-Dye M715, - 1 h minimum for SPY620-DNA, SPY650-FastAct, and SiR700-Act. e. In case of complex multi-staining such as MTR combined with SiR700-Act or SPY620-DNA, or SiR700-Actin with LBL-Dye M715, a first incubation is performed with probes requiring long-time incubation (SiR700-Act, SPY620-DNA, SPY650-FastAct) for 30 min followed by another incubation of 30 min after adding directly the stock probe (1 μL of MTR or 2 μL of LBL-Dye M715, as indicated in steps B1c and B1e) to the cell culture dish and mixing gently by pipetting. f. Observe the cells directly under the microscope without removing the medium, unless there is a high level of nonspecific fluorescence signal (see Troubleshooting, Problem 4). C. Microscope setup for live cell imaging 1. Turn on the instrument (microscope controller, laser power, scanning laser head, FLIM module) and the computer. 2. After 10 min, open the LAS-X software. 3. If STED setup is to be used, select the option. 4. One or two hours before acquisition, warm up the chamber installed around the inverted microscope stand to the temperature of 37 °C. 5. Turn on the laser boxes and preheat the laser source to 85%–100% for the WLL laser (excitation laser). Note: As previously described [2, Figure S1], laser powers of 594, 638, and 685 nm at 100% AOTF are measured at 523, 386, and 382 µW ±4.5, respectively, without the objective in the light path through the optical power meter integrated in Argo-Power slide. 6. If the STED laser is to be used, turn on the 775 nm STED depletion laser at 100% (557 mW measured without the objective in the light path for 100% power setting). 7. Place the 86× water immersion objective suitable for live cell observation and apply a drop of distilled water to the surface of the objective lens by using a dropping bottle of distilled water. 8. Place the glass bottom microwell dish on the microscope stage and lift the objective until contacting with the water drop. 9. Place the cover in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . 10. Optimize the acquisition parameters: conventional scanner at 400 Hz, format 1024 × 1024 pixels, and pixel dwell time 1.4 μs (see Figure 1A ). To improve the acquisition speed, the scanning frequency can be increased to 600 Hz (pixel dwell time decreased to 875 ns) and in bidirectional mode (pixel dwell time: 600 ns). The low pixel dwell time can be compensated by line repetition to accumulate photons per pixel. The format can be reduced to 512 × 512 pixels if the biological element to observe does not require a small pixel size (pixel dwell time increased to 1.2 μs with format 512 × 512, scan rate 600 Hz, bidirectional scanning mode). An optimal standard Airy 1 pinhole is used by default. 11. Select the xyzt acquisition mode (see Figure 1B ). 12. Find focus and select an appropriate field of view with the microscope eyepiece. Figure 1. Screenshot of LAS X software for image acquisition of three dyes simultaneously. In this example, three probes (SPY620-DNA, SiR700-Act, and LBL-Dye M715), indicated by * in Table 1 , are acquired in one single detector after 618 nm laser excitation (5% WLL laser power). The confocal image, on the right side, shows one color image for the three dyes. D. Simultaneous confocal/confocal-STED image acquisition with fast FLIM module activation 1. Determine the excitation wavelength [power minimum between 2% and 6% of acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF)] as mentioned in Table 1 . 2. Activate the adapted detector for red dye(s), the HyD-X, in photon counting mode, and determine the emission band (see Figure 1C ). Note: Other detectors can be activated, in simultaneous mode, for multi-channel acquisition. Table 1. Excitation and emission wavelengths for dye(s) detection in unique HyD-X detector. Probe (dye) Exc (nm) Em (nm) in HyD-X detector AF633-WGA 633 640–670 Nile Red 600 615–670 MTR 590 605–630 LBL-Dye M715 690 705–740 SPY650-FastAct 650 660–715 SPY620-DNA 618 625–640 SiR700-Act 698 710–740 SPY650-FastAct + LBL-Dye M715 650 660–740 SPY620-DNA + SiR700-Act + LBL-Dye M715 (*) 618 625–740 3. In STED mode, activate the 775 nm at low power (2%–20 %) for depletion effect ( Figure 1 , yellow arrow). Note: As the lifetime characteristics of dyes are deeply modified by the depletion laser [13], it is recommended to use a separate detector for each dye in multi-labeling experiments. 4. Adapt the zoom factor and pixel size in coherence with the sample. Note: In STED mode, since spatial resolution is often the priority, it is necessary to zoom in until reaching an optimal pixel size of 20 nm. In this case, a strong accumulation of photons (by reasonably increasing the excitation laser power and preferably by adding scanning line accumulation) is essential to compensate for the reduced pixel size and to have sufficient signal to use the FLIM module. 5. Determine the Z up and down in case of z-stack acquisition. 6. Determine the time interval and total duration for time-lapse. 7. Activate the fast-integrated FLIM module (see the button in Figure 1D ), the so-called FAst Lifetime CONtrast (FALCON), with 1–3 line repetitions to reach a minimum of 50,000 photons per image. Note: If the spatial resolution is not a crucial point, enlarging the pinhole can be an alternative to line repetitions. 8. Acquire the confocal or confocal-STED image(s) ( Figure 1E ) by clicking Start . 9. A FLIM image appears in the second window in the LAS X FLIM/FCS software. E. Visualization of fast FLIM images 1. Data from the LAS X FLIM/FCS software are divided into three main parts: a. “FLIM” for lifetime imaging with FLIM fitting curve measurement or fast FLIM images ( Figure 2A ). b. “Phasor” FLIM image for lifetime imaging and phasor separation (lifetime dye unmixing; Figure 2B ). Note: The lifetime value is modified by the STED depletion laser and can be difficult to unmix. c. “τ-STED” for lifetime denoising of STED image only ( Figure 2C ). 2. The lifetime image can be directly exported by clicking on the Save image button ( Figure 2 , yellow arrow). 3. Lifetime dye unmixing images are produced after Phasor separation: select the draw cursor corresponding to the lifetime values of each dye ( Figure 3A ). Click on Separate ( Figure 3B ) and visualize the lifetime separation in fluorescence channels ( Figure 3C ). Save the image by clicking the corresponding button ( Figure 3 , yellow arrow). Note 1: It is necessary to control/measure the value for each dye separately to determine their respective positions on the Phasor plot representation . Note 2: A minimum lifetime difference of 0.4 ns seems to be necessary to spatially separate the dyes. 4. The τ-STED option ( Figure 2C ) is available for images acquired after STED laser activation. Choose the τ-strength and denoise level ( Figure 4B ) depending on dye signal emission (quality of biologic element observed; level of nonspecific signal and background). Lifetime denoising images can be combined with lifetime images acquired from two separate detectors (one with lifetime information and the other with lifetime denoising improvement). 5. All these acquisitions and data FLIM analysis can be performed in z-stack and time-lapse (xyzt), as seen in Figure 4 , with z and t lines (yellow arrows). In this example, the simultaneous 2-channels acquisition is performed through time-lapse containing 60 time points, one image every 10 s for 10 min, in a 4-z plan. Tracking and fluorescence intensity can be measured using the Manual Tracking plugin of Fiji software (see Figure 5 ). 6. All images are exported and saved through the Save image button in .lif format (Leica) and can be opened and analyzed with Fiji software (see Figure 6 ). Figure 2. Screenshot of LAS X FLIM/FCS window for FLIM data. The three main parts for data FLIM analysis are FLIM (A), Phasor (B), and τ-STED (C) analysis. Note that the τ-STED button is available only for confocal-STED images. In this Phasor window, the lifetime image is visualized in D, with a possibility to modify the scaling in intensity (black and white bar, E) and the scaling of lifetime values (rainbow bar, F). This image is obtained during confocal acquisition (Figure 1, with detector of SPY620-DNA, SiR700-Act, and LBL-Dye M715 in Hyd-X detector). Lifetime values of each pixel are distributed in Phasor plot (G). Figure 3. Lifetime dye unmixing of three dyes from the same confocal image . From the confocal image (Figure 1), the lifetime separation through the Phasor (Figure 3A) produced three channels (Figure 3C) corresponding to the separation of three lifetime value zones (A, left white circle, Tau 3.2 ns, SPY620-DNA; A, middle white circle, Tau 1.7 ns, SiR700-Act; A, right white circle, Tau 1.1 ns, LBL-Dye M715). Figure 4. Lifetime imaging and lifetime denoising information after sequential data treatment of two dyes signal in two detectors. In this example, STED acquisition is realized from cells double-labeled with MTR (channel 1, Exc 590, 1% WLL laser power, HyD-S 605–630 nm) and SiR700-Act (channel 2, Exc 698 nm, 6% WLL laser power, HyD-X 710–740 nm). Window A shows the lifetime image of MTR and SiR700-Act; the FLIM analysis can be realized in τ-STED mode to improve image quality (lifetime denoising, B). The Denoise parameter at “50” is sufficient for MTR; the background is higher for SiR700-Act, and the value can be increased to 70 to improve the resulting image after lifetime denoising. The combination of these two distinct FLIM analyses is possible (MTR with its informative lifetime image; SiR700-Act with the thin structure of actin improved by FLIM denoising). Figure 5. Tracking analysis illustration with ImageJ Macro. Time-lapse of mitochondrial dynamics in H28 cells labeled with LBL-Dye M715 and STED acquisition followed by lifetime denoising processing (Exc 690 nm, 3% WLL laser power, HyD-X 705–740 nm, 2% STED laser 775 nm). Tracking and fluorescence intensity are measured using the Manual Tracking plugin of Fiji software [12]. Trajectory (A) is drawn in Fire LUT in the final image (t35 min) and the corresponding graph representing the distance traveled by the element from the origin point (t0, *) in function of time (35 min of acquisition) is shown in B. The white arrow represents the direction of mitochondrial movement. Figure 6. Fiji/ImageJ to import and analyze dye unmixing. From the confocal image (Figure 1), the lifetime dye unmixing of three dyes separated in three channels, Fiji/ImageJ software allows the exportation of the image in .tif format, histogram scaling, and LUT attribution to obtain a definitive image with a scale bar.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research articles: Bénard et al.

    "title": "Fluorescence Lifetime-Based Separation of FAST-Labeled Cellular Compartment.",
    "abstract": "Here, we present a protocol for implementing the fluorogen-activating protein FAST (fluorescence-activating and absorption-shifting tag) in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), which allows separating fluorescent species in the same spectral channel based on fluorescence lifetime properties. Previous studies have demonstrated FLIM multiplexing using various combinations of synthetic probes, fluorescent proteins, or self-labeling tags. In this protocol, we utilize engineered FAST point mutation variants that bind fluorogen HBR-2,5-DM. The designed probes possess nearly identical, compact protein sizes (14 kDa), and the resulting protein-fluorogen complexes demonstrate comparable steady-state optical properties and exhibit distinct fluorescence lifetimes, displaying monoexponential fluorescence decay kinetics. When FAST variants are expressed with localization signals, these properties facilitate robust signal separation in regions with co-localized or spatially overlapping labels (nucleus and cytoskeleton in this protocol) in live mammalian cells. This method can be applied to separate other overlapping cellular compartments, such as the nucleus and Golgi apparatus, or mitochondria and cytoskeleton. Key features • The protocol employs FAST protein technology for fluorescent labeling. • Separation of cellular compartments in the green channel (emission wavelength ~500-550 nm) using fluorescence lifetime data. • Requires no coding skills. • The protocol is optimized for SPCImage software.",

T25 culture flask (SPL Life Sciences, catalog number: 70025)\n\nProcedure A. Cell culture and transfection 1. Select pairs of H2B- and vimentin-fused FAST variants using Table 1 as a reference for fluorescence lifetimes. Notes: 1. We performed successful separation of FAST variants with ≥0.3 ns fluorescence lifetime difference. 2. Vimentin and nuclear structures have distinguishable morphologies with spatial overlap, effectively demonstrating the method's capabilities. The protocol is not restricted to this specific pair. We successfully separated combinations of FAST variants with other localization signals available in-house, including Lifeact (actin-binding peptide), ensconsin (tubulin-binding protein), peroxisomal targeting signal, mitochondrial intermembrane space targeting signal, and β4Gal-T1 (Golgi apparatus). Table 1. Fluorescence lifetimes of FAST-HBR-2,5-DM complexes measured in cellulo FAST variant Fluorescence lifetime* R52K 1.4 ns P68T 1.7 ns P68K 1.9 ns F62L 2.2 ns *Data for FAST variants expressed as H2B fusion constructs. Note: While this table provides reference fluorescence lifetimes for FAST variants, the cellular environment can affect these values. In our experience, fluorescence lifetimes of vimentin-FAST fusion constructs show similar values to the corresponding H2B-FAST data presented above. We recommend conducting separate measurements for each variant in its intended cellular localization to obtain accurate values for your specific conditions, especially when imaging alternative cellular compartments. 2. Grow HeLa cells in 5 mL of DMEM complete medium (see Recipes) in a T25 culture flask until cells reach 80%–90% confluency. Maintain cultures in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . 3. Warm DMEM complete medium and Trypsin-Versene solution (see Recipes) to 37 °C. 4. Aspirate DMEM complete medium from the flask using a 10 mL serological pipette and a large-capacity pipette. Add to the flask 1 mL of Trypsin-Versene solution using a 1 mL micropipette, gently rock the flask 3 times, and remove the solution with the same micropipette to eliminate FBS-containing DMEM residues. Add 1 mL of Trypsin-Versene solution and return the culture flask to the incubator for 3–5 min. 5. During cell incubation with Trypsin-Versene, fill 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dishes with 2 mL of DMEM complete medium. Notes: 1. Prepare three dishes per FAST variant pair to ensure sufficient data reproducibility. 2. We strongly recommend acquiring data for each FAST variant individually in the intended cellular localization to obtain accurate lifetime values for your specific conditions, not only as pairs. 6. Resuspend the detached cells from step A4 using a 1 mL micropipette by pipetting up and down five times. Add 3 mL of DMEM complete medium to neutralize trypsin activity and resuspend cells again using a 10 mL serological pipette by pipetting up and down five times. 7. Reserve 0.5 mL of cell suspension in the T25 culture flask for subsequent passaging and add 4.5 mL of DMEM complete medium to it. Add 3 drops (160 μL) of cell suspension to each prepared 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dish from step A5. Gently agitate the flask and dishes 10 times using a lightning-shaped motion (zigzag: forward-left, right, forward-left, back-right to start). Return cells to the cell culture incubator. 8. Grow cells on 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dishes until reaching 60% confluency. 9. Warm Opti-MEM (see Recipes) to room temperature. 10. Aspirate DMEM complete medium from cell-containing 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dishes using a 10 mL serological pipette and a large-capacity pipette, wash cells once with 1 mL of Opti-MEM, and add 0.5 mL of Opti-MEM to each dish. Return to the cell culture incubator and incubate for 1 h. Note: This incubation time includes PEI–DNA complex formation; therefore, initiate the following protocol steps 30 min after the medium change in step A10. 11. In a 1.5 mL microtube, mix 250 μL of room temperature Opti-MEM (1 mL micropipette) with 4.5 μL of room temperature PEI (2–20 μL micropipette) per dish. In a separate 1.5 mL microtube, mix 250 μL of room temperature Opti-MEM (1 mL micropipette) with 0.3 μg of H2B-FAST variant coding plasmid and 1.2 μg of vimentin-FAST variant coding plasmid (both dissolved in nuclease-free water, room temperature) using a 0.5–10 μL micropipette per dish. Incubate both mixtures at room temperature for 5 min. Note: Solutions for 1–3 dishes can be prepared in a single 1.5 mL microtube by scaling up the volumes accordingly. 12. Add the entire volume of the DNA-containing Opti-MEM mixture to the PEI-containing Opti-MEM using a 1 mL micropipette and vortex for 3 s. Incubate the resulting solution at room temperature for 20 min. 13. Using a 1 mL micropipette, add the DNA–PEI mixture dropwise to cell-containing 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dishes. Gently agitate 10 times. Return cells to the incubator and incubate for 3.5 h. 14. Aspirate Opti-MEM from cell-containing 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dishes using a 1 mL micropipette and replace it with DMEM complete medium (37 °C) using a 10 mL serological pipette and a large-capacity pipette. Return cells to the incubator and incubate for 24–48 h. Notes: 1. FAST proteins do not require maturation time and can be imaged the following day. The experiment can be postponed for an additional day for convenience; however, avoid allowing cells to become overgrown. 2. Cells may be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) if required. We found no significant impact on fluorescence lifetimes for the H2B- and vimentin-FAST variant fusion constructs when using fixed samples. It should be noted that our testing was limited to this particular combination. B. Live-cell fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy 1. Prepare HBR-2,5-DM-containing imaging solution (see Recipes) on the day of the imaging experiment. 2. Aspirate DMEM complete medium from cell-containing dishes using a 10 mL serological pipette and a large-capacity pipette. Add 1 mL of room temperature imaging solution (see Recipes) using a 1 mL micropipette, gently rock the dishes three times, and remove the solution with the same micropipette to eliminate DMEM residues. Then, add 2 mL of room temperature HBR-2,5-DM-containing imaging solution using a 10 mL serological pipette and a large-capacity pipette. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Note: HBR-2,5-DM-containing imaging solution utilizes pH buffering independent of the CO 2 /HCO 3 − system. Therefore, cell-containing dishes should be maintained outside the CO 2 incubator environment. 3. Set the climate control system temperature at 25 °C and adjust the temperature of the room to avoid thermal shifts of equipment. Switch on the FLIM equipment. Note: Avoid door openings and air winds near the microscope. 4. Add Type F immersion oil to the objective and put the sample into the holder. 5. Focus on the object using the eyepieces and switch the microscope to the confocal port. Note: Check the sample fixation and focusing knob tension to ensure that the drift is appropriate during image acquisition. 6. Open SPCM software. Note: There are basic steps of image acquisition. Please read the original Becker and Hickl Manual before starting. 7. In the Galvano Scanner menu (Devices → Galvano Scanner ), push Preview and move the sample to find the appropriate field of view. Note: The 100× objective with 1.3NA has aberration of the field. You can use a 2× or higher zoom of the selected field to obtain an image with uniform intensity distribution. 8. Adjust laser power and scan time. Note: The analysis needs at least 10 3 photons per analysis point (individual pixel or several binned pixels, see step A2 of Data analysis). Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) count rate has restrictions and must be lower than 1% of the laser repetition rate. In our setup, it was not higher than 6 × 10 5 photons per second in the brightest pixel of the acquisition region (monitored via the left-bottom area of the software interface showing the ADC level). 9. Set StopT flag. 10. Set Repeat to frame in Galvano scanner control and scan 1 frame. Check the photon quantity (event number in the status bar, blue line in Device state area) and calculate the appropriate number of frames to obtain nearly 10 8 photons per final image. You can also set Repeat to continuous and set the appropriate Collection time. Note: Set a higher number of frames. You can stop scanning earlier. 11. Push Start Scan to start acquisition. 12. After data collection is stopped, save the raw data as an .sdt file ( Main → Save ). 13. Export data to SPCImage (press F9) and save file as an .img file ( Main → Save ).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article: • Bogdanova et al.

    "title": "Characterizing Tissue Oxygen Tension During Neurogenesis in Human Cerebral Organoids.",
    "abstract": "Oxygen tension is a key regulator of early human neurogenesis; however, quantifying intra-tissue O2 in 3D models for an extended period remains difficult. Existing approaches, such as needle-type fiber microsensors and intensity-based oxygen probes or time-domain lifetime imaging, either perturb the organoids or require high excitation doses that limit the measurement period. Here, we present a step-by-step protocol to measure intra-organoid oxygen in human cerebral organoids (hCOs) using embedded ruthenium-based CPOx microbeads and widefield frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FD-FLIM). The workflow covers dorsal/ventral cerebral organoid patterning, organoid fusion at day 12 with co-embedded CPOx beads, standardized FD-FLIM acquisition (470-nm external modulation, 16 phases at 50 kHz, dual-tap camera), automated bead detection and lifetime extraction in MATLAB, and session-matched Stern-Volmer calibration with Ru(dpp)3(ClO4)2 to convert lifetimes to oxygen concentration. The protocol outputs per-bead oxygen maps and longitudinal patterns stratified by bead location (intra-organoid vs. gel) and sample state (healthy vs. abnormal), enabling direct linkage between developmental growth and oxygen dynamics. Key features • End-to-end workflow linking hCOs generation, on-gel bead embedding, and FD-FLIM oxygen readout. • Longitudinal single-organoid tracking of oxygen tension with bead-level metadata. • Reference-based lifetime calibration and reproducible camera/LED settings. • Ready-to-reuse materials, recipes, timing, and analysis logic.",

Generate human cerebral organoids (days 0–12) 1. EB formation (days 0–5): a. Dissociate hiPSC colonies with Accumax to single cells. Seed 12,000 cells/well into ultra-low-attachment 96-well round-bottom plates in 150 μL of AggreWell TM EB formation medium with 10 μM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor). Do not disturb the plate for at least 24 h. After 24 h, small EBs (100–200 μm in diameter) should be observed with a layer of unincorporated cells around the central EB. b. On days 2 and 4, exchange the media by removing ~75% of the media in each well and adding 150 μL of fresh AggreWell TM EB formation medium (without Y-27632). Critical: Achieving uniform cell suspension and seeding density is essential for generating consistent, uniform embryoid body (EB) size, which directly impacts later neurogenesis. 2. Neural induction (days 5–12): a. Monitor EB diameter under brightfield microscopy. When EBs exceed ~500 μm, carefully remove ~75% of the medium from each well and replace with prewarmed NI medium. Avoid disturbing the aggregates. Note: The diameter of the EBs was directly quantified under brightfield microscopy using a calibrated ocular micrometer. b. Continue culture in NI medium and apply regional cues: • Dorsal identity: Add Cyclopamine A 5 μM (SHH inhibitor) for 6 days. Refresh NI with small molecules every other day. • Ventral identity: Add IWP-2 2.5 μM (WNT inhibitor) with SAG 100 nM (SHH agonist) for 6 days. Refresh NI with small molecules every other day. Critical: EBs that grow irregular, non-circular/elliptical shapes or fail to generate an expanded radialized neuroepithelium should be discarded. 3. Fusion (day 12): a. Embed one dorsal EB with one ventral EB together in a single cold Matrigel droplet (see Section B for optional CPOx addition). b. Transfer to ultra-low-attachment 24-well plates with hCOs expansion medium. c. After 4 days of stationary culture, switch to hCOs maturation medium and place on a shaker for maturation. Critical: Place the 24-well plate on an orbital shaker inside the incubator. Set the shaker speed to 90–100 rpm [6–8] to ensure adequate nutrient exchange and oxygen delivery without causing excessive shear stress to the developing organoids. B. Embed CPOx beads at the time of fusion (day 12) 1. Thaw Matrigel on ice. Prepare CPOx bead stock solution at 10 mg/mL (DPBS with 1% BSA). Keep on ice. 2. Mix bead stock 1:20 (v/v) with cold Matrigel immediately (CPOx-containing matrigel) prior to fusion. 3. In a single Matrigel droplet, co-embed one dorsal EB with one ventral EB with bead-mixed Matrigel. Position organoids so that the neuroepithelial surfaces oppose and gently touch to promote tissue continuity; avoid bubbles. Polymerize for ≥30–40 min at 37 °C. Caution: Matrigel must be kept on ice at all times before polymerization. Premature solidification will prevent proper embedding and fusion. C. Basic configuration settings for FD-FLIM imaging acquisition 1. PCO.FLIM camera setup: a. Switch on the camera and launch the Look@FLIM control and acquisition software on the connected workstation. b. Once the camera is detected and operational, Look@FLIM enables control via the Camera menu. c. Navigate to the SEQUENCE CONFIGURATION tab. This tab contains three configuration sections: In the Modulation section: • Under Source Select , choose Internal to configure the internal direct digital synthesizer to generate modulation signals. • Under Output Waveform , select Sinusoidal to produce a sinusoidal modulation output from the camera. • Set the Master Frequency to 50 kHz, optimized for lifetime measurements of CPOx beads. • Leave Relative Phase at its default value (0°) to avoid manual phase offset adjustments between the camera’s modulation signal and any external output. In the Phase Sequence section: • Set Phase Number to 16, which captures 16 evenly spaced phase points across one full 360° modulation cycle. Note: Available options are 2, 4, 8, and 16; higher phase numbers improve waveform fidelity. • Set Phase Symmetry to Singular , so that only one phase sequence is acquired. • Set Tap Select to Both , enabling readout from both tap A and tap B for enhanced signal quality. In the Image Processing section: • Under Asymmetry Correction , select No to disable internal asymmetry correction by the camera. • Adjust the Exposure Time (in milliseconds) to ensure adequate fluorescence signal intensity. Note: Refer to the next section of the protocol for optimal exposure time guidance based on fluorophore brightness and sample conditions. 2. LED illumination setup: a. Connect the high-power LED to the LED driver using the SMA connector located on the rear panel of the driver. b. Switch on the LED driver. c. Set the LED driver to External Modulation Mode by selecting the corresponding function on the front panel. In this mode, the sinusoidal modulation signal is supplied externally by the PCO.FLIM camera. Note: The external voltage signal from the FLIM camera modulates the LED current in synchrony with image acquisition, ensuring proper phase alignment. d. During the experiment, use the “ LED is OFF ” button on the driver's front panel to toggle the LED light ON or OFF, as needed. D. Reference image acquisition using an FD-FLIM camera 1. Preparation of the reference droplet: a. Place a droplet of an oxygen-sensitive fluorescent dye of 25 μM Ru(dpp) 3 (ClO 4 ) 2 solution onto a microscope slide. Note: The 25 μM Ru(dpp) 3 (ClO4) 2 solution was used as a reference standard for calculating the lifetimes of the oxygen-sensitive beads. Because instrumental artifacts—such as sensor nonlinearity and limited dynamic range—can arise from the electronic and optical setup, a relative measurement against a sample with a known fluorescence lifetime was performed. This reference measurement corrects for system-dependent deviations and ensures more accurate lifetime determination of the CPOx beads. b. Gently cover the droplet with a microscope cover glass to seal the sample. 2. Microscope setup: a. Launch the Leica LAS X life science imaging software to control the stage and imaging parameters of the inverted microscope. b. Set the objective lens to 5× magnification. c. Use the following filter settings: excitation (Ex): 420–490 nm and emission (Em): 570–670 nm. 3. Focusing: Adjust the stage to focus on the bottom surface of the Ru(dpp) 3 (ClO 4 ) 2 dye droplet for consistent imaging. 4. Reference image acquisition: Use the Look@FLIM software to acquire a fluorescence image set across multiple phase angles using the PCO.FLIM camera. This image set will serve as the FD-FLIM reference image set for subsequent lifetime analysis. Caution: Ensure that the selected field of view (FOV) is free of defects or artifacts. Note: To confirm system stability, acquire several reference image sets at different positions on the sample and check their phasor plots. Refer to the “Oxygen level calculation” section of Data analysis) for details on phasor plot interpretation. E. CPOx image acquisition using an FD-FLIM camera 1. Sample preparation: Place the 24-well plate containing the organoids with embedded CPOx beads onto the microscope stage. 2. Microscope setup (a schematic of the instrument setup for FD-FLIM is shown in Figure 1A ): a. Use the microscope control software, LAS X, to position the target organoid within the field of view (FOV). b. Focus the objective lens precisely on the target organoid. Figure 1. Instrument setup for frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FD-FLIM) and confocal image for validation of CPOx bead localization in human cerebral organoids (hCOs). (A) Schematic of the inverted widefield frequency-domain FLIM system used for live oxygen measurements. The setup includes a 470-nm high-power LED under external modulation, an inverted fluorescence microscope with appropriate excitation/emission filters (Ex 420–490 nm/Em 570–670 nm), and a dual-tap FLIM camera for multi-phase acquisition. (B) Confocal image of a cerebral organoid after 26 days in culture, stained with CellMask (green) to delineate tissue architecture and to localize the oxygen-sensitive CPOx microbeads (red). Scale bar: 100 μm. 3. Live-cell imaging: Acquire a live-cell fluorescence image set using the Leica DMI6000 B inverted microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu monochrome CCD camera. Use filter settings as follows: excitation (Ex): 420–490 nm, Emission (Em): 570–670 nm for CPOx beads and Ex: 608–648 nm, Em: 672–712 nm for CellMask TM plasma membrane stain. 4. FD-FLIM image acquisition: a. Based on the live-cell image set, confirm the location of the organoids through CellMask staining and identify the target CPOx beads ( Figure 1B ). b. For each CPOx bead, use the Look@FLIM software to acquire a fluorescence image set across multiple phase angles using the PCO.FLIM camera. c. Repeat this step until all FLIM image sets of the identified CPOx beads are collected. Caution: For each image set, record and label the following metadata: i. Time point ii. Organoid ID iii. CPOx bead ID(s) iv. Bead location (e.g., inside organoid or in gel matrix) v. (Tip) To ensure accurate tracking and future validation, it is recommended to label each CPOx bead in the live-cell image set using bead numbers or ROI markers. 5. Longitudinal image sets: Repeat steps E2–4 every 3 or 7 days, depending on the experimental schedule, until FD-FLIM image sets have been acquired for all intended time points.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: • Liu et al.

    "title": "Genetic Tagging and Imaging of Proteins with iFAST in Candida albicans.",
    "abstract": "Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen, able to reside in a broad range of niches within the human body. Even though C. albicans systemic infection is associated with high mortality, the fungus has historically received relatively little attention, resulting in a lack of optimized molecular and fluorescent tools. Over the last decade, some extra focus has been put on the optimization of fluorescent proteins (FPs) of C. albicans. However, as the FPs are GFP-type, they require an aerobic environment and a relatively long period to fully mature. Recently, we have shown the application of a novel type of fluorogen-based FP, with an improved version of fluorescence activating and absorption shifting tag (iFAST), in C. albicans. Due to the dynamic relation between iFAST and its fluorogens, the system has the advantage of being reversible in terms of fluorescence. Furthermore, the combination of iFAST with different fluorogens results in different spectral and cellular properties, allowing customization of the system. Key features • Genetic integration and tagging with the iFAST tag in Candida albicans. • Imaging and localization of a protein of interest tagged with iFAST. • Reversibility of fluorescence with iFAST.",

We describe how to do this in order to obtain an endogenous tag or an overexpression construct. This protocol has been used to tag Ftr1 and Erg11, endogenously or as an overexpression construct, respectively [15]. Furthermore, we also describe a protocol to utilize the reversibility of the iFAST system to alter the absorption and excitation maxima of the tagged construct by exchanging the fluorogen. All steps of this protocol were performed at room temperature (22 °C) unless stated otherwise. Transformation of Candida albicans (see General note 1) Streak the wild-type C. albicans (SC5314) from the -80 °C stock and plate on YPD agar at 30 °C overnight (ON). Transfer a single colony to 3 mL of YPD and grow ON at 30 °C in a shaking incubator (at 240 rpm). Measure the cell density of the culture at 600 nm using the BioPhotometer. Dilute the ON culture to an OD 600 of 0.2–0.4 in 50 mL of YPD in a 300 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate again at 30 °C and grow the cells to a density of approximately 1.5; this will take 3–4 h. Pellet the cells at 1,000× g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 0.7 mL of LiAc/TE buffer. While adding the LiAc/TE buffer, mix the cells well by pipetting up and down. Pipette in a new Eppendorf tube (in the following order): 100 µL of the cell suspension in LiAc/TE buffer. DNA (1 µg) that needs to be transformed. i. In the case of a plasmid: First, linearize the plasmid via a restriction digestion. Then, use the unpurified restriction product. ii. In case of PCR: Use 50 µL of unpurified linear PCR product. 20 µL of fish sperm ssDNA (10 mg/mL) (preheated to 98 °C for 5 min and cooled to 50 °C). Leave at room temperature for 10 min. 0.7 mL of LiAc/PEG buffer. Vortex shortly. Incubate for 16 h at 30 °C while shaking (300 rpm). Heat-shock the cell mixture using a heat block for 15 min at 44 °C. Pellet cells at 5,200× g for 1 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of YPD. Let the cells recover for 4 h at 30 °C while shaking (300 rpm). Pellet the cells at 5,200× g for 1 min. Plate out on YPD agar containing 200 mg/L nourseothricin for both the pFA6-based endogenous tagging and the overexpression strains using the CIp10 plasmid. Incubate for 24 h at 30 °C and re-streak to single colonies on YPD-NAT agar. The plates should contain approximately 20 colonies for the pFA6 transformation and more than 100 colonies for the CIp10 transformation. Colonies are verified based on the presence and localization of fluorescence under the confocal microscope. Alternatively, the transformation can be checked through colony PCR [16], targeting the tagged gene and iFAST (for iFAST reverse primer, see Table S3). Since the integration efficiency of the linearized CIp10 plasmid was around 90% in our case, testing five colonies proved to be sufficient. The integration efficiency of the PCR product for endogenous tagging of genes was less efficient (approximately 10%–20%), so at least 12 colonies were tested in that case. Endogenous protein tagging with iFAST The iFAST-SAT1 construct will be integrated between the end of the gene and the beginning of the terminator. For this, a forward and reverse primer need to be constructed with a sequence that overlaps with specific regions within the genome and binds on the pFA6-iFAST plasmid (available on AddGene: #209414). The genomic sequences of C. albicans genes can be accessed at http://www.candidagenome.org (see General note 2). Design the forward primer to contain the last 50 bp of the gene of interest (GOI) excluding the stop codon, a double GGGGS linker (“GGAGGTGGAGGTTCTGGTGGAGGTGGTTCA”), and the first 20 bp of iFAST (“ATGGAACATGTTGCCTTTGG”). The reverse primer consists of the first 50 complementary bp of the GOI terminator and the last 20 bp of the SAT1 gene (“TTAGGCGTCATCCTGTGCTC”). Using the constructed primers, amplify the iFAST-SAT1 construct from the pFA6-iFAST plasmid using Q5 HiFi DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the protocol in Table 1 . The master mix was made following the manufacturer’s instructions. Table 1.

Select on medium containing 200 mg/L nourseothricin (see General note 3). Pick a colony and re-streak again to obtain single colonies on YPD-NAT agar before continuing. Colonies are verified based on fluorescence and its localization under the confocal microscope or by PCR, targeting the GOI and the iFAST gene (for iFAST reverse primer, see Table S3). To check protein localization, grow a single colony overnight in low fluorescence medium at 30 °C. Dilute the culture in fresh medium to OD 600 0.2–0.4 and grow for 4–5 h until the mid-exponential phase (~OD 600 1). Incubate the strain for 15 min in low fluorescence medium with 50 µM of fluorogen. Afterward, add 1–2 µL of culture to a standard microscopy slide, cover with a coverslip, and check under the confocal microscope. Choose the settings of the microscope in accordance with the fluorogen ( Table 2 ). Transfer verified colonies to YPD-glycerol medium and place at -80 °C for long-term storage. Overexpression tagging with iFAST In silico Gibson cloning The construction of the plasmid for overexpression tagging is based on Gibson assembly [17]. In the NEBuilder tool ( https://nebuilder.neb.com/#!/ ) or a similar in silico cloning tool, insert the sequence of the plasmid backbone (CIp10-NAT1; AddGene: #225583) (Text S1). Process the plasmid for restriction digestion with PstI and NheI to allow the integration of two inserts. As the first insert, add the full DNA sequence of the GOI, excluding the stop codon. As the second fragment to insert, add the full iFAST sequence (Text S2). In between these fragments, add a double [GGGGS] 2 linker. In vitro cloning Using the primers constructed by the in silico cloning tool, amplify the GOI and iFAST using Q5 HiFi DNA polymerase using the protocol in Table 1 (see General note 4). Amplify the sequence of the GOI from isolated gDNA. iFAST can be amplified from an iFAST-containing plasmid (pFA6a-iFAST available on AddGene: #209414) or gBlock. Afterward, purify the PCR fragments using the NucleoSpin TM Gel and PCR Clean-up kit and measure the concentration using Nanodrop. After the restriction of the backbone plasmid with PstI and NheI, purify the restriction mixture using the NucleoSpin TM Gel and PCR Clean-up kit. Measure the concentration of the purified, restricted plasmid using Nanodrop. Construct the overexpression plasmid by ligating the linearized vector with the two PCR products (GOI and iFAST). The ligation mixture to do this consists of 50 ng of plasmid and a molar ratio of plasmid:fragments of 1:3 with 10 µL of NEBuilder ® HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix and the total volume adjusted to 20 µL. This mixture was incubated at 50 °C for up to 1 h (see General note 5). 50 n g × 3 × f r a g m e n t s i z e ( b p ) p l a s m i d s i z e ( b p ) = f r a g m e n t ( n g ) Amplify the constructed plasmid using chemically competent E. coli [18]. Afterward, purify the plasmids using the NucleoSpin TM Plasmid EasyPure kit. Before transformation into C. albicans , linearize the plasmid using restriction digestion by StuI. Transformation into C. albicans is done according to an adapted Gietz protocol (section A). After transformation, select on YPD-NAT. Re-streak to single colonies and check successful tagging using fluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, colonies can be checked by PCR targeting the GOI and the iFAST gene. The FW primer within the GOI is unique, whilst the RV primer for the iFAST gene is “TTGCCAATCACTTGTTTGGG”. To check protein localization, grow a single colony overnight in low fluorescence medium at 30 °C. Dilute the culture in fresh medium to OD 600 0.2–0.4 and grow for 4–5 h until the mid-exponential phase (~OD 600 1). Incubate the strain for 15 min in low fluorescence medium with 50 µM of fluorogen. Afterward, add 1–2 µL of culture to a standard microscopy slide, cover with a coverslip, and check under the confocal microscope. Choose the settings of the microscope in accordance with the fluorogen ( Table 2 ). Transfer verified colonies to YPD-glycerol medium and place at -80 °C for long-term storage. Reversible fluorescence of iFAST Grow the transformed cells overnight at 30°C in low fluorescence medium ( Figure 1 ). Dilute the transformed strain in fresh low fluorescence medium to OD 600 of 0.2 and grow for 4–5 h until the mid-exponential phase (~OD 600 1). Before starting the experiment, predetermine the time points at which you want to image the cells (see General note 6). Prior to adding any fluorogen, add 1–2 µL of culture on a standard microscopy slide, cover with a coverslip, and image using the fluorescent microscope (see section E). Use this during the analysis as the pre-treatment condition. Add the fluorogen to the culture for a final concentration of 50 µM of fluorogen and a final volume of 1 mL. For each predetermined time point repeat the following steps: Add 1–2 µL of the culture on a standard microscopy slide and cover with a coverslip. Let the rest of the culture incubate at 30 °C with gentle shaking (300 rpm) until the next time point. Image the sample under the confocal microscope (see section E). After the last time point, wash the cells twice by spinning down (1 min at 5,200× g ), replacing the supernatant with medium lacking fluorogen. Image 1–2 µL of the culture on a standard microscopy slide after each of the washing steps (see General note 7). If desired, the same culture can be used to repeat this experiment with another fluorogen to exploit the multicolor characteristic of the iFAST protein. For this, use the washed culture and repeat from step D4 ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Diagram of the experimental steps of section D. All incubation steps are performed at 30 °C. Sample preparation and confocal microscopy For handling the microscope, we used a previously published protocol [19]. For the selection of the laser lines, excitation filter, and appropriate emission filters for the different fluorogens, see Table 2 . Aside from the fluorescent channel, concurrent DIC or brightfield images are taken (see General note 8). From the FV-10 software (or other user-specific software), images of both channels are exported to a (multi-)TIFF format (see General note 9). Table 2.

    "title": "Monitoring Changes in Intracellular Chloride Levels Using the FRET-Based SuperClomeleon Sensor in Organotypic Hippocampal Slices.",
    "abstract": "The reduction in intracellular neuronal chloride concentration is a crucial event during neurodevelopment that shifts GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Alterations in chloride homeostasis are implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent advancements in biosensor technology allow the simultaneous determination of intracellular chloride concentration of multiple neurons. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for the use of the ratiometric chloride sensor SuperClomeleon (SClm) in organotypic hippocampal slices. We record chloride levels as fluorescence responses of the SClm sensor using two-photon microscopy. We discuss how the SClm sensor can be effectively delivered to specific cell types using virus-mediated transduction and describe the calibration procedure to determine the chloride concentration from SClm sensor responses. Key features • Calibration and use of the ratiometric chloride sensor SuperClomeleon to measure intracellular chloride levels in mouse organotypic hippocampal slices. • SuperClomeleon sensor expression in pyramidal cells or GABAergic interneurons using adeno-associated viruses.",

Organotypic hippocampal slice preparation Note 1: Organotypic hippocampal slice preparation can also be prepared from rat pups. Note 2: The age of mouse pups used for organotypic hippocampal slice preparation ranges from ~P4 to P11. We typically use P6–P8 mice for our hippocampal cultures. 1. Preparation: a. Put culture medium (see Recipes) in the incubator to warm up: 15 mL per brain for dissection and 1 mL per culture well (typically, 4 wells are used per brain). b. Prepare GBSS solution (see Recipes; 50 mL per brain + 50 mL extra) using a sterile pipette in a flow hood. Add the pre-filtered (0.2 μm filter) glucose (2.5 M, 1 mL) and kynurenic acid (0.1 M, 0.5 mL) from stocks in the freezer to the GBSS solution. c. Check the pH of the GBSS; it should be 7.2. The osmolarity should also be checked to be approximately 320 mOsm. Note: Initial osmolarity is usually too low; as such, add sucrose. For reference, a 5 mOsm increase in 100 mL of GBSS requires ~170 mg of sucrose. 600 mg of sucrose in 100 mL of GBSS should get the solution to the desired osmolarity of 320 (±5) mOsm. If it is still too low, keep adding sucrose until the osmolarity reaches ~320 (±5) mOsm. d. Filter the GBSS solution through a 0.2 μm filter. e. Put one 50 mL tube with ~40 mL of GBSS in the freezer 45 min prior to dissection. For following dissection procedures, the GBSS tubes should be temporarily stored in the fridge 45 min prior to dissection. f. Put ~15 mL of GBSS in a 15 mL tube in the fridge. g. Clean all instruments before use by consecutively putting them in deionized water (MilliQ), 70% ethanol, and 96% ethanol for 5 min each. Finally, sterilize them for 10 s at 250 °C using a bead sterilizer. h. Prepare a 6-well plate per brain. Add 1 mL of culture medium per well and add an insert into each well. On each insert, put three 8 × 8 mm (approximately) cutouts of a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane. Make sure to use sterilized tweezers (using the bead sterilizer) and to sterilize the membranes after cutting using a UV light for at least 20 min. Notes: 1. It is advisable to cut out asymmetric shapes. This makes it easier to recognize the orientation of the slice when transferring to the bath of the two-photon microscope. 2. Slices can be sterilized using the UV function of the cell culture hood or a UV sterilizer. i. Finish the rest of the preparation for the dissection: add blades to the scalpels, take out one small and one big Petri dish per brain, put a filter paper in the big Petri dish using sterilized tweezers, add a razor blade to the chopper, and put a PVC membrane on the chopper surface. Figure 1 shows the final setup of the work area. Figure 1. Dissection tools and working area. A. Overview of the working area and essential tools needed for dissection. From left to right: chopper, sterilizer, 200 μL pipette and tips, dissection tools, Petri dishes, and a microscope. B. Zoom-in view of essential dissection tools. From left to right: broken straight tweezers (two halves), bent tweezers, scalpel, two round spatula tools, and two glass pipettes in the rack smoothened using a Bunsen burner (one with a ~2 mm opening and one with a ~5 mm opening). 2. Decapitation and brain removal: Note: Researchers should receive appropriate training before conducting decapitation and follow the local regulations of the animal welfare body regarding animal experiments. a. Before decapitation, take out the 40 mL GBSS from the freezer and gently shake it, so it becomes “slushy”. Also, take out the 15 mL tube with GBSS from the fridge. Put both tubes on ice. Figure 2 shows the final setup of the decapitation area. Figure 2. Decapitation tools and reagents. The blue-capped tube contains ~40 mL GBSS, which has been in the freezer for 45 min. The white-capped 15 mL tube contains cold GBSS from the fridge. The black metal plate is cooled in the ice bucket and is used during dissection to cool the Petri dish with GBSS. Brain dissection tools from left to right: scalpel, tweezers, scissors, spatula, and a small spoon. The big scissors are used for decapitation. b. Take the mouse pup and quickly decapitate using a pair of sharp scissors. Note: Cup your hands in order to calm the mouse pup before decapitation; make sure there is no ethanol on your gloves. c. After decapitation using the big scissors, use the scalpel to cut the skin on top of the head open across the brain’s midline and fold it to the side/front with tweezers or your fingers. d. Then, use the scissors to cut open the skull from posterior to anterior along the midline. Insert the scissors at lambda or from behind the cerebellum, pull upward slightly to prevent damage to the brain, and then cut the skull open in one go. Fold the skull to the side using tweezers. e. Scoop out the brain using a spatula and put it into the “slushy” GBSS. Let it cool down for 1 min (while cleaning the dissection tools). f. Pour all the GBSS into the big Petri dish with the filter paper and use the small spoon to transfer the brain. Note: Filter paper helps with holding the brain in place whilst performing dissection. 3. Isolating the hippocampus: a. First, cut off the anterior (olfactory bulb and part of the frontal cortex) and posterior (cerebellum) parts of the brain ( Figure 3A ). b. Then, separate the two hemispheres by cutting across the midline ( Figure 3B –3C). c. Put the cold metal block underneath the Petri dish and proceed under the microscope. d. Use the two round spatulas to carefully flip the brain on the anterior part with the cortex (round) side facing away from you. The midbrain is now visible ( Figure 3D ). e. Scoop out the midbrain: insert the spatula at the dotted line ( Figure 3D ) and scoop it out in one motion. Note: If you are not able to scoop out the full midbrain, try to remove the rest with the spatula but prioritize not damaging the hippocampus. Figure 3. Dissection steps of the whole brain to separate hemispheres. A. Dorsal view of the brain. Dotted lines indicate the regions that need to be cut off. B. Dorsal view of the brain after cutting; the dotted line indicates the cut to separate the two hemispheres. C. Left and right hemispheres separated, viewing the midbrain. D. Put the hemispheres on the anterior part; the outside (round) part is the cortex, and the inside part is the midbrain. f. Put the brain down on the cortex so that the hippocampus is facing you ( Figure 4A ). The hippocampus should now be visible as a banana-shaped structure lying on top of the cortex. Cut the left and right sides off so the hippocampus becomes separated from the cortex. Note: Cutting more off the sides makes the hippocampus easier to roll out but reduces the yield of slices. g. “Roll” the hippocampus out and over the cortex using two spatulas. Use one spatula to stabilize the cortex and the other to slide between the cortex and the hippocampus from the side. Flip the hippocampus out and away from you. The hippocampus is still attached to the cortex; cut it loose in one motion using the spatula. Do not cut the cortex too close to the hippocampus, making sure some of the entorhinal cortex is still attached. Perform steps A3d–f for both hippocampi. Notes: 1. When the hippocampus is separated, some fibrous membranes may still be attached to it. Try to carefully remove these with the round side of the bent tweezer. 2. When you need to move the separated hippocampus, always use the glass pipette with the ~5 mm opening to avoid damage. If you have to touch it with tools, only touch the cortex side. Figure 4. From hemisphere to hippocampus. A. The hippocampus is visible as a banana-shaped structure lying against the cortex. Dotted lines indicate where to cut to loosen the hippocampus. B. Hemisphere with hippocampus after cutting. C. Scoop out the hippocampus with the spatulas in one motion. D. View of the hippocampus after rolling it out, with a piece of entorhinal cortex still attached. h. Now, put both hippocampi onto the PVC membrane using the glass pipette ( Figure 5A ). Align the two hippocampi parallel to each other and orthogonal to the razor blade. The thicker, round dorsal side of the hippocampus should preferably be closest to the razor blade so that it will be cut first. Remove any excess GBSS with a 200 μL pipette. i. Use the chopper to make 400 μm vertical slices. j. Fill the small Petri dish with 15 mL cold GBSS. Transfer the PVC membrane with the slices to the Petri dish. Use the tweezers to abruptly push the PVC into the cold GBSS fluid. This will prevent the hippocampal slices from detaching. Note: Some slices may detach from the PVC. In this case, carefully get them to sink back to the bottom by gently dropping a droplet on top of them using the glass pipette with the ~2 mm opening. Figure 5. Making hippocampal slices using the tissue chopper. A. Put the hippocampus with the CA1 region facing upward onto the PVC membrane. Make sure the hippocampus is orthogonal to the razor blade. B. Place the PVC membrane on the chopper. C. View of hippocampal slices under the microscope after cutting on the chopper. k. Separate the hippocampal slices ( Figure 6A ). Enter with one broken tweezer from the side of the entorhinal cortex and hold the slice in place at the hippocampal side; this way, our region of interest (CA1) is not damaged. Make sure to move your tools only in a horizontal direction to minimize touching the slices. l. If a slice has a large entorhinal cortex, make sure to cut this a bit smaller (approximately 1/3 of the size of the hippocampal part; Figure 6B –6C). Slices with too much or too little entorhinal cortex are often of lower quality. Figure 6. Separating and trimming hippocampal slices. A. Separate hippocampal slices using broken tweezer tools. B. Example of a good hippocampal slice before cutting the entorhinal cortex. C. Hippocampal slice after cutting the entorhinal cortex. D. Three good hippocampal slices with cut entorhinal cortices. 4. Plating and maintaining slices: a. Select the best slices for culturing. Pick up one slice into the pipette and release it in a single droplet onto the PTFE membrane in the insert ( Figure 7A –B). Take away excess fluid using a 200 μL pipette without touching the slice ( Figure 7C ). Notes: 1. Sometimes, the slice will float toward the pipette tip when taking away excess fluid. Therefore, place the tip at the cortex side to prevent accidental damage to the CA1. 2. Plating the slices on small membrane cutouts allows easy transfer of the slices from the inserts to the microscope setup. Alternatively, the slices can be placed directly onto the inserts. Figure 7. Plating hippocampal slices. A. Use a pipette to pick up a single hippocampal slice. B. Drop it directly in the middle of a PTFE membrane. C. Remove excess culture medium using a 200 μL pipette. b. Refresh the culture medium the next day: take out the culture insert using sterilized tweezers in a closed flow hood. Aspirate the medium and add 1 mL of fresh culture medium with a sterilized pipette tip. Then, put the insert back into the well. c. From then on, refresh the medium every other day. Note: Refreshing 2 times per week is also sufficient. Slices can be kept in culture for ~4 weeks. Figure 8 shows a representative slice over time. Figure 8. Representative images of a hippocampal slice on different days in vitro (DIV). Slices will look different over time. Right after dissection, hippocampal structures are well visible. As the slice flattens and attaches to the PTFE membrane, its appearance changes. The dark color disappears over time, as damaged cells are cleared, and the slice becomes thinner. Good-quality slices maintain a clear anatomical structure and stable thickness at ~150 μm after DIV10. Scale bar = 250 μm. B. Determine optimal virus concentration Notes: 1. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were prepared in HEK293 cells [16]. For more details on the SClm viruses, we refer readers to Grimley et al. [11] and Peerboom et al. [17]. 2. Alternatively, slices can be prepared from transgenic mice in which SClm is expressed in (a subset of) neurons [14]. This alleviates the need for AAV-mediated transduction. 1. Prepare a range of viral concentrations. a. Dilute the virus in PBS, ensuring that it is kept on ice. Testing a range of viral concentrations is advised. We tested undiluted (titer of 1.12 × 10 12 genomic copies per milliliter), 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:25, and 1:50 virus dilutions. Note: The dilution factor that is used depends not only on viral titer but also on the type of construct (floxed vs. non-floxed). Therefore, we advise always using a dilution range to determine the concentration that gives optimal expression of the SClm sensor. 2. Inject the virus into the CA1 region of the hippocampus. a. Before performing AAV-mediated transduction, refresh with 1 mL of culture medium. b. After pulling a thin-walled glass capillary in a pipette puller, secure it in the micromanipulator holder. c. Before adding the virus to the pipette, cut the tip of the glass pipette using a small pair of scissors under a wide-field microscope. See Figure 9 for the approximate size of the pipette tip opening. Note: Keep the magnification you use (we use 32× magnification) consistent when cutting the pipette tip to minimize the variation of pipette tip openings. Figure 9. AAV injections in organotypic hippocampal slices. The glass capillary is placed between the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus. After applying pressure, a droplet containing virus will form in the middle of the slice. Scale bar = 250 μm. d. Ensure that the microinjector is turned on. Set the injection pressure to ~80 hPa. Note: The exact pressure strength will need to be tuned, as this parameter is also dependent on the size of the capillary opening. e. Take the capillary from its holder and add the virus to the capillary using a 20 μL pipette with a microloader pipette tip. Attach the filled capillary back to the holder. f. Move the capillary toward the slice. Make sure to position the capillary above the slice between the CA1 and the Dentate gyrus when targeting VGAT-Cre cells in the stratum radiatum. When targeting pyramidal cells, injections (of Cre-independent virus) should be performed close to but not in the stratum pyramidale. g. Move the capillary toward the slice until it touches the surface of the slice. You can now inject. A bubble will form on top of the slice. Make sure that the bubble is not too big and that it does not roll off the slice for optimal transfection. Injecting slightly below the cell surface will result in more localized expression. We typically inject at 3–4 locations for optimal results. C. SClm sensor calibration (slightly modified from Grimley et al. [11]) Note: The FRET ratio is dependent on the type of microscope used, its settings, and its filters. Therefore, it is essential that the calibration and imaging of experiments are performed on the same microscope using the same filters and settings. 1. Prepare chloride stocks. a. Prepare high chloride stock, low chloride stock, and KF quenching solution (see Recipes). b. Use the high and low chloride stock to make dilutions containing 0 mM (0 mL of high and 100 mL of low chloride stock), 5 mM (8 mL of high and 92 mL of low chloride stock), 10 mM (16 mL of high and 84 mL of low chloride stock), 50 mM (32 mL of high and 68 mL of low chloride stock), and 161 mM (100 mL of high and 0 mL of low chloride stock) of chloride. Adjust pH to 7.4 if necessary, using NaOH or HCl. 2. Measure SClm FRET signals using ionophore treatment. a. Wash in aCSF containing ionophores (100 μM nigericin and 50 μM tributyltin acetate) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for 20 min. b. Perfuse slices with saline solutions containing 0, 5, 10, 50, and 161 mM of chloride and the ionophores in the abovementioned concentration. Finish by washing in the KF quenching solution (+ ionophores) to maximally quench the SClm sensor. c. Consequently perfuse slices with these solutions, 15 min per solution. Take a Z-stack image every 5 min (see section D). Notes: 1. We experienced highly variable penetrance of nigericin and tributyltin in organotypic hippocampal slices between experiments, probably due to the high cell density and thickness. It is therefore important to monitor SClm responses and make sure FRET signals are stable and reflect equal intra- and extracellular chloride concentration. The FRET ratios in the plateau phase (usually reached after ~10 min) should be used for creating the calibration curve. If possible, perform calibration in dissociated cultures, where ionophores have more direct access to the cells. 2. Slice quality will decrease during ionophore treatment; usually, only 3 or 4 concentrations can be tested per slice. D. Imaging 1. Make ACSF solution (see Recipes) and measure the pH (7.2–7.4) and osmolarity (310 ± 10 mOsmol/L). 2. Perfuse the bath of the two-photon microscope system with 1 mL/min of ACSF heated to 30–32 °C and continuously carbonated (start carbonation 20–30 min before the experiment) with 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 . 3. Transfer a slice into the bath with the CA1 region of the hippocampus facing away from you. 4. Locate the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region of the hippocampus using a 4× objective and zoom in using a 60× water immersion objective. 5. Find cells with good SClm sensor expression. Determine appropriate laser power based on expression levels to minimize bleaching. 6. Image Z-stacks in multiple fields of view (FOVs) in the stratum pyramidale (when imaging pyramidal cells) or the stratum radiatum (when imaging inhibitory interneurons). We usually image 2–4 FOVs per slice. Note: We mainly acquire image stacks at a resolution of 8.1 pixels/μm (1,024  ×  1,024 pixels, 126  ×  126 μm) with 1-μm steps of ∼40–85 μm in depth. If your experiment requires frequent imaging (e.g., every 2 min), the resolution should be decreased (e.g., 4.1 pixels/μm, 512  ×  512 pixels, 126  ×  126 μm) to shorten the image acquisition time.\n\nValidation of protocol The protocol described in this paper was used and validated in the following two papers published by our lab: Herstel et al.

    "title": "Dual-Color Live Imaging of Adult Muscle Stem Cells in the Embryonic Tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.",
    "abstract": "Adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs) show remarkable capability in repairing injured tissues. Studying MuSCs in suitable model organisms, which show strong homology with vertebrate counterparts, helps in dissecting the mechanisms regulating their behavior. Additionally, ease of handling and access to technological tools make model organisms well suited for studying biological processes that are conserved across species. MuSCs quiescence, proliferation, and migration are regulated by various input of signals from the surrounding tissues that constitute the MuSCs niche. Observing MuSCs along with their niche in vivo through live imaging provides key information on how MuSCs behave in quiescent and activated states. Drosophila melanogaster is well known for its genetic tool arsenal and the similarity of its different biological processes with vertebrates. Hence, it is widely used to study different types of stem cells. Gained knowledge could then be extrapolated to the vertebrate/mammalian homologous systems to enhance our knowledge in stem cell fields. In this protocol, we discuss how to perform live cell imaging of Drosophila MuSCs, called adult muscle precursors (AMPs) at embryonic stages, using dual-color labelling to visualize both AMPs and the surrounding tissues. This dual-color fluorescent labelling enables the observation of in vivo behavior of two types of cells simultaneously and provides key information on their interactions. The originality of this protocol resides in its biological application to MuSCs and their niche.",

Prepare apple/grape juice agar medium using methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate according to standard protocols (Cold Spring Harb Protoc, 2011 ), pour it into 35 mm cell culture dishes, and allow the food medium to solidify at room temperature. The plates with medium can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks ( Figure 2A ). Add a layer of yeast paste to the center of the apple juice agar plate before setting up the cage to stimulate the egg production. Allow the flies to mate and start laying eggs in the egg-laying cage for two days in a 25°C incubator with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. Once the flies are synchronized to the cage, the apple juice agar plates can be changed every 12 h to collect embryos with a developmental time point ranging from 0 to 12 h. Alternatively, collect the egg-laying plates by transferring flies to a new egg collection cage every 2 h and incubate separately in a 25°C Drosophila incubator to obtain age-synchronized embryos. Wash the embryos from the plates with a fine brush into a dechorionation chamber; rinse with water repeatedly to remove any traces of yeast paste ( Figure 2B –D). Dechorionate embryos using 50% commercial bleach with continuous swirling of the dechorionation chamber for up to 2 min, until all embryos look like shiny rice granules. At this step, embryos can be observed under the dissection microscope to ensure proper removal of the chorion membrane ( Figure 2E ). Thoroughly rinse the dechorionation chamber with distilled water to remove any traces of bleach; pat dry the embryos by placing the nylon mesh from the dechorionation chamber on a pile of Kleenex tissues for a few minutes ( Figure 2F ). Dechorionated embryos are hygroscopic in nature and tend to stick to each other. After pat drying for 2–3 min, gently pick up the clusters of embryos with a fine brush or dissecting needle; place them on a rectangular block of apple juice agar cut from the square cell culture plates containing a uniform layer of apple/grape juice agar medium ( Figure 2G –H). Embryo alignment and picking onto a coverslip Align the embryos in a linear fashion on the edge of the rectangular agar block. Maintain the orientation of the embryos in such a way that the dorsal side faces the edge of the agar block, and the lateral side faces up to visualize the abdominal AMPs ( Figure 2I ). For other specific tissues or cells, the embryos can be aligned accordingly so they can be visualized easily using an inverted microscope. Place approximately 10 strips of double-sided tape (10 × 1 cm) in a 100 mL glass bottle and fill it with 90 mL of N-heptane. Allow the tape and heptane mixture to sit at room temperature for 12 h for proper extraction of the glue. The heptane/glue solution can be kept at 4 °C and used for several experiments. Using a P10 micropipette, add a small volume of heptane/glue solution to the center of a rectangular coverslip in a thin line that covers the entire coverslip length ( Figure 2J ). Allow the glue to semidry for 5 min in a sterile empty plastic box. Gently press the side containing glue against the aligned embryos on the agar block; this way, the embryos are transferred to the coverslip in the same alignment of the agar block, with the lateral side facing towards the coverslip ( Figure 2K ). This side can be easily visualized with high magnification lenses, which require applying immersion oil to the coverslip. Cover the embryos with a thin layer of halocarbon oil 27 to prevent them from desiccation ( Figure 2L ). Halocarbon oil allows embryos to exchange gases with the surrounding air, keeping them in healthy conditions for a long period. Imaging the embryos with a confocal microscope using time-lapse series Visualize the embryos using an inverted microscope, in which the objectives can touch the bottom side of the coverslip without disturbing the embryos ( Figure 2M ). Place the coverslips in the microscope in the same manner as glass slides using suitable holders. Using the lower magnification eyepiece of a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with time series imaging, select suitable embryos with appropriate developmental stage and better visualization of muscle stem cells and surrounding tissues ( Figure 2N ). Use the 40× oil immersion objective for enlargement of particular hemisegments of the embryo and better observation of the tissues of interest. Select Z-stacks based on the depth of tissue needed to be imaged ( Figure 2O ). Using the Fiji (ImageJ) software, analyze the raw files from the confocal microscope and generate images with the Z-stack of the selected optical section. Using Imaris (BitPlane) software, perform 3D reconstruction of both single time-point image and time-series live imaging.",

    "title": "An Automated Imaging Method for Quantification of Changes to the Endomembrane System in Mammalian Spheroid Models.",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional cell models, such as spheroids, represent a more physiological arrangement in which cells can grow, allowing them to develop cell-cell interactions in all dimensions. The most common methods for growing spheroids are scaffold-based, typically using either extracellular matrix or hydrogels as a physical support for the cellular assembly. One key problem with this approach is that the spheroids that are produced can be highly variable in size and shape. The protocol presented here allows for the systematic production of uniform spheroids in a short time frame by utilising a micropatterned plate. We show that spheroids can be used to investigate fundamental research questions, such as how the endomembrane system is organised in cells. Our protocol can be used in a manual or automated manner, potentially allowing scaling up for screening applications. Furthermore, without the complication of removing the spheroids from the extracellular matrix or hydrogel, as would be required in scaffold-based systems, spheroids can easily be used in other downstream applications. Key features • This work builds upon the method developed by Monjaret et al. [1] and establishes a robust method to produce spheroids from HeLa Kyoto cells. • This protocol generates consistent populations of spheroids that can be used to investigate organelle biology and membrane trafficking pathways. • Entire spheroids can be analysed in a volumetric manner. • This method can be used in both manual and automated pipelines, thereby facilitating use in high-throughput and high-content screens.",

CYTOO plates 96RW custom fibronectin-coated, DC45/P300 (CYTOO, catalog number: 20-950-10); store at 4 °C\n\nProcedure In this protocol, we grow spheroids using CYTOO plates. The particular CYTOO plate used here has a disc micropattern diameter of 45 μm and a pitch between each disc micropattern of 300 μm. Such plates can be custom-designed with various micropattern diameters and pitch sizes depending on the cells grown and the application. The disc micropatterns are coated with fibronectin to improve cell adherence. A. Preparation of plates 1. Take out the CYTOO plate from the fridge and warm it up at RT in the Class II biological safety cabinet for 1 h. Note: While the plate is warming up, you can prepare the cells for plating. 2. After 1 h, add 100 μL of complete medium (see Recipes) into the well. 3. Incubate the plate in the humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for at least 10 min. Note: After this incubation, the plate is ready for cell plating. B. Preparation of cells for plating In this protocol, HeLa Kyoto cells are used to grow spheroids on CYTOO plates. However, the following protocol can be applied to any cell line that can be grown as spheroids using other methods. For a different cell line, the adhesion molecule, number of cells seeded, and number of growth days need to be optimised. All the media and trypsin used for the cell culture should be warmed up to 37 °C in the water bath prior to use. 1. When the cells reach 80% confluency in a 10 cm culture dish, approximating 4 million cells (in 12 mL complete medium), wash them with 2 mL of 1× PBS. Using the Vacuboy, aspirate the PBS off and add 3 mL of fresh 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Put the cells into the humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 and incubate for 3–4 min. 2. When the cells are detached, add 7 mL of complete medium. Wash the cell culture dish to fully detach the cells. Transfer the 10 mL of cell suspension into a 50 mL conical tube. Pipette the cell suspension up and down to produce a homogenous suspension. Note: For this protocol, HeLa Kyoto (parental) and HeLa Kyoto cells stably expressing EGFP, EGFP-Rab5A, or EGFP-Rab6A were used. Parental HeLa Kyoto cells were grown in complete medium (see Recipe 1), and HeLa Kyoto cells stably expressing EGFP, EGFP-Rab5A, or EGFP-Rab6A were grown in complete medium containing 700 μg/mL G418 (see Recipe 2). 3. Pipette 1 mL of cell suspension into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for cell counting. 4. Turn on the Scepter cell counter and insert the 60 μm sensor into it. Then, insert the sensor into the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the cell suspension and count the number of cells. Note: A hemocytometer counting chamber or other automated cell counting equipment can also be used to count the number of cells. 5. Calculate the total number of cells in your cell suspension by multiplying the number of cells counted by the Scepter times 10. 6. Centrifuge the cells at 135× g for 4 min at RT. 7. Carefully aspirate the supernatant with the Vacuboy and add the appropriate amount of complete medium to the cell pellet to create a cell suspension of 1 × 10 6 cells/mL. Resuspend the cell pellet in complete medium. 8. Preparation of cell suspension: plate 5,000 cells per well in 100 μL of complete medium into each well of the CYTOO plate. For this, 5 μL of the 1 × 10 6 cells/mL cell suspension is mixed with 95 μL of complete medium. Prepare sufficient cell suspension for each cell line for plating (either in a microcentrifuge tube or a conical tube). Note: To prepare sufficient cell suspension for plating, the following formula was used: number of wells + 5 wells. If you are using automated cell plating equipment (e.g., a Multidrop), you should add 10% extra wells. Pause point: Cells can be kept in the tube in the Class II biological safety cabinet until the plate is ready to use. 9. Plating of cells into the plate: Carefully pipette the cell suspension created in step B8 up and down to create a homogenous cell suspension. Pipette 100 μL of cell suspension into each well containing 100 μL of complete medium (see section A) by placing the pipette tip over the middle of the well and carefully releasing the cell suspension. Note: For large-scale spheroid production, this step can be carried out with automated cell plating equipment (e.g., a Multidrop). 10. Place the plate into a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Let the cells grow into spheroids for 3 days. Monitor the spheroid growth with a light microscope over the 3 days. Note: Initial cell adhesion to the micropattern can be checked after 1 h. Non-attached cells can be gently washed off with a medium exchange the following day by removing 150 μL of complete medium and replacing it with 150 μL of fresh complete medium. Repeat the wash 2–3 times. The number of growth days depends on the cell line used and the desired size of the spheroids. For longer periods of growth, it is recommended to exchange the medium every two days, as described for the well wash above. C. Immunostaining of spheroids For this part of the protocol, it is important to be gentle with the spheroids. Always use an electronic 8-channel pipette to aspirate and dispense liquids from/to the well at the slowest pipetting speed. The plate is always covered with aluminium foil for the incubation periods in order to minimise exposure of the fluorophores to light. If all wells in the plates are used, these steps can be carried out with pipetting robots (e.g., Viaflo 96). The PBS used to produce the primary and secondary antibody solutions, as well as for the washes, does not necessarily need to be autoclaved. 1. Remove the media from the wells. 2. Add 100 μL of 3% PFA (see Recipe 14) and incubate for 1 h at RT. 3. Quench with 100 μL of 30 mM glycine in PBS for 30 min. 4. Wash the spheroids twice with PBS. Pause point: You can pause the spheroid staining here and continue within a few days. Store the plate at 4 °C. 5. Permeabilise the spheroids with 100 μL of 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at RT. 6. Wash the spheroids twice with PBS. 7. Incubate the spheroids with 100 μL of primary antibody solution in PBS for 2 h at RT. For this, prepare a fresh primary antibody solution by pipetting the primary antibody and 0.02% sodium azide in the appropriate volume of PBS. The rabbit anti-GM130 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:500, and the mouse anti-EEA1 and mouse anti-LAMP1 antibodies were used at 1:200. Note: The dilution depends on the specific antibody used. The dilution of the anti-LAMP1 antibody may vary depending on the supernatant batch. Test new batches before usage. Use the stock of sodium azide (see Recipe 9) to produce a final concentration of 0.02% sodium azide. Alternatively, antibody incubation can be carried out overnight at RT or 4 °C. 8. Wash the spheroids twice with PBS. 9. Incubate the spheroids with 100 μL of secondary antibody solution in PBS for 2 h at RT. For this, prepare a fresh solution by pipetting the secondary antibody, 0.2 μg/mL Hoechst 33342, and 0.02% sodium azide in the appropriate volume of PBS. The secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 were used at a dilution of 1:400. Note: The antibody dilution depends on the specific antibody used. Highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies that show high photostability and high brightness are recommended. Use the Hoechst 33342 stock (see Recipe 4) and sodium azide (Recipe 9) to produce a final concentration of 0.2 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 and 0.02% sodium azide, respectively. Alternatively, antibody incubation can be carried out overnight at RT or 4 °C. 10. Wash the spheroids twice with PBS. 11. Store the plates at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil. Note: Image the spheroids within 2 weeks to achieve a good fluorescent signal strength. D. Drug inhibitor assay in spheroids Two common inhibitors of membrane trafficking events can be used to show the applicability of spheroids in studying membrane trafficking events. Again, all tests should be carried out using an electronic 8-channel pipette to aspirate and dispense liquids from/to the well at the slowest pipetting speed. For plates in which all wells have been used, these steps can be carried out with pipetting robots (e.g., Viaflo 96). 1. First, freshly prepare the BFA (final concentration 10 μg/mL) and nocodazole (final concentration 7.5 μM) solutions in prewarmed complete medium. Note: To prepare the solutions, use the stock solutions of BFA (see Recipe 10) and nocodazole (see Recipe 11). 2. Remove the medium from the spheroid-containing wells/plate. 3. Add 100 μL of drug solution (either BFA or nocodazole). 4. Incubate the spheroids for 30 min at 37 °C in the humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . 5. Continue with the fixation and immunofluorescence protocol as described in section C.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: • Mysior and Simpson [22]. An automated high-content screening and assay platform for the analysis of spheroids at subcellular resolution. PLoS One , 19(11), e0311963. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311963 In the supplementary information in this article, readers will also find seven supplementary tables detailing, step-by-step, seven different image analysis pipelines. These use the commercial imaging analysis software Harmony that is provided with Opera Phenix microscope. In general, approximately 90% of micropatterns were occupied by cells shortly after seeding. After 3 days of growth, approximately 60%–80% of the micropatterns contained spheroids [22]. At this point, using a pre-scan function on the microscope, spheroids with particular size characteristics can be selected for higher resolution imaging. Using this approach, primary characterisation of the spheroids showed that each had a similar average area, and that this was also consistent between the different cell lines (see Figure 1C in [22]). Furthermore, the average spheroid volume (Figure 2B in [22]) and the number of nuclei per spheroid (Figure 2D in [22]) were in the same range for all cell lines. The overexpression of some proteins, particularly those that play a role in cell division or assembly of the plasma membrane, can result in changes to spheroid size and other properties. For example, we found that spheroids overexpressing EGFP-Rab6A were on average 20% smaller than the other spheroids (Figure 2A, D in [22]). However, a key advantage of this method is that several hundred spheroids can be generated per well, compared to more commonly used methods such as U-bottomed ULA plates and hanging drop methods, which typically produce only one spheroid per well or drop. Other methods that produce large numbers of spheroids per well, for example, through the use of extracellular matrix, result in a much higher heterogeneity of spheroid size, with typical size differences being more than 10-fold in a single fold [18,23]. The small, but relatively uniform size of the spheroids produced in the current protocol allowed for the acquisition of volumetric information from various organelles of the endomembrane system (see Figures 3, S2, and S2 in [22]). Quantitative subcellular information from the spheroids was extracted from the Golgi apparatus, early endosomes, and lysosomes. Various parameters, such as the volume of the organelle, its surface area, and the number of fragments or distinct organelles, can be extracted from the images. Quantitative analysis of the Golgi volume in cells grown as spheroids measured approximately 125 μm 3 (see Figure 3E in [22]). The total volume occupied by early endosomes and lysosomes in the cell was 120 and 30 μm 3 , respectively (see Figures S2E and S3E in [22]). These examples demonstrate the potentially rich quantitative information that can be extracted from individual cells in spheroids. This approach could, in principle, be easily adapted for most other subcellular structures. Furthermore, in the work on which this protocol is based, we were also able to conduct widely used functional assays in the field of membrane trafficking using the spheroid model, namely BFA and nocodazole treatment, to provide proof-of-principle data. A reduction in Golgi volume, together with an increase in the number of Golgi fragments per cell after BFA and nocodazole treatment, respectively, could be measured (see Figures 4C, D and S4C, D in [22]). Alongside changes to organelles, we were able to quantify changes in the EGFP-Rab5A and EGFP-Rab6A patterns in cells grown as spheroids after BFA and nocodazole-induced treatments, respectively, utilising, for example, texture features (see Figures 5 and S5 in [22]). Again, this demonstrates the potentially wide applicability of the protocol detailed here.",

    "abstract": "Most viruses extensively remodel their host cells to establish productive infection. Visualization of virus-induced cellular remodeling by electron microscopy (EM) has been revolutionized in recent years by advances in cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling paired with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). As cryo-FIB/ET becomes more widely available, there is a need for beginner-friendly guides to optimize the preparation of virus-infected mammalian cells on EM grids. Here, we provide an in-house protocol for new users for preparing samples of cells infected with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) for cryo-FIB/ET. This protocol guides users in how to seed infected cells onto grids, blot, and plunge-freeze grids using basic, manual equipment. It also provides tips on how to screen and prioritize grids for efficient milling and data collection. Key features • A beginner-friendly protocol for users without access to a cryo-EM core/suite at their institution that utilizes basic equipment. • This protocol focuses on optimizing cell seeding and blotting to yield grids with thin ice and evenly distributed cells. • Grids prepared using this protocol can be used for focused ion beam milling.",

Prepare and infect cells Note: Before handling grids, the virus and cells must be ready for use. This requires that the virus be titrated and aliquoted at a known titer; our purification and titration protocol is adapted from [21]. Viral titer must be measured as plaque-forming units per milliliter of stock (PFU/mL). This protocol assumes competence in tissue culture and general cell handling techniques. In this section, you will seed two plates (steps A1–2), determine the number of cells per plate and calculate virus required for infection (steps A3–12), infect cells (steps A13–14), allow virus to adhere for 1 h (step A15), and remove the virus and allow infection to proceed in the incubator (step A16–17). 1. Prepare two 10-cm dishes with cells. This allows you to use one dish for cell counting before infection. Each dish should be seeded with 2.2 × 10 6 cells in 12 mL of complete DMEM (see Recipe 1). Note: Cells should be at least one passage and less than six passages after thawing. Caution: All work with cells and viruses should be carried out following BSL2 safety practices inside a biosafety cabinet. 2. Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 12–18 h. 3. The next day, confirm that the cells are at least 80% confluent in the dish. 4. Aspirate media from one plate and rinse with 7 mL of PBS by gently pipetting over cells and aspirating. 5. Add 5 mL of trypsin and incubate the dish at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 5 min until all cells are detached and floating in media. 6. Add 5 mL of complete DMEM to the dish and pipette up and down to break up cell clumps and release cells from the dish. 7. Pipette 25 μL of cells into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. 8. Mix 75 μL of trypan blue with 25 μL of cell suspension. 9. Pipette 10 μL of this cell mixture into a hemocytometer. 10. Count the number of live (i.e., not trypan blue–positive) cells in each of the four border squares (also called 16 squares) and multiply by 10,000 to calculate the number of cells per milliliter in the solution. The factor of 10,000 corrects for the volume in the Neubauer grid, 1 × 10 -4 mL. Multiply this value by 10 to determine the number of cells in the starting dish; this adjusts for the starting volume of 10 mL. Template calculation: # l i v e c e l l s × 10,000 × 10 = t o t a l n u m b e r o f c e l l s i n d i s h 11. Calculate necessary volumes for infecting cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI; PFU/cell) of 5 using the known titer of your virus stock (PFU/mL). For accuracy, 1.5× of the total requisite volume is prepared. a. Media calculation: 1.5 × # p l a t e s t o b e i n f e c t e d × 2 m L = m L s e r u m - f r e e D M E M r e q u i r e d b. Virus calculation: 1.5 × # C e l l s × M O I V i r u s T i t e r = m L v i r u s r e q u i r e d Caution: For best BSL2 practice, remove all unnecessary equipment from the TC hood before introducing the virus. Prepare a beaker with 20% bleach for all tips and waste (see Recipe 2). 12. Prepare the virus mixture. In a 15-mL tube, mix the volume of serum-free DMEM calculated in step A11a with the volume of viral stock calculated in step A11b. 13. Aspirate the media from the remaining 10-cm dish. 14. Pipette 2 mL of the virus mixture from step A12 onto the infection dish. 15. Place the 10-cm dish into a 15-cm dish and place both into a 4 °C fridge for 1 h, gently rocking by hand every 15 min. Note: Infected cells are placed into a 15-cm dish to serve as secondary containment in the communal fridge and incubator. 16. After 1 h, aspirate the virus gently and add 12 mL of complete DMEM. Note: This marks the start of the infection. 17. Return the cells to the incubator and allow infection to proceed. B. Grid preparation and seeding Note: In this section, you will glow-discharge and treat grids (steps B1–7 and B18–21), calculate the density of infected cells (steps B8–17), and incubate grids with cells (steps B22–27). Critical: Grid preparation must be started by 8 hpi or 4 h before the infection time point. 1. Place 4–8 grids, mesh side up, onto the glow-discharge holder. Glow-discharge grids for 120 s at 30 mA with negative charge. Note: While users should determine their own grid handling efficiency, we recommend starting with four to six grids because one or two grids will likely be broken during handling or freezing. Users should avoid trying to freeze more grids at a time because liquid nitrogen and ethane accumulate ice and evaporate over time. Caution : Always use gloves when handling components that enter the glow-discharge chamber. Critical : Glow-discharging the grids is required for successful cell adherence. This process renders the EM grid mesh surface hydrophilic for sample addition. 2. Place glow-discharged grids into a 10-cm dish to transfer them from the glow discharger to the tissue culture hood. Notes: 1. Static between the grids and the tissue culture dish can pose an issue. Using antistatic guns against the bottom of the tissue culture dish may help reduce static charge. Alternatively, lightly wiping the bottom of the dish with 70% ethanol on a Kimwipe can help. 2. Think about how you will remove the grids from the dish before placing them—provide adequate space for the tweezers to reach each grid. 3. Prepare poly-l-lysine (PLL) solution (see Recipe 3). Note: Always freshly prepare the PLL before use. PLL promotes cell adhesion to the grid. 4. Pipette 20 μL of PLL solution onto each grid, forming a dome over the mesh. 5. Cover the dish with a lid and place the grids under UV light for 30 min. 6. Prepare a “cleaning plate” to rinse the grids after PLL treatment. Place 50 μL droplets of complete DMEM (see Recipe 1) onto a 10-cm plate in an array. Prepare three droplets per grid (i.e., 12 total droplets for 4 grids). 7. Prepare an 8-well chamber slide by pipetting 50 μL of complete DMEM (see Recipe 1) into each well. Notes: 1. Different conditions cannot be included in the same 8-well chamber slide, as the contents of the 8 wells are mixed in section D (due to the removal of the upper chamber). Use separate slides for different conditions. 2. Handle the chamber gently to maintain the droplet integrity. The droplet height assists with depositing the grid. 8. Remove infected cells from the incubator (step A17) at 9 hpi and confirm infection by TdTomato signal. Note: At least 70% of cells should be positive for fluorescent signal. In the absence of a fluorescent reporter, observing cytopathic effects (i.e., the rounding up of cells) can be used to confirm infection. Critical: Cells must be prepared at 9 hpi or 3 h before the infection time point. Caution: Before placing infected plates into the hood, remove excess materials and place a beaker with 20% bleach (see Recipe 2) inside for BSL2 inactivation. 9. Aspirate the media and rinse gently with 5 mL of PBS. Caution: Infected cells are much more fragile than uninfected cells. Set the pipettor to the lowest setting and be careful when aspirating liquid. 10. Aspirate the PBS. Add 5 mL of trypsin to the dish and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 5 min. 11. Following trypsinization, add 5 mL of complete DMEM to the dish and carefully pipette up and down to break up cell clumps and release cells from the dish. 12. Pre-wet a 40-μm cell filter membrane with 1 mL of complete DMEM and place it into a 50-mL Falcon tube. 13. Slowly pipette resuspended cells through the filter. Dispose of the filter in 20% bleach. 14. Pipette 25 μL of filtered cells into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. 15. Mix 75 μL of trypan blue with the 25 μL of filtered-cell suspension. 16. Pipette 10 μL of this cell mixture into a cell counting slide. Count the total number of live cells from all four border squares and multiply by 10,000 to calculate the number of cells per milliliter in the solution. Multiply by 10 to determine the number of cells in the starting dish. 17. Dilute cells to 1 × 10 4 cells/mL with complete DMEM into 5 mL of total volume. 18. Prepare your workspace (see Figure 1 ). Make a place for the PLL-treated grids on the far-left side of the hood, place the “cleaning plate” centrally, and the 8-well chamber slide on the right (for right-handed users). Elevating plates and chamber slides on tip boxes or a stack of 4-way racks can help improve grid handling, especially for taller users. 19. Upon completion of the 30-min UV treatment (from step B5), rinse grids by gently passing them through three droplets of complete DMEM. Ensure minimal contact between the tweezers and the droplet. 20. Place the cleaned grid on top of the 50-μL droplet in the chamber slide. 21. Repeat steps B19–20 for all grids. 22. Resuspend the cell mixture (from step B17) by gently pipetting up and down. 23. Add 150 μL of cells to the grid and 50 μL of complete DMEM to one well and bring it to the microscope. 24. Allow cells to settle for 5 min, then observe the number of cells sitting in wells by eye. 25. Adjust the cell density such that approximately every square receives 1–2 cells. Notes: 1. If the cell mixture is too dense, start with half of the starting cell density and observe if the number of cells reduced corresponds with a 2-fold reduction in cell density. 2. To help gauge the cell density, use old or bad grids with the same mesh count to avoid wasting grids. Critical: Achieving good cell density is critical, as too high cell density will cause grids to be too thick, whereas too low cell density will not yield enough targets for milling. Sufficient cell density will need to be optimized by each user by screening using SEM. 26. Prepare the rest of the grids with the optimized cell density. 27. Place the 8-well chamber into a 10-cm dish and return to the incubator to allow cells to adhere for 2 h. Note: The time for cell adherence is cell-type specific. Monitor cells under the microscope every 30 min to observe if cells have lost their roundedness and have begun attaching to grids. Critical: Cell adherence and survival on grids is critical for the success of the protocol. See Troubleshooting. Figure 1. Recommended workplace organization for grid seeding. To optimize efficiency with grid handling, organizing the three plates in the hood from left to right—treated grids, cleaning plate, and 8-well chamber—is recommended. The “treated grids” plate contains grids that are arranged at the center of the plate for easy tweezer access. The “cleaning plate” contains an equally spaced grid of droplets of complete DMEM, three per grid. The “8-well chamber” slide is prepared with droplets of media in each well, which provide a pedestal to lay grids on before applying cells. C. Preparation for plunge freezing and grid clipping Note: Setting up an ergonomic workspace around the manual plunge freezer is critical for successful plunge freezing. Before starting the procedure, it is highly recommended to review available video protocols for setting up [12–14] and operating the manual plunge freezer [15]. 1. Test the distance of the tension cable. A firm press on the foot pedal should release the arm. Once the appropriate distance between the foot pedal and the plunge freezer is established, tape down the foot pedal to the floor and the base of the plunge freezer to the bench top. 2. Center the vitrification dewar under the plunge freezer arm. Test the height of the arm with damaged or otherwise disposable tweezers. After adjusting the height, place fresh lab tape onto the post that holds the tweezers. Note: Grids should be fully submerged below the lip of the brass cup, but the tweezers should enter ethane as little as possible. Verify the height 3–4 times, ensuring a quick depression of the foot pedal plunges the tweezers toward the center of the brass cup. 3. Prepare auto-rings by coloring engraved dots and beam divot. These markings facilitate orienting grids for FIB-SEM. See Figure 2 . 4. Prepare blotting paper by tearing P4 filter paper into 3–4 long strips. Note: We recommend tearing the filter paper, instead of using scissors, because tearing generates the rough, fibrous edges that help wick the liquid from the back of the grid. 5. Load C-clips into C-clip tools. Use a thicker tweezer to pick up the C-clip at the curve of the C. Turn the C-clip tool so the opening faces you. Press the C-clip into the tool. Using a smaller tweezer, push the edge of the C so that it is turned flat against the tool opening. 6. Gently place the C-clip tool against a clean, flat surface and press down firmly. Check that the C-clip is flush against the edge. Break point : The protocol can be paused here until the user is ready to start section D. Start section D no later than 30 min before the cells are ready to go. Figure 2. Annotation of FIB-SEM auto-ring. The focused ion beam–scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) used for screening and milling requires the grid to be clipped into a designated auto-ring. On the top face of the ring, there are four visible engravings. Two single dots are opposed. Mark the top face and edge of the ring at each dot with a blue permanent marker. Situated 90° between the single dots lies an engraved divot, through which the FIB beam passes, and a pair of dots. Color the divot with red permanent marker. D. Plunge freezing Note: Wearing a surgical mask while working with liquid nitrogen and ethane can help minimize water contamination. All equipment and tools (i.e., tweezers, screwdriver tips, grid boxes) should be pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen before use. Caution: Working with liquid nitrogen and liquid ethane requires specialized training. As liquid nitrogen and liquid ethane can potentially be dangerous, personal protective equipment (i.e., cryo-gloves, lab coats, and protective glasses) should be used. Coordinate with your local Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) office and review safe handling guidance [16]. 1. When 30 min remain in the infection time course (i.e., 11.5 hpi), fill two 4-L dewars with liquid nitrogen. 2. Fill a foam dewar with liquid nitrogen and use it to cool a 50-mL Falcon tube and rack. Replenish liquid nitrogen levels until all components have reached the temperature of liquid nitrogen (i.e., when bubbling has stopped). 3. Under the fume hood, condense ethane. Empty and secure the cooled 50-mL Falcon tube in the rack. Place the ethane tubing with a pipette tip against the side of the Falcon tube. Slowly open the ethane gas and regulate to ~5 PSI or lower. Caution: Liquid ethane is flammable and will burn skin on contact. Work with EHS to prepare your workstation to be as safe as possible. Note: You must use a separate foam dewar from the vitrification dewar described in step D5. 4. Gently move the tip of the ethane tubing along the side of the Falcon tube and listen for the sounds of liquid splashing. Check that the tip does not freeze solid. Stop the flow when at least 10 mL of liquid ethane has condensed. Cover the tube with a lid, but do NOT close the lid. Store condensed ethane in the foam dewar with liquid nitrogen until ready for use. Caution: When condensing ethane, the ethane can solidify at the end of the tip where gas is released. This will stop gas flow and cause pressure buildup in the tubing. If gas stops flowing, turn off the flow and remove the tip from the vapor phase so it can thaw. 5. Place 1–2 hybrid grid boxes within the vitrification dewar and note their numbers and colors for sample tracking. See Figure 3A for assistance in identifying the metal parts within the vitrification dewar. 6. Chill the vitrification dewar, including the brass cup, metal spider, and grid boxes, with liquid nitrogen. 7. When all metal parts reach liquid nitrogen temperature (i.e., no boiling occurs), fill the outer ring of the vitrification dewar with liquid nitrogen to the top of the metal grid box holder. Ensure the brass cup no longer contains liquid nitrogen. Notes: 1. Using Styrofoam cups can help with pouring small volumes of liquid nitrogen. 2. If a small volume of liquid nitrogen remains in the brass cup, the back end of a warm, dry pair of tweezers can be used to boil it off. 8. Carefully transfer the liquid ethane from the 50-mL Falcon tube into the brass cup in the center of the vitrification dewar. Pour slowly, as vapor obscures the view, to avoid overfilling the brass cup. Note: Ethane will freeze solid when left in liquid nitrogen. Gently swirl the tube to promote thawing before pouring into the brass cup. 9. Replenish the liquid nitrogen level as needed and place a lid over the vitrification dewar. Allow the ethane to cool to the temperature for 5 min. 10. While the ethane cools, prepare a beaker for BSL2 waste. Using stacked tip boxes, elevate the 8-well chamber slide to a good working height. Place the 8-well chamber slide inside a 10-cm dish to manage any spills. Caution: Follow BSL2 procedures when working with virus-infected cells. 11. Crack the upper casing off the 8-well chamber slide, keeping the rubber edging if possible. 12. Check the ethane for frosting along the edges of the cup. The sides of the brass cup should appear frosted. Do not let the ethane freeze over the top of the brass cup, however. Break up any frozen ethane with dry tweezers. Replenish liquid nitrogen levels as necessary. 13. With tweezers, pick up the edge of a grid, using the footprint of the wells or the curve of the meniscus to assist. Be careful not to damage the grid mesh. Critical: When handling grids, be careful to lift them cell-side up. 14. Place the tweezers on the bench with the grid facing cell-side up. Pipette 5 μL of the supernatant media onto the grid. Note: We have found that adding 5 μL of media helps with blotting consistency. 15. Carefully tape the tweezers onto the manual plunger, with the cell side of the grid oriented toward you. Ensure the tweezers are centered above the ethane cup. 16. Blot the grid from behind, on the non-cell side (see Figure 3C ). To do this, bend a thin strip of filter paper toward the grid and slowly bring it toward the grid until it contacts the droplet of media. Hold the paper until the water tension between the grid and the paper breaks. Critical: Blotting by eye rather than time has a significant impact on grid quality. If any media remains visible after the water tension between the media droplet and filter paper breaks, or if a hand movement pulls the paper away from the grid, gently tap the grid corner with the edge of a piece of filter paper (~2 s). Caution: Used filter paper should be discarded in the BSL2 waste. 17. Quickly, but gently, tap the floor pedal to plunge the tweezers into the liquid ethane. Critical: Move carefully and quickly to prevent cells from drying once removed from media. 18. Holding the tweezers steady in one hand and keeping the grid submerged in liquid ethane, detach the tweezers from the post by peeling back the tape. 19. Slowly raise the grid, forming a convex meniscus of liquid ethane around the grid. 20. Quickly lift the grid and move it into the liquid nitrogen in the outer ring of the vitrification dewar. 21. Gently place the grid into a grid box with the cell side facing the notch of the box. 22. Submerge the tweezers in 100% ethanol and dry. 23. Repeat steps D12–22 for each grid, replenishing the liquid nitrogen and ethane levels as necessary. To keep the ethane cup frosted during plunge-freezing, replenish liquid nitrogen as needed.

In red is the grid box holder. (i) central brass cup; (ii) outer ring of the vitrification dewar, which should be filled with liquid nitrogen. (B) Another view of the vitrification dewar. The outer ring contains liquid nitrogen, covering the metal grid box holder. Two grid boxes are visible on the holder. The brass cup is held in the center and contains well-frosted (i.e., properly cooled) ethane. (C) Workspace setup highlighting a well-positioned light source in the upper-left-hand corner and tweezers positioned centrally over the ethane cup with the cells facing the user. The inset shows a blotting technique with curved blotting paper approaching the grid back. E. Grid clipping Note: This protocol was optimized for the NanoSoft clipping station (see Equipment). A video from the manufacturer is available to guide use [17]. Wearing a surgical mask while working with liquid nitrogen and ethane can help minimize water contamination. All equipment and tools should be pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen before use. After being removed from liquid nitrogen, each tool must be dried completely before being re-submerged into the liquid nitrogen. Caution: Working with liquid nitrogen requires specialized training. As liquid nitrogen can potentially be dangerous, personal protective equipment (i.e., cryo-gloves, lab coats, and protective glasses) should be used. Coordinate with your local Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) office. 1. Replenish the liquid nitrogen level in the vitrification dewar and cover with a lid. 2. Chill the clipping station dewar, with all metal parts, including clipping pens, placed inside. Ensure the left side of the flipping mechanism is closest to the metal base. Continuously replenish the liquid nitrogen level until all boiling stops and the liquid level reaches the bottom of the metal components. 3. Transfer grid boxes from the vitrification dewar into the clipping station dewar using a pre-cooled pin-lid manipulator tool. 4. Using the pin-lid manipulator tool, unscrew the grid box lid and then screw the lid into the neighboring hole to stabilize the grid box in place. 5. Place an auto-grid ring colored-side down into the shallow hole. 6. Lift a single grid from the grid box and place it cell-side down into the ring. Note: Clipping in the vapor phase (i.e., where the metal base is not submerged in liquid nitrogen) can help with maneuvering the grids from the clipping indentation to the box because the grids will float in liquid nitrogen. 7. Carefully, press the auto-grid tweezers into the right side of the cantilever beam to shift the guidance cylinder over the grid. Note: You should not face any resistance at this stage. If you feel resistance, the grid is bent or out of alignment with the ring. 8. Lower a clipping pen into the hole and press it down. Firmly press the top of the clipping pen once to release the clip. 9. Remove the clipping pen. Using the auto-grid tweezers, flip the stage back to the open position. 10. Using the auto-grid tweezers, lift the clipped grid and place it in the test divot. Flip the grid back and forth three times to confirm its integrity. If the ring and grid stay together, return the clipped grid to the auto-grid side of the grid box. If the ring and grid fall apart, the clip was not properly inserted. Redo the clipping. Note: To prevent damage to the grid, use auto-grid tweezers to clamp the entire clipped grid. As the auto grid rings are wider than the grid itself, this technique allows for easy grid handling. 11. Repeat steps E5–10 for each grid. 12. Pre-cool a cryo-EM grid storage puck in liquid nitrogen. 13. Using a pre-cooled screwdriver, lower the screw (located above the grid box slot #3) to rotate the clear lid. 14. Using a pre-cooled pin-lid manipulator tool, screw the lid onto the grid box and then transfer the grid box into a slot in the cryo-EM grid storage puck. Repeat this step as necessary for all grid boxes to store. 15. Use the screwdriver to rotate the clear lid back and secure the screw above the grid box slot #3. Transfer the cryo-EM grid storage pucks into a cane within a storage dewar. F. Grid screening Note: The Aquilos cryo-FIB-SEM dual-beam is the best tool for evaluating grids before milling. Users must follow facility-specific instructions for microscope preparation, alignment, and loading/unloading. 1. Following microscope cooling/purging and loading, navigate to Grid 1 in the microscope xT software. 2. Adjust the electron beam to 5 kV and 25 pA and the lowest magnification. 3. Use live view to quickly obtain a snapshot of the grid. Double-click at the grid center to move the stage to center the grid. 4. Apply a reduced view and adjust the focus on the visible grid mesh, slowly increasing the zoom until the edges of the mesh holes are crisp. 5. Set the working height by selecting Link Z to FWD. 6. Return to low magnification and launch Maps from the xT software. 7. Take a snapshot of the grid in Maps. 8. Add a tile set with high voltage (5 kV) selected and 1 µs dwell time. Select auto-focus, auto-contrast, and brightness on the first tile. 9. Overlay the tile set such that the center of the grid is covered, but do not collect the outermost squares, as these are not accessible to the FIB beam or on TEM. Confirm the first grid square is adequate for auto-focusing and contrast (i.e., free of ice or deformations). 10. Press Start to run the tile set. 11. Recenter on Grid 2 and repeat. 12. Assess grids for quality. Good grids should contain (1) visible mesh, (2) minimal grid distortion/bending, (3) 1–2 cells per grid square in the region >3 squares from the edge, and (4) hydrated cells (i.e., maintain appropriate height, 10–20 μm) but with minimal buffer around their footprint. Note: Grid bars are trapezoidal and extend below the mesh. Therefore, cells are best situated >5 μm from the visible bar.\n\nValidation of protocol Out of 12 grids prepared using this protocol, 9 grids yielded lamellae for data collection. Each grid contained between 4 and 14 lamellae. Lamella were milled following published protocols [20]. To demonstrate the applicability of this protocol, we have also shown that this protocol works for infected Vero and HeLa cells ( Figure 4B ). Figure 4. Grids were successfully prepared with Vero and HeLa cell types for efficient milling. (A) Grid prepared with Vero cells, where each teal target indicates a cell successfully milled. This represents the upper end of grid seeding density with 14 lamellae generated. Scale bar, 250 μm. The inset shows a magnification, showing two cells near the grid center. (B) A successfully prepared grid of HeLa cells, representing the lower end of grid seeding density. Cells that are well placed for milling are indicated by orange circles. Scale bar, 1,000 μm.

    "title": "Electroporation of Whole-Mount Postnatal Rodent Retinas for Advanced Functional Assays.",
    "abstract": "To study gene function in regulating rodent retinal waves during development, an efficient method for gene delivery into whole-mount retinas is required while preserving circuit functionality for physiological studies. We present an optimized electroporation protocol for developing rodent retinal explants. The procedure includes the fabrication of horizontally aligned platinum electrodes and the placement of retinal explants between them to generate a uniform electric field for high transfection efficiency. The entire process-dissection and electroporation-can be completed within 1-2 h. Successful transfection is verified by fluorescence microscopy, and physiological assays such as patch-clamp recordings and live imaging can be performed within 1-4 days following electroporation. This rapid and reliable protocol enables functional analysis for a specific gene in regulating retinal waves and can be adapted to other organotypic slice cultures. Key features • Incorporates horizontally aligned platinum electrodes and enables cell type-specific promoters to drive gene expression for physiological studies. • Preserves retinal wave activity while markedly improving transfection efficiency in whole-mount postnatal rodent retinas. • Requires only 1-2 h from retinal dissection to electroporation. • Allows completion of functional experiments within four days after electroporation.",

Preparation of platinum electrodes (see Figure 1 ) To prepare the electrodes for electroporation of retinal explants, create two separate devices: one for the positive electrode and one for the negative electrode. Caution: Wear gloves to avoid direct contact with epoxy glue. Squeeze A and B glues separately onto different regions of the aluminum foil. Use a toothpick to mix the A and B glues. For best results, apply the mixture of the AB glues to seal the electrodes 1–2 min following mixing. 1. The positive electrode is composed of platinum foil on top of eight microscope slides ( Figure 1A –D ). Figure 1. Preparation of platinum electrodes for electroporation with a horizontal configuration. (A) The arrangement of the base six slides. Dark gray slides represent the second layer. The numbers in the circles correspond to the slide numbers mentioned in the text. (B) The platinum (Pt) foil is aligned to one side of the seventh slide, leaving an overhanging square. (C) The wire is soldered to the edge of the overhanging platinum square. (D) The last slide is glued to the base. (E, F) Arrangement for making the negative electrode (modified from [21]). a. Combine six slides (first to sixth) using epoxy glue into three layers to form the base slides ( Figure 1A ). The orientation of the two slides in the second layer is different from that of all the others. b. Cut a 15 × 15 mm square piece of platinum foil with an overhanging 5 × 5 mm square for wire connection. Use epoxy glue to attach the platinum piece to the middle part of the seventh slide, leaving the overhanging square outside the slide for soldering to the electric wire ( Figure 1B ). Critical: The platinum foil is easily cut by scissors. Before cutting, use a marker pen to draw the square with an overhang to make the electrode. The size of the platinum piece is determined by (cannot be less than) the size of the retinal explants and the diameter of the negative electrode. A larger platinum square conducts electroporation more easily, but a greater volume of DNA solution is required for transfection. Each transfection requires at least 380 μL of DNA solution (0.2 μg/μL) for this size of electrodes (final 1 × 1 cm square). A lower DNA solution concentration (e.g., 0.1 μg/μL) may lead to reduced transfection efficiency, whereas a higher concentration (e.g., 0.3 μg/μL) does not significantly improve efficiency. We recommend 380–400 μL of DNA solution (concentration: 0.2–0.3 μg/μL) for this size of electrodes. Increasing the incubation time with the DNA plasmid-containing solution can significantly improve transfection efficiency (see step D1 ). Critical: The size of the overhanging square (5 × 5 mm) should be at least three times larger than the thickness of the slide, so that the electric wire can be embedded in the space between the first and the third layers of slides ( Figure 1C ). Critical: The conductivity of the electrode will decrease if epoxy glue stains the main platinum square. Use 75% ethanol (or other organic solvents, e.g., ether or acetone) to clean the platinum piece after gluing. c. Expose the red-colored electric wire by removing its surrounding insulating sleeve. Solder the multi-core wire to the overhanging square of the platinum piece on the seventh slide ( Figure 1C ). Attach the seventh slide to the base slides using epoxy glue. Stabilize the wire by gluing it to the first layer of the base slides. Critical: The size of the soldering tin should be smaller than the thickness of the slides; otherwise, the soldering tin will become an obstacle for attaching the eighth slide to the base. Since positive electrode malfunction typically occurs at the connection point of the soldering wires, it is recommended to test the positive electrode conductivity before gluing the eighth slide. d. Glue the eighth slide ( Figure 1D ). To avoid the solution leaking into the space between the first and third layers of slides, fill the seams between all slides with epoxy glue, e.g., the seams at the connection of the sixth to eighth slides and the side-view seams of the first and third layers of slides. e. Use epoxy glue to make a well for containing the DNA solution. Critical: To make a well for containing the DNA solution, first mix equal parts of epoxy glue (Part A and Part B) thoroughly with a toothpick. Next, apply the epoxy around the border of the positive electrode surface to form the walls of the well, leaving the base clean so the DNA solution can contact the platinum. Smooth and shape the walls to be vertical and uniform, filling any gaps to make the well leakproof. Allow the epoxy to cure according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically for 1–2 h for initial setting and 24 h for full strength. After curing, test the well by adding a small volume of water to ensure it holds liquid without leaking before adding the DNA solution. 2. The negative electrode is composed of a platinum foil attached and sealed to one opening of a tube, inside which a black-colored wire is connected to the platinum foil by soldering. The tube can be any object with a thick wall and a flat cross-section, such as a ball-point pen tube, allowing the platinum piece to attach tightly. a. Penetrate the multi-core wire through the hollow tube. b. Cut a round platinum piece with a diameter larger than that (~1 cm) of the tube. c. Solder the wire onto the center of the round platinum piece ( Figure 1E ). d. Use epoxy glue to attach the platinum piece to the tube and ensure the sealing is waterproof ( Figure 1F ). B. Preparation of the electroporation setup (see Figure 2 ) Figure 2. Electroporation setup. (A) Overview of the entire electroporation setup. (B) Connection of the positive (+) and negative (-) electrodes. The horizontal level is measured using a circular bubble level placed on the base of the positive electrode. (C) Positive electrode. (D) Measurement of the horizontal gap between electrodes using the micromanipulator (modified from [21]). 1. Establish the micromanipulator and the magnetic stand on the stainless-steel plate. Hold the negative electrode with the micromanipulator, allowing for three-dimensional fine adjustment. 2. Put the positive electrode in the fixed position on the stainless-steel plate to ensure a constant horizontal level. Critical: The horizontal level of the positive electrode can be adjusted by attaching molding clay to the corners at the bottom of the slide base. Use the circular bubble level to measure the horizontal level. 3. Attach the electric wires to a connector with a BNC cable according to their respective colors. Connect the banana plugs at one end of the BNC cable to the electroporator ( Figure 2A , B ). 4. Before conducting electroporation, lower the negative electrode to touch the positive electrode and write down the z-position on the micromanipulator as the original point. Lift the negative electrode from its original position to the level used for the distance between the positive and negative electrodes during electroporation, e.g., 4 mm ( Figure 2C , D ). Critical: When measuring the original point, it is essential to lower the negative electrode to gently touch the positive electrode; otherwise, the negative electrode may be slightly pushed up, making the original point inaccurate. Critical: All equipment for electroporation must be sterilized with tissue paper containing 75% ethanol. C. Preparation of retinal explant culture 1. Use a No. 11 scalpel blade and a clean No. 1 filter paper as the cutting board. Cut a nitrocellulose filter paper into six pie-shaped pieces and then trim them into six pentagons. The pointed end of each pentagon can serve as an orientation marker for the retinal explants. For subsequent patch-clamp experiments, cut a 1 × 1 mm square hole in the center of each pentagon-shaped filter paper to allow light transmission for visualizing the patch pipette and target neurons. Sterilize the filter papers (dark side facing up) under UV light for 30 min before use. Critical: Store the filter papers in a dust-free environment. Wear dry gloves when handling nitrocellulose filter papers, as sweat or moisture can interfere with retinal attachment. 2. Anesthetize rat or mouse pups (P0–P2) on ice (typically 3–4 min for rat pups and 2–3 min for mouse pups). Decapitate the pups on a towel using a razor blade. Cut the eyelids with a No. 10 scalpel blade and enucleate the eyes using fine dissecting scissors. Critical: All tools for surgery and culture must be sterilized using an autoclave, 75% ethanol, or UV. 3. Under a dissection microscope, place an eyeball on clean No. 1 filter paper and make a single cut between the iris and the retina using a No. 11 scalpel blade ( Figure 3A ). Transfer the eyeball to a 10-cm Petri dish containing retinal dissection buffer. Use Vannas scissors to cut around the iris ( Figure 3B ). With two No. 5 forceps, gently unfold the eyecup to expose the retina without severing the optic nerve ( Figure 3C ). Using No. 5 forceps and a paintbrush, carefully detach the blood vessels connected to the lens. Then, using two No. 5 forceps, grasp and stretch the optic nerve and blood vessels covering the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer to isolate the retina ( Figure 3C , D ). Cut each retina into halves or thirds. 4. Use a paintbrush and fine-tipped glass droppers to flip the retinal pieces ( Figure 3E ) so that the RGC layer faces the microscope slide ( Figure 3F ). 5. Lift the microscope slide with the retinal pieces from the buffer. Using forceps, attach the nitrocellulose filter papers onto the slide over the retinal pieces ( Figure 3G ). Add a few drops of retinal dissection buffer to rinse the filter paper ( Figure 3H ). Gently wick away the residual buffer with Kimwipes and remove the filter from the slide ( Figure 3I ). Figure 3.

Grasp and stretch the optic nerve and blood vessels covering the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer to isolate the retina. (E) The curvature bends the RGC layer inward; flip the retinal piece. (F) The RGC layer faces the microscope slide. (G) Attach the nitrocellulose filter paper onto the slide over the retinal piece. (H) Add a few drops of retinal dissection buffer to rinse the filter paper. (I) Overview of a whole-mount retinal piece after gently wicking away the residual buffer and removing the filter from the slide. Critical: Ensure the dark side of the filter paper faces the microscope slide. This orientation positions the RGC layer upward against the dark background of the filter paper. Submerge each filter paper with its attached retina in a well containing 0.5 mL of SFCM-A with forskolin, and keep the retinal explant cultures in a CO 2 incubator. See troubleshooting: Discard any filter paper that becomes wet before attachment, as retinal pieces easily detach from pre-wetted filter paper during culture. D. Electroporation of retinal explants 1. In a sterile culture hood, take the retinal explants out of the medium (SFCM-A with forskolin). Gently blot excess medium with sterile tissue paper. Incubate retinal explants in the DNA-containing solution for at least 10 min in the culture hood. Critical: Freshly prepare sufficient DNA-containing solution for all explants. Incubate all explants together in a 3.5-cm dish containing this solution for at least 10 min. A longer incubation time (e.g., 30 min) yields better transfection efficiency. Critical: The conductivity (σ) of this solution is calculated by summing the contributions of all ions—multiplying each ion’s molar concentration by its limiting molar conductivity—and converting to S/m, yielding approximately 1.75 S/m at 25 °C for this DNA-containing solution. Reducing the fraction of retina dissection buffer, which has a conductivity of 1.93 S/m, will lower the overall conductivity and reduce transfection efficiency. 2. Set up the electroporation apparatus as shown in Figure 2 , ensuring a 4-mm gap between the negative and positive electrodes to maintain a constant electric field. 3. Using forceps, gently lift the filter paper with the retinal explant (the RGC layer facing up) and place it flat inside the well on top of the positive electrode ( Figure 4A ). The retinal explant should sit entirely within the well. 4. Add 400 μL of DNA-containing solution to cover the retinal explant and fill the well ( Figure 4B ). Critical: The DNA-containing solution must connect both electrodes. To achieve this, lower the negative electrode into the well, then raise it back to the 4-mm position. This forms a continuous column of solution between the electrodes. 5. Confirm that the retinal explant is placed between the negative and positive electrodes, fully surrounded by the DNA solution ( Figure 4C ). 6. Set the BTX ECM830 electroporator parameters as follows: Mode: LV (low voltage) Voltage: 30 V Pulse length: 50 ms Number of pulses: 2 Pulse interval: 1 s 7. Press Start to perform electroporation. Critical: Record the actual voltage applied after electroporation. The delivered voltage may differ slightly from the set value (e.g., a 30 V setting may produce an actual pulse of 27 V). For instance, 30 V across a 4-mm gap yields an electric field of 7.5 V/mm, whereas 27 V produces 6.75 V/mm. We recommend maintaining the field strength (E) below 7.5 V/mm (optimal range: 6.5–6.75 V/mm). Critical: When the field strength (E) is 7.5 V/mm and the conductivity (σ) of the DNA solution is 1. 75 S/m at 25 °C : Current density: J = σ, E = 1.75 S/m × 7,500 V/m = 13,125 A/m 2 . Current through the electrodes (~1 × 1 cm square; area = 1.0 × 10 -4 m 2 ): I = J, A = 13,125 × 1.0 × 10 -4 = 1.3125 A. For 400 μL of solution connecting the electrodes (V = 400 μL = 4.0 × 10 -7 m 3 ): Instantaneous power dissipated in the 400 μL solution: P = p⋅V, where p = σ·E 2 is the volumetric power density. p = 1.75 × (7,500) 2 = 98,437,500 W/m 3 , so P = 98,437,500 W/m 3 × 4.0 × 10 -7 m 3 = 39.375 W ≈ 39.4 W. Energy per 50-ms pulse: U = P·t = 39.375 W × 0.05 s = 1.96875 J ≈ 1.97 J per pulse. Instantaneous temperature rise (assuming no heat loss during the pulse): ΔT = (p·t)/(ρ·c p ), where ρ = 1,000 kg/m 3 and c p = 4184 J/(kg·K). ΔT = (98,437,500 W/m 3 × 0.05 s)/(1,000 kg/m × 4184 J/(kg·K)) ≈ 1.1766 K ≈ 1.18 °C per pulse. Dielectric permittivity (ε) of the solution characterizes its ability to store charge in an electric field: ε = εr⋅ε0 = 78.5 × 8.854 × 10 −12 = 6.95 × 10 -10 F/m, where εr is the relative permittivity of the medium (~78.5 for water at 25 °C) and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (~8.854 × 10 -12 F/m). Charge-relaxation time: τ = ε/σ = 6.95 × 10 -10 /1.75 = 3.97 × 10 -10 s ≈ 0.40 ns. Because the pulse length (50 ms) is many orders of magnitude longer than τ (~0.40 ns), conduction current dominates and capacitive effects are negligible for this pulse width (i.e., charges relax very fast). Therefore, dielectric (capacitive) effects are negligible for 50-ms pulses in this setup. 8. Immediately after electroporation, transfer the explant back into SFCM-A with forskolin in the culture hood and return it to the CO 2 incubator. 9. Verify the presence of bubbles on the platinum electrode surface as an indication of successful electroporation ( Figure 4D ). Critical: For consecutive electroporations, reset the parameters each time. Clean the well and electrodes with 75% ethanol between samples. Avoid reusing the DNA-containing solution, as this significantly reduces cell viability. Figure 4. Procedure for electroporation. (A) A filter paper with the retinal explant attached is placed in the well on top of the positive electrode. (B) The DNA-containing solution is added to the well. (C) The retinal explant is covered by the DNA-containing solution and then subjected to electric pulses. (D) Bubbles form on the surface of both electrodes after electroporation. E. Culture for gene expression 1. Transfer each electroporated retinal explant into a fresh well containing 0.5 mL of new SFCM-A with forskolin daily. 2. Before performing patch-clamp or live imaging experiments, incubate the explant in fresh SFCM-A without forskolin for 1–2 h. Successful expression is verified by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 5 ). See troubleshooting: Although forskolin supports neuronal survival, axon outgrowth [28], and sodium current maintenance, it also increases the frequency and amplitude of retinal waves [29]. To preserve experimental flexibility in manipulating retinal waves, remove forskolin prior to functional studies.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol (or parts of it) has been used and validated in the following research articles: Chiang et al.

    "title": "A Step-By-Step Protocol for Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy Imaging of Proteinaceous Deposits in Cultured Cells and Human Brain Tissues.",
    "abstract": "An improved correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) method has recently been introduced and successfully employed to identify and analyze protein inclusions in cultured cells as well as pathological proteinaceous deposits in postmortem human brain tissues from individuals with diverse neurodegenerative diseases. This method significantly enhances antigen preservation and target registration by replacing conventional dehydration and embedding reagents. It achieves an optimal balance of sensitivity, accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness compared to other current CLEM approaches. However, due to space constraints, only a brief overview of this method was provided in the initial publication. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate widespread adoption, the author now presents a detailed, step-by-step protocol of this optimized CLEM technique. By enhancing usability and accessibility, this protocol aims to promote broader application of CLEM in neurodegenerative disease research. Key features • This protocol incorporates optimized sample processing and innovative fiducial marking techniques that enhance antigen preservation and improve target registration, respectively. • By utilizing serial ultrathin sections for CLEM, this protocol significantly increases correlation accuracy. • A novel \"sandwich method\" is introduced, which enables simultaneous detection of multiple proteinopathies through immunofluorescence staining or precise localization of pathological targets using immunogold labeling. • Overall, this protocol offers an effective balance of sensitivity, accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness compared to existing CLEM methodologies.",

Sample process: fixation, dehydration, infiltration, embedding 1. Soak cell pellets (that were obtained in a standard 1.5 mL reaction tube by centrifugation) in fixation solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C for fixation. Tissues from formalin-fixed postmortem human brain do not require additional fixation but should be cut with a blade into small pieces no larger than approximately 1 mm 3 , estimated visually. 2. Wash samples three times with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Post-fix in 1% osmium tetroxide for 60–90 min. During solution replacement, old solutions should be aspirated slowly and carefully, and new solutions should be added gently to prevent accidental suction or displacement of the sample from the tube. A minimum volume of 1 mL should be used for all steps carried out in 1.5 mL tubes. 3. Wash samples three times with distilled water to completely remove excess OsO 4 . Stain with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 min. 4. Dehydrate samples sequentially with 30%, 50%, and 75% DMSO (diluted from anhydrous DMSO with ultrapure water) for 10–15 min each. Follow with two incubations in 90% DMSO, each for 10–15 min. 5. Infiltrate the samples with LR white resin for 1 h, repeating the process three times. To enhance infiltration efficiency, place the tubes containing the samples on a rotator to ensure continuous interaction between the samples and the resin. 6. Embed the samples in fresh LR white resin using embedding tubes and polymerize the resin in a vacuum oven at 50 °C. Polymerization should proceed for 24–48 h. B. Section process: trimming, sectioning, and loading 1. For brain tissue, screening of blocks is necessary, as not all contain pathological features. Cut 500–1,000 nm semi-thin sections with the Leica UC7 ultramicrotome and stain with 1% toluidine blue in 1% borate. Identify blocks with structures of interest under a light microscope. For example, Lewy bodies in this protocol appear as large, spherical inclusions occupying substantial cytoplasmic space by displacing neuromelanin, as shown in Figure 1A . This step is not required for cell culture samples. Figure 1. Trimming the cutting surface of the sample block from human brain tissue. (A) Identify the region of interest (ROI) on the toluidine blue–stained semi-thin section. In this protocol, the ROI contains Lewy bodies, highlighted by a red frame in the left image and enlarged in the right image. Two Lewy bodies are indicated by red arrowheads. Scale bars are included in both images. (B) Using the toluidine blue–stained section as a reference, mark a trapezoid around the ROI with a needle or sharp-tipped tweezers. Then, trim the block’s cutting surface with a blade to remove excess tissue. (C) Ensure that the section cut from the trimmed block is smaller than the filmed single hole of the EM grid. 2. For brain tissues, mark a trapezoid around the target area (e.g., Lewy body pathology shown in Figure 1A ) using a needle or sharp-point tweezers and trim the cutting surface with a blade accordingly ( Figure 1B ). For cell culture blocks, trim directly into a trapezoid. Note: Ensure that the entire section is smaller than the filmed single hole (1.5 mm in diameter) of the grid ( Figure 1C ). While a trapezoidal shape is recommended, other shapes may also be used as long as the section edges differ sufficiently in length and angles to remain distinguishable. 3. Using a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome, cut two or three continuous sections of varying thickness: a. For a simple CLEM method of LM/EM: 120 nm/70 nm as shown in Figure 2A . b. For the sandwich method of LM/EM/LM: 120 nm/70 nm/120 nm as shown in Figure 2B . c. For the sandwich method of LM/EM/IEM: 120 nm/70 nm/90 nm as shown in Figure 2C . Figure 2. Demonstration of two or three consecutive sections of varying thickness for different correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) modes. (A) Simple CLEM mode (LM/EM): two consecutive sections are collected at 120 and 70 nm thickness. (B) Sandwich CLEM mode (LM/EM/LM): three consecutive sections are collected at 120, 70, and 120 nm. (C) Sandwich CLEM mode (LM/EM/IEM): three consecutive sections are collected at 120, 70, and 90 nm. Note that the color of the section on the water surface reflects its thickness. Sections with thicknesses of 70, 90, and 120 nm typically appear silver, light brown, and deep brown, respectively. 4. For 120 nm sections, place a drop of gelatin solution onto a slide, then transfer the section onto the gelatin solution drop using a perfect loop. Incubate the slide at 70 °C to fully flatten the section to minimize the formation of folds. Once dry, circle the section on the reverse side with a diamond scriber to aid localization during immunostaining. 5. For 70 and 90 nm sections, use coverslip forceps to grip the grid without damaging the film. Use a formvar-coated copper grid for 70 nm and a nickel grid for 90 nm sections. Note: The coverslip forceps securely hold the grid while allowing flexible adjustment of the film surface angle relative to the water surface in the boat, making it easier to position the film for section pickup compared to other types of forceps (see Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Loading an ultrathin section onto a filmed single-hole grid using coverslip forceps. (A) The coverslip forceps grip the grid securely at the top and bottom, while allowing flexible adjustment of the grid’s film angle relative to the water surface. (B) This adjustable angle facilitates parallel alignment between the film and the floating ultrathin section, improving the likelihood of successful transfer to the grid. (C) Grid with successful loading of an ultrathin section in the filmed center hole. C. Staining process: immunofluorescence staining, immunolabeling, and UA/lead staining C1. Immunofluorescence staining 1. Outline the section using a hydrophobic pen (guided by the scriber mark). Add 150–200 μL of 10% sodium meta-periodate to remove OsO 4 from 120 nm sections and incubate in a dark chamber for 1 h at room temperature. Wash three times each with water and then 1× TBST. 2. Block with 100–200 μL of 100% goat serum for 30 min. Remove blocking serum, then incubate the whole section with primary antibody (NACP98, 1:300 diluted in 50% goat serum) overnight at 4 °C. Wash with 1× TBST three times (5 min each), then briefly rinse in water to remove detergent-derived bubbles. 3. Incubate with secondary antibodies (1:500 diluted in 50% goat serum) for 1 h. Wash as above. 4. Add 200 μL of Sudan Black B to cover the entire section. Incubate for 15 min to quench autofluorescence, then rinse briefly with water to remove unstained dye. 5. Mount with VECTASHIELD ® antifade mounting medium with DAPI. 6. Use DAPI-stained nuclei for focal adjustment. Capture whole-section images using the tile scan mode on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with a 40× lens. Optimize laser intensity/exposure to minimize photobleaching while maintaining sufficient resolution for subsequent EM correlation. A speed of 5 or 6 is recommended. Export as TIFF, including all channels and the merged image. Note: A single tile scan focused on the central area typically provides sufficient fluorescence signals across the entire section. Multi-focus or Z-stacking is generally unnecessary for 120 nm-thick sections due to their limited depth. C2. Immunogold labeling 1. Prepare a 100-mm Petri dish and coat the inside bottom with parafilm. 2. Add a drop (50–100 μL) of 5% sodium meta-periodate onto the parafilm. Place the nickel grid on top of the drop with the section side facing the solution. Incubate for 30–60 min in a dark chamber for epitope retrieval. 3. Transfer the grid to a drop of ultrapure water for 5 min. Repeat this wash step three times to completely remove residual sodium meta-periodate. Then, place the grid onto a drop of 1× TBS to equilibrate the pH. 4. Add a drop of 100% goat serum onto the parafilm and place the grid on top of the serum for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. 5. Dilute the primary antibody in 50% goat serum (NACP98, 1:20 dilution). Place the grid on top of the antibody drop (25–30 μL per drop). Add a piece of fully moistened paper towel into the Petri dish to maintain humidity, cover with the lid, and incubate overnight at 4 °C. 6. The next day, prepare a clean 24-well cell culture plate with three wells filled with TBST and two wells with ultrapure water. Add a drop of secondary antibody conjugated with gold particles, diluted in 50% goat serum (1:25 dilution), onto a fresh area of parafilm in the Petri dish. 7. Using a pair of forceps, firmly grip the metal edge of the grid and sequentially wash it by dipping it 10 times in each of the TBST wells, followed by the water wells. 8. Blot excess water from the grid with filter paper (Whatman, 1002-090) and place it on top of the secondary antibody solution. Incubate for 1 h. 9. Prepare a clean 24-well cell culture plate with three wells filled with TBST and two wells with ultrapure water. Repeat the washing procedure described in step C2.7. The grid is now ready for uranyl acetate (UA) and lead citrate staining (see section C3). C3. UA/lead staining (for both copper and nickel grids) 1. Prepare a 100-mm Petri dish and coat the inside bottom with parafilm. 2. Fill six wells of a clean 24-well cell culture plate with pre-boiled and then cooled ultrapure Milli-Q water. 3. On the parafilm, add a 20 μL drop of 2% UA prepared in ultrapure Milli-Q water. 4. Carefully transfer the copper or nickel grid (with a 70-nm or 90-nm ultrathin section) onto the UA drop, with the section side facing the solution. Stain for 5–10 min. Simultaneously, place a drop of ultrapure water next to the UA drop to prepare for immediate washing. 5. After UA staining, firmly grip the metal edge of the grid with forceps and wash it by sequentially dipping it 10 times in each of the first three wells of ultrapure water. Then, rest the grid briefly on a drop of preloaded ultrapure water on the parafilm. 6. Add a 10 μL drop of lead citrate staining solution onto the parafilm. 7. Blot excess water from the grid with filter paper (Whatman, 1002-090), then transfer the grid onto the lead citrate drop and stain for 5–10 min. 8. After staining, blot off the excess lead solution with filter paper (Whatman, 1002-090). Then, wash the grid by sequentially dipping it 10 times in each of the remaining three wells of ultrapure water. 9. Blot off excess water with filter paper (Whatman, 1002-090). Store the grid in a pre-labeled grid box. Once air-dried (normally needs 20–30 min), the grid is ready for electron microscopy (EM) examination. D. Image processing D1. Navigation of EM section using the whole-section image of fluorescent LM 1. Load the stained 70-nm or 90-nm ultrathin section into the electron microscope (EM). 2. Capture an overview image of the entire section at low magnification (10× to 1,000×) by switching the MAG function to LOW MAG on the control panel. If the section is too large to be covered in a single image, multiple shots may be needed. This whole-section image is crucial for accurately aligning the fluorescent LM image with the EM section. 3. Open the fluorescent LM image of the whole section on a laptop using Photoshop. Use the Free Transform tool to rotate the image so that the orientations of the two trapezoids (EM and fluorescent LM) align correctly. 4. Choose a corner or edge of the EM section and use fluorescence-positive targets and nuclei (serving as fiducial markers) from the fluorescent LM image to navigate. This approach enables accurate registration of targets between the EM section and the fluorescent LM image by identifying the nucleus of target-containing cells or, if extracellular, the nucleus in proximate cells. Each nucleus has a unique shape and size, making it easy to distinguish individual cells at the same location. Examine the ultrastructure of each target and select those of potential interest. Capture overview images of those targets, referred to as primary EM images, and label the corresponding regions in the fluorescent LM image. 5. Continue examining the entire section until primary images for all targets with potential interest are acquired under the EM and the corresponding labels are applied to the fluorescent LM image. Note: See detailed demonstration in Figures 4 and 5 . It is worth noting that the navigation for the EM section is much easier in a cell sample than a human brain sample. This is because there is a sufficient number of DAPI-stained nuclei in the fluorescent LM image from cell samples to be used as the fiducial marker ( Figure 4 ) in comparison to the fluorescent LM image from human brain tissue, in which not every section contains sufficient nuclei for reference ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, additional time and care may be needed for samples from human brain tissue. Moreover, it may be necessary to perform a second EM imaging session at a higher magnification to capture finer ultrastructural details for the identified targets of interest revealed by the CLEM analysis ( Figures 6 and 7 ). Therefore, it is advisable to keep the grid in the sample holder until the second EM imaging session is complete. This will avoid realignment of the sections due to a change in orientation after unloading the sample. Figure 4. EM section navigation using whole-section fluorescent LM images for cultured cell samples. Rotate the whole-section fluorescent LM image (A) to align with the section under EM (B). Select a reference point, such as a corner or edge (e.g., red frame), and use fluorescence-positive targets and nuclei as fiducial markers. (A′) A higher-magnification view shows fluorescently labeled nuclei (blue) and α-synuclein inclusions (green) at the section edge. (B′) Corresponding EM view of the region in (A′). Same-colored arrows indicate the same nucleus across LM and EM images. Same-colored arrowheads indicate the same inclusions. Scale bars are included. Note: Although red asterisks mark the same nucleus, the nucleus in the EM image appears deformed due to section folding, visible as a black line. Avoid such artifacts in CLEM to maintain accuracy. Figure 5. EM section navigation using fluorescent LM images for human brain tissue samples. Rotate the fluorescent LM image (A) to match the orientation of the section under EM (B). Select a reference edge (e.g., red frame) and align based on fluorescence-positive structures and nuclei. (A′) A higher-magnification view shows fluorescently labeled nuclei (blue) and Lewy pathology (green) in a section corner. (B′) Corresponding EM view of the region in (A′). Same-colored arrows and arrowheads denote corresponding nuclei and inclusions in both images. Scale bars are included. Note: Human brain sections often contain fewer nuclei for alignment. Additional time and care may be needed. Figure 6. Step-by-step CLEM application for cultured cell samples. (A) Open both the primary EM image and the high-magnification fluorescent LM image of the target area in PhotoPad Image Editor. (B) Set the opacity of the fluorescent LM image to ~70% to keep the underlying EM structures visible. (C) Rotate and resize the fluorescent LM image so that nuclei and target structures align with those in the EM image. (D) Crop individual targets of interest and export merged images for reference during the second EM imaging session. (E, F) Conduct a second EM imaging session to acquire higher-resolution images of selected targets. Scale bars are included in each panel. Figure 7. Step-by-step CLEM application for human brain samples. (A) Open both the primary EM image and the high-magnification fluorescent LM image of the target area in PhotoPad Image Editor. (B) Set the opacity of the fluorescent LM image to ~70% to keep the underlying EM structures visible. (C) Rotate and resize the fluorescent LM image so that nuclei and target structures align with those in the EM image. (D) Crop individual targets of interest and export merged images for reference during the second EM imaging session. (E, F) Conduct a second EM imaging session to acquire higher-resolution images of selected targets. Scale bars are included in each panel. D2. Second fluorescent LM acquisition to improve image quality 1. Using the labeled fluorescent LM image, locate each individual target by using the DAPI-stained nuclei as fiducial markers under a confocal microscope. 2. Adjust the laser intensity and exposure time to optimize the DAPI signal and the fluorescence signal for each labeled target. Focus on the specific target to achieve a fluorescence LM image with a better quality under the 40× lens. This step maximizes target signal collection and minimizes potential signal loss from tile scans caused by slight focus deviations. 3. Export the fluorescent LM image as a TIFF file. These images are now ready to be overlaid with the corresponding EM image. D3. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) In this protocol, we use a commercial software, PhotoPad Image Editor, to correlate images from EM and LM. The main steps are demonstrated in Figures 6 and 7 . 1. Open the primary EM image of the target with potential interest in PhotoPad Image Editor. 2. Click Image+ to add the corresponding high-magnification fluorescent LM image as a top layer on the EM image ( Figures 6A and 7A ). 3. Adjust the opacity of the fluorescent LM image to approximately 70% or to an optimal level based on contrast and signal strength. This allows both the fluorescent signals and the underlying ultrastructural features in the EM image to remain visible ( Figures 6B and 7B ). 4. Use the mouse to rotate the fluorescent LM image, then adjust its size by dragging its edges until the nucleus and specific target structures are perfectly matched between the two images. Matching the nuclei is usually straightforward, while matching the target of interest may require more attention to detail. For protein deposits, this step is typically easier, as these structures usually present distinctive shapes in the EM image ( Figures 6C and 7C ). 5. Once the images are perfectly overlapped, save the CLEM project. Export the fluorescent LM image in its correlated orientation and the merged EM-LM image. Once the targets of interest are identified, crop each individual target and export the merged image for the subsequent second EM imaging session ( Figures 6D and 7D ). 6. Using the cropped overview image as a reference, conduct a second EM imaging session on the same EM section to acquire higher-resolution images of selected targets ( Figures 6E, 6F , 7E , and 7F). Final resolution should be determined based on whether the ultrastructural detail is adequate for analysis. Note: In the LM/EM/LM sandwich method, the same EM section placed in the center is used to correlate with two flanking fluorescent LM sections. The two correlated datasets can then be merged to produce a final CLEM image, allowing targets of interest from both LM sections to be projected onto the central EM section. In the LM/EM/IEM sandwich method, the central EM section is correlated with one outer fluorescent LM section and one immuno-EM (IEM) section. This approach enables the projection of targets of interest onto the same EM section, visualized both as fluorescence signals and as gold particles. The latter provides precise localization at the ultrastructural level [20].\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article(s): • Jiang et al.

    "title": "Intravitreal NHS-Biotin Injection and Immunohistochemistry to Label and Image Protein Transport in the Mouse Optic Nerve.",
    "abstract": "The process of moving proteins and organelles along the axon is essential for neuronal survival and function, ensuring proper communication between the cell body and distant synapses. The efficient and precise delivery of proteins via axon transport is critical for processes ranging from synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission to neuronal growth and maintenance. However, the identities of all the transported proteins have only recently begun to be investigated. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) provide a unique opportunity for access to central nervous system (CNS) axons as the retina is located outside the brain in the eye, with long axonal projections (~1 cm in mouse) that innervate the brain. We have developed and optimized methods for unbiased in vivo protein labeling in rodent RGC somata with intravitreal N-hydroxysuccinimido (NHS)-biotin and subsequent visualization of transported proteins along the optic nerve using confocal microscopy. Here, we describe these procedures in detail. Key features • Expands on the intravitreal injection method presented in Schiapparelli et al. [1] and extends it to whole mount optic nerve immunolabeling. • Unbiased in vivo labeling of proteins in the mouse central nervous system. • Optimized mouse intravitreal injection procedure using glass needles to reduce injury and costs. • Immunofluorescent imaging of the cleared intact optic nerve to visualize transported labeled proteins.",

Under the dissecting scope, put mineral oil onto a whetstone. b. Using the whetstone and mineral oil, grind down the tip of the reverse-action forceps to make it blunt and safer for the mouse. 2. Score glass capillaries ( Figure 1A , B): a. Using a ruler and tape, create a guide for scoring the glass capillaries. b. Tape down one (or several) glass capillaries against the metric side of the ruler. c. Use a fine-point permanent marker to carefully mark a line every 2 mm. d. Note that 2 mm = 2 μL for the glass specified here (10 cm holds 100 μL). Results will vary if different inner and outer diameter glass capillaries are used. e. The gradations will not be perfectly straight, particularly at the edges, due to the curvature of the glass capillaries ( Figure 1B , C). The level is measured by the meniscus at the center of the gradation, and small variations should only affect the injection volume by 0.1–0.2 μL. Figure 1. Prescoring glass capillaries for needle gradations. A scoring rig using a ruler and tape (A) can be used to mark capillaries every 2 mm along the length (B). Pulled needles will have gradations for measuring dispensed volumes while injecting (C). Note that the gradations closest to the needle tip burn off during the pulling process, but this ensures that the experimenter never dispenses air into the intravitreal space. 3. Pull needles ( Figure 1C ): a. Needles can be pulled to your preferred specifications. b. A long taper works well for strength, penetrability, flow, and minimal injury. c. Using a Sutter P-97 puller, with a 3 mm square box filament (FB330B, ramp 550), we used the following program: Heat 580 Pull 30 Velocity 150 Time 100 d. Note that results will differ based on the filament and ramp value for your machine. Please refer to The Pipette Cookbook, written by Adair Oesterle, for more details: https://www.sutter.com/PDFs/cookbook.pdf . 4. Draw out syringes ( Figure 2A ; [7]): a. Pull out the plunger of a 1 mL syringe to the 0.9 mL mark. b. Using a Bunsen burner, heat the syringe near the 0.2 mL mark, rotating over the flame to evenly melt the plastic. c. When the syringe is melted (or aflame), remove from the flame and allow gravity to pull the tip to the floor. d. Carefully pull the melted tip with gloved hands to elongate the plastic. e. Continue to manually pull as the plastic hardens. f. Syringes can be drawn out straight or curved, depending on your personal preference. Two different examples are shown in Figure 2A . g. Trim the drawn-out tip with a razor blade. h. Label the syringe with the name of the injection compound on tape as shown in Figure 2A and set aside. i. Drawn-out syringes are reusable indefinitely; however, more costly single-use disposable gel-loading tips can also be used to backload needles. Figure 2. Drawn-out syringes for loading needles. Drawn-out syringes (A) work well for back-loading glass needles (B). Both the syringes and the needles can be reused for consistency and as a cost-saving measure. 5. Prepare NHS-biotin ( make fresh daily , cannot be reused on subsequent days): a. Always wear appropriate PPE. b. Weigh out 5 mg of EZ-link NHS-biotin and place in a microfuge tube. c. Add 300 μL of DMSO. d. Mix thoroughly and briefly spin to collect the solution at the bottom of the tube. e. Transfer solution to a 0.22 μm microfuge filter unit. f. Spin for 1 min at 10,000× g to filter the solution. g. Discard the filter and wrap the tube in foil or transfer filtered solution to an amber tube to protect from light. B. Setup for injections ( Figure 3A ) Figure 3. Injection setup and positioning the mouse. (A) Position the nose cone in the top center of the field of view and make sure the needle holder can reach that space and is in focus. (B) Position the mouse so that the nose is snugly in the nose cone, and (C) proptose the eye with a pair of reverse-action forceps so the eye is pointing up and accessible for injection (C). 1. Place the heating pad on the microscope base and turn on the settings so that it is warm to the touch (~37 °C). 2. Cover the heating pad with absorbent paper and tape down the corners. 3. Position the nose cone so that it is in the upper portion of the field of view (so that the eyes will be in the center of the field of view). Tape down in place. 4. Adjust microscope lighting and focus so that the nose cone is visible. 5. Place the micromanipulator with the needle holder close to the microscope (left or right side, depending on your handedness). 6. Adjust the micromanipulator so that the needle holder is at a 45° angle with respect to the worktop. 7. Swing the needle holder into the center of the working area and make sure you can maneuver it and get it in focus close to the nose cone. 8. Attach PicoSpritzer tubing to the needle holder. 9. Turn on air (house or nitrogen tank) and adjust PicoSpritzer pressure to ~40 psi. 10. Set PicoSpritzer timing to 10–20 ms (you will adjust this later) 11. Tap the foot pedal to make sure that you can feel a puff of air coming out of the needle holder opening on your fingertip. 12. Attach the nose cone to the anesthesia tubing and gas scavenger can. 13. Attach the anesthesia box to the tubing and gas scavenger can. 14. Tape the tubing in place near the tubing clamps. 15. Attach tubing to the isoflurane/oxygen precision vaporizer. 16. Lay out your tools: reverse-action forceps, #55 forceps, ophthalmic ointment, antibiotic ointment, and cotton swabs. 17. Create a recovery chamber by placing a paper towel inside a clean (ideally high-walled) mouse cage on top of the second heating pad. 18. Back-load a needle with NHS-biotin reagent ( Figure 2B ): a. Aspirate a small amount of NHS-biotin solution using the prepared syringe with the drawn-out tip ( Figure 2A ). b. Place the tip of the syringe into the glass needle as far in as possible. c. Slowly dispense the liquid by gently pressing the syringe plunger while backing the syringe out of the needle. This will help avoid getting bubbles in the needle. It is extremely important not to introduce bubbles into the glass capillary. Some bubbles can be forced to rise to the top by flicking the middle of the needle, but do so cautiously to avoid breaking it. 19. Load the needle into the needle holder in the micromanipulator. Make sure the glass capillary goes completely through the rubber O-ring in the needle holder before tightening. 20. Rotate the micromanipulator so that the needle is in the microscope field of view and focus on the tip. 21. Gently break the tip of the needle while looking through the microscope: a. Using #55 forceps, carefully touch along the length of the needle to find the area where the tip goes from being almost hairlike to being slightly more rigid. b. Break the tip of the needle at the point just above where the needle begins to flex less by pinching it with the forceps. The goal is to have an opening ~20–30 μm in diameter, as measured using a microforge or microscope. c. Tap the foot pedal and see if any fluid is ejected. The goal is to dispense small droplets (~4–6× the diameter of the tip) of liquid from the needle. d. If a small droplet is ejected, then the needle is open and ready for injections. e. If nothing comes out, first check the pressure and time of the PicoSpritzer. Pressure can be increased to 40 psi, and time can be increased up to 30 ms. If nothing dispenses, the tip is likely still sealed closed, so move the forceps a little higher up the needle tip and break again. f. If fluid squirts straight out of the needle onto the absorbent paper, then the needle opening is likely too big. You can try to decrease the time (~10 ms) and the pressure (~20 psi) and test the flow again, but it is likely that you will have to try again with a new needle. g. Once you have a needle that flows well, hold a Kimwipe close to the needle tip and tap the foot pedal to dispense the reagent until the meniscus is visible and lines up with one of the prescored gradations. h. Without moving the base, rotate the micromanipulator out of the way to avoid breaking the needle while you prepare the mouse for injection. i. Note that some protocols recommend using a Hamilton Intraocular Injector syringe with a removable 34-gauge small hub metal needle; however, in our experience, these needles leave a large wound in the mouse eye, and they dull quickly, requiring frequent (and costly) replacement. Pulled glass needles reduce the risk of injury to the animal and are both inexpensive and easily replaceable. C. Intravitreal injection procedure 1. Anesthetize a mouse with 4% isoflurane in 1.5 L/min oxygen in the induction chamber (1–2 min). 2. Redirect anesthesia to the nose cone with tubing clamps (close the clamp going to the induction chamber and open the clamp going to the nose cone tubing) and reduce isoflurane to 1.5%. 3. Rotate the nose cone ~45–90° from vertical to allow access to one eye. 4. Place the mouse on the heating pad and position it so that the nose cone covers the nose and mouth ( Figure 3B ). Note that the animal shown in Figure 4A does not have a snugly fitting nose cone and should be readjusted to ensure proper administration of isoflurane anesthesia without leakage into the room. Figure 4. Positioning the needle for intravitreal injection. (A) Position the micromanipulator so that the needle approaches the eye at a 45° angle. (B, C) The injection site is in the cloudy-colored sclera, just below/behind the heavily vascularized limbus. (D) Inject the first eye and then (E) reposition the mouse and nose cone to inject the second eye. 5. Check that the mouse is in a surgical plane of anesthesia. 6. Adjust the nose cone rotation as necessary so that the right eye is facing upward and can be seen in the center of the microscope field of view. 7. Using the reverse-action forceps, gently pull back the eyelid on both sides of the eye and close the forceps to proptose the eyeball. Gently lay the forceps to the side to keep the eyeball accessible ( Figure 4D ). 8. Rotate the micromanipulator so that the needle is positioned above the eye and lower the needle into the field of view ( Figure 4A ). 9. The target of injection should be in the sclera (cloudy white part on the back half of the eyeball), just posterior to the limbus ( Figure 4B ). Line up the needle so that the tip is pointing at the target area ( Figure 4B , C). Be careful to avoid the ring of blood vessels that circles the equator of the eye; the injection site is posterior to these vessels ( Figure 4C ). 10. Carefully advance the needle using the micromanipulator to insert the needle tip into the eye. There will be some resistance (this eye tissue rigidity increases with mouse age). 11. Once the needle has punctured the eye, back it out slightly and begin injecting by making rapid pulses with the foot pedal. 12. Watch the solution level in the needle and only inject 2 μL (one full gradation mark). 13. Once 2 μL has been dispensed, back the needle out of the eye and swing the micromanipulator out of the way. 14. Remove the reverse-action forceps and use the side of them to gently stroke the eyelids toward the eye to ease the eye back into place. 15. Rotate the nose cone and mouse 180° to repeat the procedure with the other eye ( Figure 4D , E). 16. Record animal number, injection start and stop time, needle number, and any additional notes for future reference (download table). 17. Injections in both eyes should take 3–4 min (total per animal). If the injections take longer than 5 min, the eye may start to dry out as evidenced by a loss of glossy appearance on the surface of the eyeball. Dry eyes should be treated with a small amount of ophthalmic ointment applied directly to the eyeball before returning the animal to the recovery chamber. 18. If there is any bleeding or damage to the eye, treat with a small amount of antibiotic ointment. 19. Place the animal into the recovery chamber. The animal will awaken within 1–2 min and can then be returned to the home cage. Note that this level of isoflurane anesthesia (< 10 min total) is well under the lethal dose of up to several days; animals have no issues in quickly resuming normal activity after this procedure. 20. Repeat with additional mice ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5. Creation of parafilm mounting rigs. (A) Fixed optic nerves have an inherent curvature, as shown after being mounted under four spacing rings. (B, C) Various mounting rigs are carved out of parafilm to assist in positioning the optic nerves linearly for confocal imaging. Note that the top-right corner of the mounting rig has been cut for orientation purposes. 21. Needles can be reused between animals depending on the experimental paradigm and local IACUC regulations. On average, a glass needle can stay sharp for 6–10 animals (12–20 eyes). 22. Repeat injections daily with fresh NHS-biotin for up to 3 days for increased labeling. D. Optic nerve dissection procedure 1. Just prior to dissections, prepare 4% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA) in PBS from a newly opened ampule of PFA. 2. 1–5 days after injections, euthanize the mouse and dissect optic nerves (connected at the chiasm) as described [6]. 3. Immediately place optic nerves in freshly made 4% PFA in a labeled 48-well plate or microfuge tubes and store at 4 °C. 4. Samples can be stored in fixative at 4 °C indefinitely. Be sure to seal the plate with parafilm or place optic nerves in closed microfuge tubes for long-term storage. E. Optic nerve whole-mount immunolabeling In the original manuscript [2], we embedded the optic nerves and sectioned them at 20 μM using a cryostat before immunolabeling. We have since developed a whole-mount labeling protocol that gives better 3D resolution in the intact tissue and facilitates comparison and quantitative analysis of labeling. We have optimized this protocol for anti-biotin immunolabeling while maintaining genetically expressed GFP fluorescence. We present the whole-mount immunostaining protocol here. E1. Preparation for immunolabeling 1. Make mounting rigs for imaging ( Figure 5B , C): a. Layer three sheets of Parafilm M together on top of a slide or other stiff substrate. b. Using a microscalpel, carve out the shape of an elongated Y or funnel. c. The specifications for the carved rig are approximately 0.8–1 cm long, 1 mm wide along the length (to accommodate both optic nerves), and 2 mm wide at the top of the Y (to accommodate the optic chiasm tissue). d. Repeat for multiple optic nerves arrayed on the same slide. e. Make mounting rigs of various sizes to accommodate differences among samples. 2. Prepare immunolabeling solutions as shown below. These can be prepared as needed at the time of the labeling. Blocking solutions with serum need to be stored at 4 °C and used within 1–2 weeks. (Volumes listed are for 10 samples. Adjust as needed.) a. PTx wash buffer (1 L) 1× PBS pH 7.4 0.1% Triton X-100 b. Permeabilization buffer (50 mL) 1× PBS pH 7.4 0.5% Triton X-100 c. Block-Perm buffer (20 mL) Permeabilization buffer 4% bovine serum albumin 1% donkey serum d. Block-antibody buffer (20 mL) PTx Wash buffer 4% bovine serum albumin 1% donkey serum E2. Whole-mount immunolabeling procedure 1. Adjust the spacing screw on the embryo forceps so that the rings do not touch and have a ~2–3 mm gap. This allows for the tissue sample to be collected via surface tension in a droplet of buffer and not touched or damaged by the forceps. Alternatively, regular forceps can be used to transfer tissues by the optic chiasm (assuming the experiments do not require the chiasm to remain intact), but use caution to not grab the sample by the optic nerve itself, which would damage the tissue sample. 2. Using embryo forceps, transfer optic nerve samples from fixative into individually labeled 1.5 mL microfuge tubes with > 1 mL PTx wash buffer. Wash for 5–10 min while rotating at room temperature. 3. Permeabilize: a. Remove PTx with a fine-tipped transfer pipette. b. Add > 1 mL of permeabilization buffer. c. Rotate for ≥ 48 h at room temperature. 4. Block: a. Remove perm buffer with a fine-tipped transfer pipette. b. Add > 1 mL of block-perm buffer. c. Rotate for ≥ 48 h at 4 °C. 5. Primary antibody: a. Dilute goat anti-biotin antibody 1:500 in blocking solution. b. Use Pelco BioWave to help drive Ab into tissue as follows: i. Put 1 mL of Block+Ab solution per well in a 48-well plate. ii. Add one optic nerve per well, taking care to note the location of each sample, or label the plate as needed. iii. Include one extra well of block solution anywhere on the plate for the temperature probe. iv. Using a Pelco BioWave with a water-cooled baseplate, we use the following program for primary antibody penetration: 2 min ON (200 W) 2 min OFF (200 W) 2 min ON (200 W) END v. Take note of the max temp reached once the program is complete. Ideally, the temperature in the samples will stay at or below 40 °C. c. Transfer the samples back to tubes containing fresh block+primary antibody solution. d. Rotate at 4 °C for 2–4 days. Note: We have found that the optic nerve is a difficult tissue for antibodies to penetrate. Increasing the detergent concentration, increasing the time, and using the BioWave are the best methods we have found for antibody penetration throughout the entire depth of the optic nerve (~200–300 μm). 6. Secondary antibody: a. Remove primary antibody solution with a fine-tipped transfer pipette and add > 1 mL of PTx wash buffer to each sample. b. Wash samples five times in PTx for 20–25 min each, rotating at room temperature. c. Dilute secondary antibody, Alexa-568 donkey anti-goat (or the fluorophore and species of your choice) 1:500 in blocking solution. d. Use Pelco BioWave to help drive Ab into tissue as described in step E2.5b. e. Transfer the samples back to tubes with fresh block+secondary antibody solution. f. Rotate at 4 °C for 2–4 days. 7. Nuclear labeling (optional): A. Remove secondary antibody solution with a fine-tipped transfer pipette and add > 1 mL of PTx wash buffer to each sample. b. Wash samples two times in PTx for 20 min each, rotating at room temperature. c. Add Hoechst 33342 to PTx wash buffer at 1:1,000 and rotate for 1 h at room temperature. d. Wash samples two times in PTx for 20 min each, rotating at room temperature. 8. Final washes (if not using nuclear label): a. Remove secondary antibody solution with a fine-tipped transfer pipette and add > 1 mL of PTx wash buffer to each sample. b. Wash samples five times in PTx for 20–25 min each, rotating at room temperature. 9. Tissue clearing: a. Using a fine-tipped transfer pipette, remove as much liquid from the samples as possible. b. Add 100 μL of Focus Clear. c. Let tissues clear in closed tubes at room temperature for 2 days. d. Transfer samples to 4 °C (keep in Focus Clear) until ready to mount. e. Samples can be stored in Focus Clear in closed/sealed tubes at 4 °C indefinitely. If using a 48-well plate, be sure to seal with parafilm. 10. Mounting: Note: Samples have inherent curl ( Figure 5A ) and are best mounted in custom carved rigs described above in step E1 and shown in Figure 5B , C). Alternatively, you can image them in their curved form using spacers ( Figure 5A ) or cut them at the chiasm and image the nerves individually (however, the latter will result in the loss of proximal/distal information provided by the chiasm). a. Prewarm Mount Clear solution at 50 °C to solubilize. b. Place Parafilm rig onto a coverslip. c. Mount optic nerves directly onto the coverslip using forceps to arrange the tissue inside the opening of the rig. d. Wick away excess Focus Clear with a Kimwipe or small piece of Whatman filter paper. e. Using a cut pipette tip, add 20–50 μL of prewarmed Mount Clear onto each sample in the mounting rig. f. Mount slide on top of coverslip (this ensures that when you flip the slide over, the sample is flat against the coverslip and closest to the objective). Note that coverslips are not sealed; the Mount Clear is sticky enough to keep the coverslip in place, and then the coverslip can be removed easily for sample storage (see steps E2.10h–i below). g. Image optic nerves on a confocal microscope or a plate/slide scanner. A standard confocal, like a Nikon C2, with large image stitching and multi-point imaging, works well for multiple optic nerves; it can run overnight, and imaging takes ~3 h per sample since the optic nerves are each ~0.5–1 cm long ( Figure 6 ). Higher magnification and high-resolution confocal imaging can reveal detailed subcellular localization of the NHS-biotin-labeled proteins in the optic nerve ( Figure 7 ). h. After imaging, carefully separate the coverslip from the slide. Be sure to do this under the microscope so that you can keep track of multiple optic nerves. Put the optic nerves back into 50 μL of Mount Clear, wrap tubes in foil, and store at 4 °C. Samples can be reimaged and reused several times if needed. i. Rinse parafilm rig with ddH 2 O and store for future re-use. Figure 6. Image of the whole optic nerve. Confocal z-projection image of stitched Z stacks of an entire optic nerve from a mouse with biotin injected intravitreally. Anti-biotin is shown in red (A), and GFP expressed under control of the mapt promotor is shown in green (B); (C) shows the merged image. The darker stripes across the optic nerve are the result of photobleaching in the overlapping areas during large image stitching. We have found that the Alexa-568 and the endogenous GFP photobleach at the same rate, making red:green ratios consistent across different regions of the sample. Scale bar, 1 mm. Figure 7. Confocal images of biotinylated proteins in the optic nerve. Single optical section of a whole-mount immunolabeled optic nerve from a mapt- GFP mouse with biotin injected intravitreally. Biotin is shown in red and GFP in green (A, B). GFP fluorescence is maintained in the samples using this protocol (A, A’). Biotinylated puncta can be visualized easily at 20× magnification on a confocal microscope (B, B’). Scale bars in B B’ also apply to A, A’.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research articles: • Schiapparelli et al. [1].

    "title": "Using a Live Analysis System to Study Amyloplast Replication in Arabidopsis Ovule Integuments.",
    "abstract": "Amyloplasts, non-photosynthetic plastids specialized for starch synthesis and storage, proliferate in storage tissue cells of plants. To date, studies of amyloplast replication in roots and the ovule nucelli from various plant species have been performed using electron and fluorescence microscopy. However, a complete understanding of amyloplast replication remains unclear due to the absence of experimental systems capable of tracking their morphology and behavior in living cells. Recently, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis ovule integument could provide a platform for live-cell imaging of amyloplast replication. This system enables precise analysis of amyloplast number and shape, including the behavior of stroma-filled tubules (stromules), during proplastid-to-amyloplast development in post-mitotic cells. Here, we provide technical guidelines for observing and quantifying amyloplasts using conventional fluorescence microscopy in wild-type and several plastid-division mutants of Arabidopsis. Key features • Novel approach for investigating amyloplast differentiation and replication in plant cells. • Detection of stroma-labeled amyloplasts in whole-mount ovules using conventional fluorescence microscopy. • Facilitates quantitative and comparative analysis of amyloplast proliferation using various Arabidopsis resources. • Enables high-resolution analysis of changing amyloplast and stromule morphologies in living cells.",

Sow seeds on Murashige and Skoog medium (pH 5.7) supplemented with 0.1% MES, 2% sucrose, and 0.7% agar (see General note 2). Treat the seeds in the dark at 4 °C for several days [9]. Germination occurs in one or several days after irradiation at 23 °C. After germination, transfer seedlings to Jiffy-7 peat pellets pre-soaked in water and grow under a 16/8 light/dark cycle of white light illumination at 23 °C for 5–6 weeks (see General note 2; Figure 1 ). 2. Prepare two glass slides. One (slide 1) is used for ovule extraction. The other (slide 2), together with 1–3 layers of colored tape as a spacer, is used for microscopy analysis (see General note 3). 3. Excise an intact flower or silique from an inflorescence stem of an adult plant (see General note 4). 4. Place the flower or silique (segment) on slide 1. Fix the organ in place using surgical tape by securing the pedicle at one point so that it does not move during dissection ( Figure 2A –E). Figure 2. Extraction of ovules for microscopic analysis.

Scale bars, 2 mm (A–D, F) and 100 μm (H, I). 5. To extract ovules from a silique at flower stages 16–17, remove sepals, petals, and stamens from the silique, if attached, using basic tweezers (tweezers 1) under a stereomicroscope at zoom 2.0–3.2×. Peel off either or both valves (this is optional) from the silique ( Figure 2A , B). 6. To extract ovules from a pistil at flower stages 13–16, remove sepals, petals, and stamens from an open flower using extra-fine tweezers (tweezers 2) under a stereomicroscope at zoom 6.3×. Peel off either or both valves (this is optional) from the pistil ( Figure 2C , D). 7. Apply 40–70 µL of deionized water or liquid Murashige and Skoog medium onto slide 2. Transfer a septum–ovule association obtained by dissection to the water drop ( Figure 2F ). 8. Mount a coverslip carefully onto the slide (see General note 5). Gently apply the mounting medium between the coverslip and the slide, so that it just fills the space between them ( Figure 2E ). 9. Confirm the extraction of intact ovules by low-magnification light microscopy ( Figure 2H , I). 10. Observe amyloplasts in outer ovule integument (epidermal or oi2 [12]) cells by high-magnification fluorescence microscopy using a 60×/1.20 NA water-immersion objective ( Figure 2G ; see section B). B. Observation of amyloplasts by conventional fluorescence microscopy 1. Turn on the halogen lamp, mercury lamp, camera controller (computer), and digital camera. 2. Place slide 2 on the stage of the inverted fluorescence microscope. 3. To perform counting and morphological characterization of amyloplasts, use a 60× water-immersion objective ( Figure 2G ). Microscope settings for the detection of YFP are described in Table 1 . 4. Start the camera controller software HCImage (Hamamatsu Photonics). The settings of the mercury lamp and camera for the detection of YFP fluorescence are described in Table 2 . 5. Explore and focus on individual ovules at 60× through eyepieces using differential interference contrast (DIC) optics. 6. Perform image acquisition ( Figures 3 –5).

    "title": "Quantifying Bacterial Chemotaxis in Controlled and Stationary Chemical Gradients with a Microfluidic Device.",
    "abstract": "Chemotaxis refers to the ability of organisms to detect chemical gradients and bias their motion accordingly. Quantifying this bias is critical for many applications and requires a device that can generate and maintain a constant concentration field over a long period allowing for the observation of bacterial responses. In 2010, a method was introduced that combines microfluidics and hydrogel to facilitate the diffusion of chemical species and to set a linear gradient in a bacterial suspension in the absence of liquid flow. The device consists of three closely parallel channels, with the two outermost channels containing chemical species at varying concentrations, forming a uniform, stationary, and controlled gradient between them. Bacteria positioned in the central channel respond to this gradient by accumulating toward the high chemoattractant concentrations. Video-imaging of bacteria in fluorescent microscopy followed by trajectory analysis provide access to the key diffusive and chemotactic parameters of motility for the studied bacterial species. This technique offers a significant advantage over other microfluidic techniques as it enables observations in a stationary gradient. Here, we outline a modified and improved protocol that allows for the renewal of the bacterial population, modification of the chemical environment, and the performance of new measurements using the same chip. To demonstrate its efficacy, the protocol was used to measure the response of a strain of Escherichia coli to gradients of α-methyl-aspartate across the entire response range of the bacteria and for different gradients. Key features • The protocol is based on a previously proposed system [1] that we improved for higher throughput. • Setup allowing a rapid quantification of motility and chemotaxis responses. • Seventeen hours were required from the start of an E. coli culture to the measurements to obtain the chemotactic velocity under various chemical conditions.

Add 5 mL of M9G medium and 5 μL of chloramphenicol stock solution into a double-position tube and vortex. 2. Inoculate the M9G medium with a small piece of ice scraped from the -80 °C glycerol stock of the E. coli strain and incubate overnight at 30 °C and 240 rpm. 3. When OD 600 ~0.1, transfer 1 mL of the culture into a microtube and centrifuge it at 10,000 rpm (7,378× g ) for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellets in 1 mL of Milli Q water. Centrifuge the microtube again at 10,000 rpm (7,378× g ) for 5 min. Remove the Milli Q water and resuspend the bacteria in 1 mL of motility buffer. 4. Measure the OD 600 with the spectrophotometer and adjust the suspension to an OD 600 ~0.08 by adding the appropriate volume of motility buffer. The scarcity of carbon source maintains the OD 600 for more than 3 h, and the suspension is still motile after 1 day in a closed microtube. B. Fabrication of the microfluidic chip 1. Negative imprint of channels in photosensitive resin on a wafer for PDMS molding. The manufacturing of the wafer requires a photolithography platform that can be found in nanotechnology laboratories. We used the C2N (Centre des Nanosciences et des Nanotechnologies) facilities to realize the imprint. The height of the channels is set by the thickness of the SU8 resin spin-coated onto a 4-inches silicon wafer. The experiments reported here were carried out with 117 μm high channels. This method can achieve smaller heights by adjusting the spin-coater rotation speed and resin viscosity. When the resin is exposed to UV light, it polymerizes, attaches to the surface of the wafer, and becomes solid. To fix the resin where the channels will be present, a photomask must be placed between the UV lamp and the wafer on which the resin is deposited. The photomask must be printed using a very high-resolution printer to achieve good spatial resolution. Selba produced our photomask with a 25,400 dpi resolution. The channels printed on the photomask were designed on Inkscape, and the SVG file was provided to the company. The SVG file can be downloaded here . Several geometries are available in the file and can be used to make the microfluidic cell. We have used the one where the channels are 600 μm wide and 200 μm apart. 2. Molding of the PDMS channels. a. Mix 100 mL of PDMS monomer and curing agent with a spatula in a 100 mL beaker for 1–2 min. Remove the bubbles generated during mixing by placing the beaker in a vacuum chamber. b. Cover the bottom of a Petri dish with a plastic film and aluminum foil. This will make it easier to release the molding. Carefully place the wafer inside and pour the degassed PDMS onto it. If there are any remaining bubbles, use a scalpel to remove them. Place the Petri dish in an incubator for at least 3 h at 60 °C allowing the polymerization of the PDMS. c. Unmold the PDMS and cut out the area containing the channels. The side on which the channels are molded can be protected from dust by placing the piece of PDMS on a cleaned glass surface. Eventual dust deposited on the PDMS surface should be removed by pressing and removing a piece of tape on the surface of the PDMS. d. To connect the chip to the pump and the reservoirs, make 2 mm radius holes with a biopsy punch at the enlarged extremities of the channels. Then, flexible tubings are inserted into the holes. The three output tubings, at one side of the channels, are connected to the pump; the three inlet tubings at the other side are dipped in a 100 mL water-filled Erlenmeyer. The whole procedure is shown in Video 1 . Video 1. Preparing the PDMS molding 3. Preparation of the agar layer. a. Place a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 10 mL of 3% agar gel in a boiling water bath until fully dissolved. b. To obtain a thin flat surface of an agar gel that will be subsequently used to contact the PDMS layer, use the following procedure: (i) Make a flat surface out of PDMS: pour PDMS into a Petri dish, then degas and place in the incubator as above before cutting a 6 × 6 cm piece. (ii) Place two 75 × 26 mm microscope slides on the PDMS surface. Make sure they are separated by 5 cm, with their long sides as parallel as possible. They act as spacers, and their thickness determines the final thickness of the agar layer. Use glass slides 1 mm thick; this thickness can be increased by layering multiple microscope slides. (iii) Pour a few milliliters of molten agar on the surface, then cover it with a 75 × 50 mm microscope slide. This operation is done by sliding the microscope slide slowly over the spacers to allow the drops to spread and evenly fill the space between both spacers. Then, place the ensemble in the fridge for 10 min. c. This operation produces a gel surface of agar, which needs to be transferred onto a microscope slide. First, take off the microscope slide placed on top of the agar. Then, scrutinize the agar layer to ensure the absence of imperfections. Slide the agar from the PDMS surface onto a new 75 × 50 mm microscope slide. Video 2 shows the whole procedure. Video 2. Preparing the agar layer 4. Making the microfluidic chip with the PDMS mold and the agar surface ( Figure 1 ). a. First, fill the tubings with water. To do so, use the pump or create a gravity flow with the Erlenmeyer. It is important to avoid leaving bubbles in the tubes. They may prevent the proper fluid flow in the channels of the microfluidic chip. b. Wet the agar layer with a few drops of water, then place the PDMS molding with the channels facing down on top of the agar layer. Press gently to avoid bubbles still trapped between the PDMS and the agar. The assembly can then be positioned on the microscope's moving stage. c. Withdraw water with the pump set at a 10 μL/min flow rate to remove the water layer between the PDMS molding and the agar. The pump can be used with the NemeSys software provided with the device. If the water layer is not removed within 1 min, use a syringe to suck the water manually by placing the syringe on the side of the chip. Once the water layer is removed, the PDMS and agar parts are in contact, and water flows equally through all three channels. Visualize the flow in brightfield mode by focusing the microscope on the channels at 10× magnification and taking advantage of particle impurities present in the liquids. There should be no particle movement at the contact areas between the PDMS and agar. d. The chip is ready for the experiment. Replace the Erlenmeyer filled with water with microtubes containing the chemoattractant and the bacteria. This is done by quickly removing the tubings from the Erlenmeyer and dipping them into the microtubes. Set the flow rate to 2 μL/min to purge the water from the tubings and fill them with the liquids. e. When the liquids arrive in the microfluidic chip (this takes 10 min for 50 cm long tubings), reduce the flow to 1 μL/min. Wait for the concentration gradient to form between the two outer channels. The gradient is established as the chemoattractant diffuses through the agar. We advise waiting for 30 min until the gradient is stationary. f. Adjust the microscope to view the central channel of the chip and focus on the fluid in the channel. Stop the flow in the central channel when the number of visible bacteria is constant. This takes less than 5 min. Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the microfluidic device. Microtubes C 1 and C 2 contain a chemoattractant solution at two different concentrations C 1 and C 2 . The central microtube contains the bacterial suspension. Microtubes C 3 and C 4 contain another pair of concentrations that can be studied after measurement with the first pair of microtubes. The top, middle, and bottom syringes contain the solutions withdrawn from the microtubes containing the chemoattractant at concentration C 1 and the chemoattractant at concentration C 2 . The central syringe chemoattractant concentration is c 1 + c 2 2 due to diffusion across the agar gel and the bacterial suspension. C. Setting the microscope to observe bacteria 1. Set the acquisition software to acquire with a 2 × 2 binning (this increases the image's brightness and eases the image treatment). Use a 20× magnification objective so that the field of view encompasses the entire width of the central channel. For a YFP-expressing strain, such as RP437, use an I3 fluorescence filter cube. Make the focus at the bottom of the channel. We found that 10 frames per second (fps) for 20 s is sufficient to perform the statistical analysis of the trajectories. 2. Start acquisition 20 min after step B4f. 3. Save the films as a LIF project (Leica Image File). 4. New gradients can be generated by changing microtubes A and C with microtubes containing new chemical concentrations. Repeat the protocol from step B4d. It is recommended to start with low concentrations and to increase them from one experiment to another to avoid bias due to the residual presence of chemoattractant.\n\nValidation of protocol We applied this protocol by placing a suspension of E. coli in the central channel between two channels containing 200 and 0 μM of α-methyl-aspartate in the motility buffer. We waited 30 min for the gradient to be established before starting to acquire the films. For this experiment, we then have c = 100 μM and ∇c = 200 μM/mm. Figure 3 shows the first image of three films recorded during the experiment. In the first image, the bacteria, which appear as white dots, are evenly distributed across the image. Figure 3. Images acquired at three different times (0, 16, and 50 min). The images show the central channels where the bacteria suspension was injected. The observation is done with a 20× objective. The bacteria appear as white dots. Over time, we can see that the bacteria have moved upward and are accumulating on the side closest to the channel containing the chemoattractant. After a few minutes, the bacteria are more numerous at the top of the image, on the side where the chemoattractant is present. This is shown quantitatively in Figure 4A , where we plotted the profiles b(y ) obtained after the image treatment. The adjustment of each profile by an exponential function gives a decay length that we plot as a function of the time at which the films were recorded ( Figure 4C ). The decay length changes very little over time, indicating that the bacterial concentration profile reaches a stationary regime within a few minutes and no longer evolves over time. The average decay length measured is λ = 130 ± 10 μm ( Figure 4C ). Figure 4. Data processing to obtain a chemotactic velocity. (A) Bacterial concentration profiles b(y ) and (B) velocity correlation function C y (Δt ) measured at three different times during one experiment. The solid lines are exponential fit that determine a) the decay length λ and b) the persistence time τ . (C) Time evolution of the decay length λ . (D) Time evolution of the diffusion D = v y 2 τ . (E) Chemotactic velocity v c obtained by Eq. (2) that combines the decay length λ and the diffusion coefficient D . The data are from an experiment with c = 100 μM and ∇c = 200 μM/mm. Next, each film was processed to determine the velocity correlation function C y (Δt ) (see Figure 4B ). Fitting it gives the correlation time τ , which, combined with the average velocity of the bacteria along the y-axis v y , gives the diffusion coefficient D = v y 2 τ . The diffusion coefficient as a function of time is shown in Figure 4D . The diffusion coefficient shows little variation over time; we obtained D = 260 ± 30 μm 2 /s. The accumulation length λ and diffusion coefficient D are then used to determine the chemotactic velocity v c for each film. This is shown as a function of time in Figure 4E . The chemotactic velocity also shows little variation with time; we found: v c =1.9 ± 0.4 μm/s. The experiment was continued with different concentrations c 1 and c 2 in the channels, which makes it possible to explore other pairs of parameters ( c,∇c ) and their influence on the chemotactic velocity. Figure 5 shows, in a log-log representation, the chemotactic susceptibility χ ( c ) = v c ∇ c as a function of c . Each point corresponds to one experiment. Outside the window of c represented in Figure 5 , no chemotactic responses were detected. The central part of the data are adjusted by a line indicating that over this region we have χ ( c ) ∝ χ 0 C with χ 0 = 490 ± 40 μm 2 /s/μM. Figure 5. Evolution of the chemotactic coefficient χ(c ) as a function of the average concentration c . For concentrations below 1 and above 10 4 μM, no chemotactic response was detected. Solid line: χ ( c ) = χ 0 c with χ 0 = 490 ± 40 μm 2 /s/μM.\n\nSupplementary information The following supporting information can be downloaded here : 1. File S1. Python Analysis script",

    "title": "Closed Systems to Study Plant-Filamentous Fungi Associations: Emphasis on Microscopic Analyses.",
    "abstract": "In nature, filamentous fungi interact with plants. These fungi are characterized by rapid growth in numerous substrates and under minimal nutrient requirements. Investigating the interaction of these fungi with their plant hosts under controlled conditions is of importance for many researchers aiming to proceed with molecular or microscopical investigations of their favorite plant-fungus interaction system. The speed of growth of these fungi complicates transferring plant-fungal interaction systems in laboratory conditions. The issue is more complicated when monoxenic conditions are desired, to ensure that only two members (a fungus and a plant) are present in the system under study. Here, two simple closed systems for investigating plant-filamentous fungi associations under laboratory, monoxenic conditions are described, along with their limitations. The plant and fungal growth conditions, methods for sampling, staining, sectioning, and subsequent microscopical imaging of colonized plant tissues with affordable, common laboratory tools are described. Key features • Setting up closed systems for microscopical observations of plant-filamentous fungi (emphasis on model legumes-Fusaria) associations and temporal in vivo observations of the association(s). • Preparing root samples for microscopical observations: staining, sectioning, and mounting on microscopical slides. • Using low-cost equipment for performing microscopical observations and imaging. • Using fluorescence microscopy: provision of common fluorophores to highlight specific plant and fungal tissues, compartments, and structures.",

Scarify and decontaminate L. japonicus seeds: Briefly, chemically scarify L. japonicus seeds with a ~12–20 min sulfuric acid treatment (by shaking the Eppendorf tube containing the seeds and sulfuric acid on a tube vortex mixer), wash thoroughly with deionized water, surface sterilize seeds for 20 min in a 20% v/v NaOCl solution, and wash 6× with sterile deionized water (see General note 2). 2. Keep seeds in water at 4 °C overnight in an Eppendorf tube covered with aluminum foil to promote seed germination. Afterward, place them in Petri dishes containing half-strength (1/2) MS medium [11] and transfer the Petri dishes to a growth chamber with a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod at 22 °C. In the following experimental procedures, 6–12-days-old L. japonicus plantlets are used. B. Fungal inoculum preparation 1. Perform routine culture of the selected Fusarium strain by inoculating a fresh potato dextrose agar plate with a small fungal plug from a previous fungal culture on the same medium. 2. Isolate fungal asexual reproductive spores (conidia) as follows. Inoculate a flask containing potato dextrose broth (100 mL) with a fungal plug from the periphery of the fungal colony of the routine culture of step 1. Allow the culture to grow for ~5 days (26–28 °C, 160 rpm). Filter the culture through a sterile cheesecloth (using a sterile glass funnel) to separate the fungal mycelium from fungal conidia. Centrifuge the culture filtrate containing the fungal conidia (4,000× g ), remove the supernatant, and resuspend the recovered conidia in a few milliliters of isotonic solution (0.85% w/v NaCl). 3. Dilute the suspension of fungal conidia appropriately and determine conidia concentration by using a Neubauer chamber and a compound light microscope [8] (see General note 3). Note: For FsK, conidia collected are initially diluted in ~5 mL of isotonic solution, and conidia concentration is determined in this solution using a Neubauer chamber. Conidia are further diluted to a working concentration of 100 conidia per 200 μL of isotonic solution (i.e., 500 conidia/mL). C. Preparation of the closed system(s) and plant inoculation C1. Closed systems in magenta boxes Use magenta boxes or glass jars when a closed system that mimics growth in pots is desired (see Figure 1 ) (see General notes 4 and 5). Figure 1. Lotus japonicus plants inoculated with (Α) Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) and (Β) F. solani strain K (FsK) and grown in glass jars purchased from glassware stores. In (Α), the non-transparent lid of the jar is omitted, and a square piece of Parafilm is used instead to cover the jar mouth, allowing uniform light diffusion toward plants and gas exchange. 1. Place approximately 150–200 mL of substrate (sand/vermiculite mixture, 2:1) in magenta boxes/jars. 2. Autoclave containers filled with the substrate (121 °C for 60 min) prior to use to ensure aseptic conditions. 3. Perform plant transplantation under the laminar flow hood. Use Hoagland nutrient medium [12,13] to irrigate the substrate, prior to plant transplantation, when normal conditions for plant growth are desired. Use ~50 mL of nutrient medium per ~150–200 mL of substrate (see General note 6 and Troubleshooting 1). Transplant ~7–12-days-old L. japonicus plants into magenta boxes by using sterile forceps. Transplant 2–3 healthy plants per magenta box. Consider each magenta box as a biological replicate. 4. Close the containers with their lids and transfer them to the growth chamber until further handling (see General notes 7 and 8). 5. Perform fungal inoculation in the laminar flow hood to avoid contamination. Use fungal conidia as inoculum (as prepared in section B) in this closed system. Fungal conidia are easily quantified with the use of a Neubauer chamber (see General note 9 and Troubleshooting 2). Note: For plant inoculations, a working concentration of 500 conidia/mL is used. Plants are inoculated by applying directly to the root 200 μL of inoculum (i.e., 100 conidia per root system). 6. Post fungal inoculation, close containers with their lids in the laminar flow hood and return them to the growth chamber until further experimental processing. C2. Closed system in Petri dishes Set the interaction system in square Petri dishes (see General note 10 and 11). 1. Perform plant transplantation under the laminar flow hood. Transfer ~7–12-day-old plants in square Petri dishes containing M medium (see General note 12) solidified with 0.4%–0.8% w/v agar under the laminar flow hood. Place Petri dishes containing the plants in the growth chamber at a ~45° angle (see General note 8). 2. Perform fungal inoculation in the laminar flow hood to avoid contamination from other microorganisms. In this closed system, use fungal hyphae from a previous fresh culture of the fungus in a PDA plate to inoculate the plants. Perform inoculations with a small fungal plug from a previous fresh fungal culture or a few fungal hyphae by scraping the surface of a previous fungal culture with a sharp sterile object such as the needle of a syringe. Inoculate at a spot close to the root, e.g., 1 cm underneath or close to the root tip (see Figure 2 ) (see General note 13). Note: It is recommended to avoid inoculation with a large number of fungal propagules. Figure 2. Square Petri dishes containing Lotus japonicus plants inoculated with Fusarium solani strain K (FsK). A few fungal hyphae from a previous routine fungal culture on solid medium was used to inoculate plants underneath the root tip using a sterile needle of a syringe. Scale bar: 1 cm. 3. Post fungal inoculation, close Petri dishes, seal them with Parafilm in the laminar flow hood, and return them to the growth chamber until further experimental processing. Place Petri dishes in a vertical position on the growth chamber shelves for optimal root growth. C3. Closed system to perform temporal, in vivo observations This section describes a non-destructive method for microscopical observations of colonized plants, appropriate for in vivo observations and cellular studies of the plant–fungal system using confocal microscopy (see Figure S1). Set the plant–fungal interaction in square Petri dishes, underneath a thin (25 μm) gas-permeable membrane that allows prolonged microscopical observations (see General note 14). Perform all manipulations for system setup in the laminar flow hood to avoid contamination from other microorganisms. 1. Transfer pre-grown L. japonicus plants (~7–12 days old) to square Petri dishes containing M medium solidified with 0.4% w/v agar. 2. Remove a small portion of the solidified medium close to the root tip with a sterile needle from a syringe. In the space created, place a few hyphae from a previous fresh fungal culture grown on solid medium with a sterile needle from a syringe. 3. Fix the inoculum under 1–3 drops of a 0.4% w/v low melting temperature agarose solution. Note: Allow the agarose solution to cool down before use. 4. Leave the agarose to solidify to ensure fixation of the inoculum (see Troubleshooting 3). 5. Pipette sterile water (~1 mL) around the roots and carefully cover the roots and the fungus with the gas-permeable plastic film, avoiding the entrapment of air bubbles underneath the film. 6. Seal Petri dishes with parafilm and wrap their lower part in aluminum foil to protect root tissues from light. 7. Place Petri dishes at a ~45° angle in a growth chamber (16/8 h light/dark photoperiod, 22 °C) until further handling. 8. Perform in vivo, temporal, and prolonged observations of the plant–fungal interaction directly on the Petri dish, using an upright (fluorescence) microscope by simply removing the Petri dish lid. No coverslip is needed for imaging. Tissues are directly observed underneath the gas-permeable plastic film [10,16] (see General notes 15 and 16). D. Sampling plant tissues 1. Collect tissues for further processing, e.g., for staining and microscopical analysis. Collect plants at ~20 days post inoculation (dpi) to test for intraradical fungal colonization by different Fusaria strains. Explant plants and wash root tissues with water to remove substrate particles. 2. Stain tissues right after harvest or store them temporarily (at 4 °C, in water) for up to 2–3 days until staining or store them in ethanol solution for long-term storage (see General notes 17 and 18). E. Staining of whole root/stem/leaf tissues to highlight fungal structures and mounting on microscope slides This section describes how to examine Fusarium fungal colonization in L. japonicus root/stem/leaves. For this purpose, a similar staining protocol as that used for staining arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonized roots is described [17,18]. 1. Prepare the stain by mixing the appropriate quantity of TB or CB with water, glycerol, and lactic acid (1:1:1 by volume). Caution: Wear protective gloves/protective clothing/personal protective equipment during all steps of handling the above-mentioned dyes. Ensure adequate ventilation and avoid dust formation. 2. Clear tissues (i.e., remove cytoplasmic contents from roots) at the beginning of the staining process: cut roots into 1–5 cm segments and clear them with 10% w/v KOH for 10–30 min at 95 °C in a water bath (see General note 19). 3. Rinse roots 4× with deionized water, acidify roots with 1 N HCl for 20 min at RT, and subsequently stain the root segments either with 0.05% w/v TB or 0.05% w/v CB for 3–4 min at 95 °C and for extra ~20 min at RT (see General notes 20 and 21). 4. Wash tissues 4–5× with deionized water and place them at 4 °C in water overnight to remove excess dye. 5. Place tissues/tissue segments on a microscope slide using fine forceps, making sure that tissue segments do not overlap. Add a drop (or the necessary amount) of Polyvinyl-Lacto-Glycerol (PVLG) or glycerol (50% v/v) right before the left edge of the specimen. Place the left edge of the coverslip over the left edge of the sample and carefully lower the coverslip, covering the whole sample and avoiding air bubbles. 6. Observe prepared slides immediately or, preferably, place PVLG-mounted slides in an oven at 40 °C for 24–36 h or at 60 °C overnight to harden sufficiently and create a permanently mounted specimen [19,20] prior to microscopical observations (see Figure 3 ) (see General notes 22 and 23). Figure 3. Lotus japonicus roots inoculated with different Fusaria strains and stained using three different stains: trypan blue (TB), chlorazol black (CB), and ink. The staining process for each stain is described in section E. (A–C) L. japonicus roots colonized by Fusarium solani strain K (FsK) at 27 dpi and stained with TB. The yellow triangles indicate FsK structures interacting with root hair or root epidermal cells. (D–F) L. japonicus roots colonized by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (Forl) at 23 dpi and stained with CB. The yellow triangles indicate Forl spore-like structures on root epidermal cells. (G–I) L. japonicus roots colonized by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) (G–H) or Forl (I) at 27 dpi and stained using the ink and vinegar method. The yellow triangles indicate (G) Fol propagules-like structures in a root hair cell, (H) Fol structures and propagules in a root cell, and (I) Forl hyphae on the epidermis of L. japonicus roots. Scale bars: 25 μm. F. Embedding in agarose and sectioning Prepare root and/or stem sections (transverse or longitudinal) to investigate the exact microbial location and progression within plant tissues and the changes occurring in either partner. Fungal location within delicate leaf tissues can be observed on intact tissues. Prepare sections for microscopic analysis using a free-hand method. Pre-treat tissues for free-hand sectioning: soft and delicate tissues are easily destroyed if not embedded on a medium that acts as a scaffold, thus providing mechanical support and allowing maintenance of tissues/structures integrity. Such media can be agarose or paraffin (see General note 24). This section describes how to perform sections by embedding tissues in agarose and performing sections by hand (see General note 25) (see Figure S2). 1. Prepare a 6%–8% w/v agarose solution. Melt the agarose solution and place it in a hot water bath until use. 2. Use commercial silicone rubber flat embedding molds (see General note 26). Segment roots/stems and place them in the mold cavities (one segment per cavity) with forceps. Note: Align roots/stems in the center of each cavity (parallel to the length of the cavity), because after pouring the agarose, it is difficult to make further adjustments. 3. Allow the agarose solution to cool down near the point of solidification prior to embedding. Cover tissues with agarose by using a plastic Pasteur pipette cut at its end to ensure a larger opening, since the solution is viscous. Note: Pay attention not to introduce air bubbles while pouring the agarose into the cavities containing the roots. Allow the agarose to solidify at room temperature. 4. After the agarose has solidified, remove agarose blocks from cavities and start sectioning the blocks containing the tissue segments using a sharp razor blade (see General notes 27 and 28). 5. Maintain sections until immediate use in deionized water (e.g., in a small Petri dish or on a microscope slide in 1–2 drops of water). 6. Place (stained) sections (see General notes 29 and 30) on a microscope slide with a drop of water or glycerol (50%–90% v/v) (see General note 31) and cover with a cover slip for observations under the microscope. G. Embedding in paraffin wax and sectioning This section describes how to perform sections by embedding tissues in paraffin wax and performing sections using a hand microtome (see General notes 32–34) (see Figure S3). To build a hand microtome, use a bolt and nut (~2 cm in depth). 1. Cut root/stem tissues in segments (making sure segments are a bit longer than the length of the nut) and maintain them in water until use. 2. Screw the bolt in the nut just for a few turns so that a space with closed bottom (a well) is created inside the nut. 3. Place some flakes of paraffin wax in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and place tubes in a water bath at ~55 °C to melt the paraffin wax (see General note 35) (see Figure S3). 4. Position the hand microtome vertically (with the head of the bolt on the bottom) at a straight surface close to the water bath. Place a segment of root/stem tissue inside the nut and keep it with forceps (or with the aid of the forefinger) at its center and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the nut. 5. Quickly drop the melted wax inside the hand microtome. If necessary, place more melted wax to completely cover the well inside the nut. Allow the paraffin wax to harden at room temperature. Note: Perform this step fast because melted wax hardens quickly at room temperature. 6. After the wax is solidified, use a sharp razor blade to remove and throw the excess wax from the upper top of the hand microtome (see Figure S3). 7. Turn the bolt slightly clockwise (less than a quarter of a full turn) to expose a small portion of the wax cylinder containing the root at its center. Perform a quick and precise section with a sharp razor blade by holding the blade perpendicularly to the wax cylinder containing the tissue (see Troubleshooting 4). Note: Consider that the smaller the turn of the bolt, the thinner the section of the tissue. Perform a second section by slightly turning the bolt clockwise once again and so on. 8. Add 1–2 drops of water in a microscope slide and collect sections directly on the slide using fine point forceps or a pre-wet brush. 9. If necessary, remove the excess wax to expose the tissue section. This can be done with the aid of a dissecting (inoculation) needle under the stereoscope, as sections (especially root sections) are rather small and cannot be easily handled with the naked eye. 10. Stain tissues after embedding in paraffin and sectioning (see General note 30). 11. Place stained sections on a microscope slide with a drop of water or glycerol (50%–90% v/v) (see General note 31), and cover with a cover slip for observations under the microscope. H. Microscopy 1. Observe prepared specimens under a compound light microscope and proceed with imaging using a microscope-mounted camera and the appropriate computer software for image acquisition (see Figure 3 ). 2. Use an epifluorescence microscope when fluorescent dyes are used to highlight specific plant tissues and compartments, fungal cells, and structures. 3. If accessible, use a confocal microscope to reject out-of-focus light from the image, for sharper images of cells and cellular structures without background fluorescence (see Figure 4 ) and for in vivo cellular studies. Figure 4. Staining of endodermal suberization in Lotus japonicus root tissues inoculated with a Fusarium strain using the suberin-specific Fluorol Yellow (FY) stain. (A) FY-stained L. japonicus whole mount roots inoculated with the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transformed isolate of Fusarium solani strain K (strain F9a) [10]. A single optical section is shown. (B) Maximum intensity z-axis projection of serial optical sections of the same root tissues shown in (A) . L. japonicus plants (6 days old) were inoculated with F9a strain. Root tissues were harvested at 6 days post fungal inoculation and stained with FY using a lactic acid–based protocol, as described in Barberon et al. [21] and Shukla et al. [22]. Optical sections were collected using a Zeiss LSM800 system. Root tissues were imaged using the Ar laser band at 488 nm and a 500–550 nm emission window for FY fluorescence. Ep: epidermis; co: parenchymatic cortex; en: endodermis; white asterisks: passage cells. Scale bars: 50 μm. I. Preparation of samples for fluorescence microscopy Most cellular components are colorless; most molecules making up the cell do not absorb any specific wavelength of light, and therefore cannot be distinguished under the compound light microscope. A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that takes advantage of the physical properties of fluorophores (or fluorochromes): molecules that absorb light energy at a specific wavelength and re-emit it at higher wavelengths. This property of these molecules is called fluorescence, which can be visualized, recorded, and analyzed. Because the excitation and emission wavelengths differ, the absorbed and emitted by the fluorophore light are detectable in different areas (and therefore colors) of the spectrum and can thus be distinguished. In a fluorescence microscope, the specimen is illuminated with a specific wavelength of light; the fluorophores within the specimen absorb the light and emit it at a longer wavelength, which typically falls within the visible or near-visible range of the spectrum. Specific filters separate the excitation light (high energy light) from the emission light (lower energy light) which is seen by the eye or captured by the detector. The detected fluorescence enables researchers to obtain spatial and functional information on cells/cellular components that have been stained/tagged with the fluorophore(s), among non-fluorescing material [23]. Some common types of fluorophores are: • Many autofluorescent compounds, naturally occurring in plants, especially plant cell wall substances (examples of autofluorescent compounds in plants are phenols, lignin, suberin, etc.). • Synthetic organic dyes (such as fluorescein) • Biological fluorophores [fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP)] • Fluorescent dyes conjugated to target molecules (such as antibodies, proteins, peptides, etc.), which are used to label specific cellular components/compartments • Quantum dots (nanocrystals that when excited, emit fluorescence at a wavelength based on the size of the particle) [23–25] In this respect, in case experimental aims require the use of fluorophores to highlight specific plant tissues and compartments, fungal cells, and structures, a fluorescence microscope should be used (see Figure 4 and Troubleshooting 5). In Table 1 , a brief summary of common fluorophores used in the literature is presented, which may be used to highlight specific plant tissues and compartments, fungal cells, and structures. Table 1.

    "title": "Production of Genetically Engineered Extracellular Vesicles for Targeted Protein Delivery.",
    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising carriers for the targeted delivery of therapeutic proteins to specific cells. Previously, we demonstrated that genetically engineered EVs can be used for targeted protein delivery. This protocol details the generation of mannose receptor (CD206)-targeted EVs using a modular plasmid system optimized for production in HEK293T cells. Three plasmids enable customizable EV budding, cargo loading, and surface modification for targeting to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). EVs are isolated via differential centrifugation and chromatography, characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and validated through functional uptake assays in primary human activated dendritic cells. Our approach combines flexibility in engineering required EVs with robust, reproducible isolation and characterization workflows. Its modularity allows easy adaptation to alternative targets or cargoes, which can be validated immediately through in vitro testing. Key features • First detailed protocol for generating genetically engineered EVs with fusogenic VSV-G protein and CD206-specific targeting. • Enables rapid customization of EVs for diverse therapeutic cargo and cell-targeting applications. • Integrates gold-standard EV isolation with multi-modal characterization to ensure reliability. • A universal platform for customizable cell targeting: swapping VSV-G-linked llama nanobodies with diverse specificities.",

Construction of required plasmids Three plasmids are required to obtain genetically encoded EVs: 1) truncated_VSV-G_VHH_pCMV ( Figure 1 ) 2) cargo-protein-Jun_pCMV ( Figure 2 ) 3) EPN-Fos_pCMV . EPN-Fos_pCMV plasmid is available through the Addgene plasmid repository (https://www.addgene.org/167306/). Truncated_VSV-G_VHH_pCMV and cargo-protein-Jun_pCMV should be customized for users’ specific experimental requirements. A1. Cloning strategy for truncated_VSV-G_VHH_pCMV ( Figure 1 ) 1. Generation of truncated_VSV-G_pCMV a. Replace the region of the full-length VSV-G gene ( https://www.addgene.org/80054/ ) between the BstBI and MfeI restriction sites with a truncated form amplified using the primers: Forward primer: 5′- CATTGGGGTGAATTGCTTCGGAAGTCAGGTGCAGCTGCAGG -3′ Reverse primer: 5′- CGTCTTGAATGTGAGGATGTTCGAAGCTGCCTCCTCCTGAGCT -3′ Note: Although this resulting truncated VSV-G (UniProt: P03522 a.a. 1–16, 421–511) loses its ability to bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and independently attach to mammalian cells, it remains sufficient for efficient vesicle budding and retains fusogenic activity to mediate EV cargo release into the cytoplasm of target cell via fusion with the endosomal membrane after endocytosis [20] . 2. Generation of VHH-encoding PCR product a. Obtain a synthetic DNA fragment encoding the VHH, flanked by 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences precisely complementary to the linearized ends of the truncated_VSV-G_pCMV vector backbone, enabling directional assembly: 5′ complementary region: CATTGGGGTGAATTGCTT 3′ complementary region: CGAACATCCTCACATTC Note: For an effective anti-CD206 VHH, we recommend using clone 26.7, as previously published [19,21] . 3. Assembly of final truncated_VSV-G_VHH_pCMV plasmid a. Linearize the intermediate truncated_VSV-G_pCMV with BstBI (intermediate plasmid). BstBI restriction site is located within the truncated VSV-G coding sequence, specifically between the region encoding the native signal peptide (UniProt P03522 , a.a. 1–16) and the region encoding the C-terminal domains of full-sized VSV-G (part of the membrane-proximal domain, the full transmembrane domain, and the cytosolic tail; a.a. 421–511). b. Assemble the linearized plasmid and VHH-encoding fragment using HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix. Figure 1. Cloning strategy for truncated_VSV-G_VHH_pCMV EVs packing plasmid A2. Cloning strategy for Cargo-protein-Jun_pCMV ( Figure 2 ) 1. Digest the pCMV backbone plasmid ( https://www.addgene.org/167308/ ) with HindIII/KpnI. 2. Flank the cargo protein–encoding sequence with HindIII (3′) and KpnI (5′) restriction sites. 3. Digest nucleotide sequence encoding cargo-protein with HindIII/KpnI. 4. Ligate the gene encoding cargo-protein into the linearized backbone. Notes: 1. During the optimization of EV production, NanoLuc luciferase can serve as a model cargo protein due to its small size (~19 kDa) and high sensitivity for quantification. Any protein <30 kDa can substitute NanoLuc. Proteins larger than 30 kDa may load inefficiently into EPNs and EVs due to steric hindrance, and their loading efficiency requires individual validation. Further studies are needed to systematically explore the loading of larger proteins. 2. For western blot or flow cytometry, incorporate a 3xFLAG/HA/Myc tag into the cargo protein sequence. 3. NanoLuc-Jun_ pCMV plasmid is available through the Addgene plasmid repository ( https://www.addgene.org/167308/ ). Figure 2. Cloning strategy for Cargo-protein-Jun_pCMV B. EV production in HEK293T cells The HEK293T cell line was grown in complete DMEM medium in standard cell culture flasks until 80%–90% confluency and was harvested by trypsinization. 1. Aspirate the medium from the culture and wash the adherent cells with sterile 1× PBS. After washing, add Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) solution (0.5 mL for T25 flask and 1.5 mL for T75 flask), gently swirl, and incubate at 37 °C for 2 min. 2. Inspect the cells using a microscope. Ensure that at least 90% of cells are detached; incubate the flask longer if necessary. 3. Once cells appear detached, add 2.5 mL of complete DMEM medium and resuspend cells. 4. Inspect the cells using a microscope. If cells are clumped, resuspend and inspect the cells again. 5. Count cells with trypan blue. 6. Seed HEK293T cells at 5 × 10 5 cells/mL in 15 mL of complete DMEM medium in a T75 flask and incubate overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . 7. The next day, aspirate the medium and replace it with 13.5 mL of fresh complete DMEM. 8. Prepare transfection mixes as described in Table 1 . Table 1. Composition of the transfection reagent mixture Component Quantity Details DNA mix (1.5 mL tube) EPN-Fos_pCMV 13.5 μg Self-assembling nanocages encoded plasmid ( https://www.addgene.org/167306/ ) Cargo-protein-Jun_pCMV 7.5 μg Cargo-protein encoded plasmid (e.g., NanoLuc-Jun_pCMV https://www.addgene.org/167308/ ) Truncated_VSV-G_VHH_pCMV 1.5 μg Budding-competent VSV-G encoded plasmid P3000 reagent 45 μL Included in Lipofectamine 3000 kit Opti-MEM medium 750 μL Serum-free medium for dilution Lipofectamine mix (1.5 mL tube) Lipofectamine 3000 42 μL Transfection reagent Opti-MEM medium 750 μL Serum-free medium for dilution Note: GenJect39 can replace Lipofectamine 3000. Use identical DNA amounts with 45 μL of GenJect39 reagent. 9. Combine the DNA Mix and Lipofectamine Mix in a 1:1 ratio; use the vortex. 10. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature (RT). 11. Add the transfection mixture dropwise to the cells and gently swirl the flask. 12. Incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 6 h. 13. Aspirate the transfection medium and replace it with complete DMEM (exo-free FBS). 13. Incubate cells for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for EVs production. C. EV isolation Note: Perform all centrifugations at 4 °C. Harvest EVs: 1. Carefully pipette the EV-containing medium using a serological pipette, without disturbing the cells. 2. Transfer medium into a 15 mL conical tube. 3. Centrifuge medium at 300× g for 10 min to pellet cells. 4. Transfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL tube in a single, smooth motion. 5. Centrifuge the supernatant at 4,000× g for 15 min to remove cell debris. 6. Transfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL tube in a single, smooth motion. 7. Pass the supernatant through a 0.45 μm PES filter to remove microparticles. Concentrate and wash EVs: 8. Transfer filtered medium to an Amicon Ultra-15 100 kDa centrifugal filter unit. 9. Centrifuge at 4,000× g for 7–10 min at 10 °C until the volume is reduced to ~1–1.5 mL. 10. Discard the flowthrough. 11. Add 14 mL of 1× PBS (pre-cooled to 4 °C) to the filter unit to dilute the concentrate and wash EVs; resuspend carefully. 12. Centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 7–10 min until the volume is ~1–1.5 mL. 13. Discard the flowthrough. 14. Repeat the wash cycle (add 1× PBS and centrifuge) twice (total of 3 washes). 15. After the final wash, thoroughly resuspend the concentrate within the filter unit to wash away any EVs adhering to the membrane. 16. Centrifuge at 4,000× g for 1–2 min and adjust the final volume to 200–500 μL with PBS for downstream applications. Note: EVs may adhere to the Amicon filter membrane. To recover adherent EVs, wash the membrane with 100 μL of PBS after sample collection and combine this wash with the collected sample. D. EV purification 1. Connect the Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column and a 0.2–0.5 mL loop to the chromatography system. 2. Wash the column with 1 column volume (CV) of Milli-Q water at 0.3 mL/min, then increase the flow rate to 0.5 mL/min. 3. Pre-equilibrate the column with 2 CV of 1× PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 4. Inject the EV concentrate onto the column using a 0.2–0.5 mL loop or direct injection port. 5. Maintain a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and a maximum pressure of 1.5 MPa to preserve column integrity. 6. Start collecting 500 μL fractions in low-protein-binding tubes (Eppendorf Protein LoBind), beginning at an elution volume of 5 mL (post-void volume). 7. Continue collection until a 12 mL elution volume. Note: Track elution profiles using UV absorbance (280 nm) to identify EV peaks (typically eluting between 5.5 and 6.5 mL). 8. If multiple vesicle types require purification, a minimum flush volume of 1.5 CV of PBS must be performed between each run to prevent cross-contamination. 9. After finalizing the run, wash the column with 2 CV of Milli-Q water to remove residual particles, proteins, and contaminants, preserving column performance for subsequent use. 10. Store the column in 20% ethanol (v/v) at 4 °C to prevent bacterial growth. E. EV characterization E1. NanoLuc luciferase activity Note: To obtain numerical characteristics of NanoLuc loading into EVs, utilize recombinant NanoLuc with a known concentration. 1. Thaw the Nano-Glo luciferase assay buffer at RT. 2. Dilute recombinant NanoLuc. Prepare a 5-fold dilution series in PBS 0.1% BSA starting from 150 pg/mL (e.g., 150, 30, 6, 1.2, 0.24, 0.048 pg/mL). 3. Dilute EV samples in PBS 0.1% BSA (typically 1:100–1:1,000) to fit the linear range. 4. Calculate reagent volumes: Total volume = (# samples + standards + controls) × 15 μL + 10% excess. Example: 3 EV samples + 6 standards + 1 PBS control = 165 μL (10 × 15 μL + 10%). 5. Mix 1:50 (v/v) Nano-Glo luciferase assay substrate:buffer (e.g., 3.3 μL of substrate + 161.7 μL of buffer for a 165 μL total). Critical: Prepare fresh for each assay; avoid prolonged light exposure. 6. Add 15 μL of diluted sample to a well of a black 384-well plate. 7. Add 15 μL of Nano-Glo working solution to each well. Mix by pipetting 2–3 times and avoid bubbles. 8. Incubate at RT for 5 min to stabilize the signal. 9. Use a plate reader (e.g., Varioskan LUX) to detect the bioluminescence signal at 460 nm (peak emission wavelength of NanoLuc). 10. Plot calibration curves and calculate the NanoLuc luciferase content in vesicles. E2. BCA assay 1. Prepare BSA standards: dilute the 2 mg/mL BSA stock to create a standard curve (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mg/mL) in 1× PBS. 2. Prepare BCA working reagent by mixing reagent A and reagent B (50:1 ratio). 3. Add 25 μL of each standard/sample to triplicate wells. 4. Add 200 μL of BCA working reagent to each well. 5. Cover the plate with the seal and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. 6. Read absorbance at 562 nm using a plate reader (e.g., Varioskan LUX). 7. Calculate protein concentration. Note: For improved specificity in EV protein quantification, EV-specific kits such as the CBQCA Plus Protein Quantitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number: C-6667) are recommended. E3. Western blot 1. Prepare samples: For EV concentrates, load 20 μg total protein per lane; for SEC eluates, load 22.5 μL (maximum well capacity). 2. Mix samples with Laemmli buffer at 1:4 (v/v). Heat at 95 °C for 5 min. 3. Run SDS-PAGE on a polyacrylamide gel (typically 12%–15%). 4. Transfer proteins onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 h in transfer buffer. 5. Incubate the membrane in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. 6. Incubate the membrane with HRP-conjugated antibodies against EV markers (e.g., anti-CD63, anti-TSG101, anti-ApoB) or epitope tags (e.g., anti-FLAG, anti-HA), according to the manufacturers' protocols. 7. Rinse the membrane 6 times with PBS-T (5–10 min per wash). 8. Apply Clarity Western ECL substrate evenly to the membrane. 8. Image chemiluminescence using a gel documentation system ( Figure 3 ). Note: It may take up to 10 min of exposition to obtain a specific signal from vesicles. Figure 3. Western blot analysis of VSV-G-FLAG, actin, and GAPDH in extracellular vesicle (EV) samples. The truncated VSV-G lacks the 3xFLAG epitope, in contrast to the full-length VSV-G. The C+ natural EV control was isolated by ultracentrifugation from the culture media of HEK293T cells. Note: To effectively characterize EVs and confirm the purity of preparations, western blot analysis is strongly advised. The incorporation of an epitope tag (e.g., 3xFLAG in full-length VSV-G) provides a specific handle for EV detection. It is highly recommended to confirm the presence of EV-specific positive markers, such as tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81), ESCRT-related proteins (TSG101, ALIX), or Syntenin-1, HSP70, and Flotillin-1. Additionally, EV preparations should be tested for the absence of negative markers, such as Calnexin or ApoB, to evaluate potential contamination from common sources [17]. E4. Nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA) of EV samples 1. Prepare the instrument, the syringe, and particle-free 1× PBS for the measurement as described in section F. Note: This step may take more than 1 h. If the EV sample is frozen, do not thaw it until step E4.3 to minimize the storage time at positive temperatures. If the EV sample is not frozen, keep it at 4 °C. 2. Set the following camera parameters in Advanced mode: camera shutter: 850, camera gain: 450, lower threshold: 910, higher threshold: 10920. Note: These parameters are only valid for an NTA instrument with a 405 nm 65 mW laser unit and a high-sensitivity camera of the EMCCD type. For other NTA instrument configurations, setups differ strongly. 3. The EV sample volume should be 70 μL or more. Note: If less sample volume is available, dilute it with particle-free 1× PBS to a total volume of at least 70 μL. Include the dilution factor in subsequent calculations. 4. Use the first 20 μL aliquot for estimation of proper sample dilution with particle-free 1× PBS to reach the optimal particle concentration of around 1.5 × 10 8 particles/mL (see section F for details). 5. Use the second 20 μL aliquot to dilute the sample with particle-free 1× PBS using the estimated dilution factor (total volume of diluted sample should be 2 mL) and introduce the diluted sample into the instrument sample chamber to the 1.4 mL syringe plunger position. Connect the temperature probe; set up the microscope stage position and focus of the instrument. Record and save a 60 s long video without processing. Enter the temperature readings when asked. 6. Gently advance the syringe plunger to position 1.2 mL, set up the microscope stage position and focus of the instrument, and record the second video. Repeat the procedure for plunger positions 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 mL. Discard all intermediate dilutions, except for the stock sample. 7. Use the third 20 μL aliquot to repeat steps E4.5 and 6. 9. Process all 14 recorded videos with the following parameters in basic mode: detection threshold = 9 (Multi), MinExpectedParticleSize = 30 nm; all other parameters are kept in Automatic mode. In order to average the results over 14 repeated measurements, processing could be made in batch mode. 10. Multiply the resulting average concentration by the dilution factor used (including the preliminary dilution in step E4.3). 11. If any further samples are to be measured, rinse the syringe and the sample chamber twice with particle-free 1× PBS. On the second rinse, check the purity as described in section F. If the syringe passes the purity test, it could be used for measurement of the next sample. 12. After the last sample, service the instrument according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. E5. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Note: It is recommended to assess EV concentration by NTA prior to TEM analysis. Concentrations lower than 10 10 particles/mL are often insufficient to achieve the surface coverage required for manual TEM measurement. 1. Treat carbon-coated TEM grids with glow discharge at 25–30 mA for 45 s to render the surface hydrophilic. Use the grids immediately after treatment. 2. Place a 10 μL drop of the EV sample onto a clean piece of Parafilm. Adsorb the EVs for 2–3 min by floating the grid on top of the drop, with the discharge-treated side toward the solution. 3. Stain with UA (two 10 μL drops, 1–2 min each, blot gently between the steps). 4. Remove the UA solution and air-dry the grid for 10–15 min. 5. Acquire the TEM images at 100–120 kV acceleration voltage and 30,000×–150,000× magnification. The stained EVs typically exhibit cup-shaped morphology ( Figure 4 ). 6. The sizes of individual EVs can be measured using ScanEV [22] or Fiji [23]. Figure 4. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with full-length VSV-G and truncated VSV-G fused with α-CD206 (clone 26.7 [21]). EVs have cup-shaped morphology. F. (Additional) Prerequisites for nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) An optimal nanoparticle concentration for NTA measurements is of the order of 10 8 particles/mL, which is below the nanoparticle contamination level in typical laboratory routines. While the original EV sample could be handled as usual, special attention should be paid to the procedures related to finally diluted samples (those introduced into the instrument) to avoid nanoparticle contamination. This section describes some routines that help to avoid different sources of contamination during NTA measurements. 1. Laboratory plastics None of the laboratory plastics manufacturers specifies their products for nanoparticle contamination. From our experience, nanoparticle contamination for the items listed below was consistently low in every batch tested. Any other brands should be tested with NTA prior to use. a. Pipette tips from Eppendorf, Corning, and Greiner are nanoparticle-free. b. 2 mL PP tubes from Eppendorf, SSI, and Axygen are nanoparticle-free. c. 5 mL PP tubes from Eppendorf are nanoparticle-free. d. 15- and 50-mL PP tubes are typically more contaminated than small-volume tubes. Eppendorf and Corning are recommended after a double-rinse with fresh Milli-Q water. e. 2 mL syringes from any brand are typically contaminated to some extent. The contamination could worsen during prolonged storage. Extensive rinsing is required before use. 2. Mixing Harsh mixing (vortexing, intense shaking) could tear off particles from the tube walls. These procedures should be avoided for Milli-Q water, 1× PBS, and diluted samples. Use gentle pipetting or gentle multiple upside-down turning instead. Fifteen slow turns are enough for 15- and 50-mL tubes, while 25–30 turns are required for fully filled 2 mL tubes. 3. Glass bottle for Milli-Q water NTA measurements typically require around 200 mL of Milli-Q water free of contaminating nanoparticles for syringe and sample chamber rinse and 10× PBS dilution. It is a good practice to dedicate a separate 250- or 500-mL glass reagent bottle with GL45-type PP cap for NTA to keep it clean and particle-free. a. Wash the new bottle and its cap thoroughly with laboratory glassware detergent and bottle brush to remove the residuals of production oils and lubricants. b. Rinse the bottle and the cap with excess tap water to remove the detergent, then rinse with distilled or Milli-Q water. Close the cap and dry outside with a paper towel. Do not touch the inner surfaces of the bottle or the cap from now on. c. Fill the bottle with Milli-Q water from the apparatus, close the cap, and shake slightly, then empty the bottle. Repeat this final rinse 3–5 times. d. Fill the bottle with Milli-Q water from the apparatus and avoid harsh shaking from now on. Avoid tilting the filled bottle as the neck is typically the most contaminated part. Note: If the bottle is dedicated to NTA only, there is no need to wash it every time. Store it filled with Milli-Q water at room temperature in a dark place. On the day of the measurement, empty it, rinse 2–3 times as described in step F3c, and fill with fresh Milli-Q water as described in step F3d. Wash the bottle according to steps F3a–d every 3–4 months or if contamination is suspected. 4. PBS 1× NTA measurements require particle-free 1× PBS for syringe and instrument sample chamber rinse, and also for EV samples dilution. PBS tablets typically result in particle-contaminated PBS. The most reliable way is to prepare 1× PBS from particle-free Milli-Q water (see above) and Gibco 10× PBS pH 7.4, which is typically particle-free as well. Avoid PBS 10× flask shaking since its arrival and dedicate it to NTA only. Note: Always prepare 1× PBS from 10× PBS on the day of measurement and only after the Milli-Q water in the bottle has been confirmed to be particle-free. Discard any unused 1× PBS at the end of the day. 5. Pre-measurement protocol Due to multiple possible sources of nanoparticle contamination, the following procedure is recommended at the beginning of NTA measurement day to ensure that the water, 1× PBS, syringe, and sample chamber of the instrument are free of contaminating nanoparticles. a. Prepare a glass bottle with fresh Milli-Q water as described above. b. Take a new self-standing 50 mL PP centrifuge tube (see Laboratory supplies and considerations on laboratory plastic listed in step F1) and rinse it twice with Milli-Q water from the apparatus. Fill it with Milli-Q water. This tube will be used for syringe and instrument sample chamber rinsing. c. Assemble the laser unit of the NTA instrument, start the NTA software, initialize the camera, and set the following camera setups in Advanced mode: camera shutter: 850, camera gain: 450, lower threshold: 910, higher threshold: around 6000. Note: These parameters are only valid for the NTA instrument with a 405 nm 65 mW laser unit and a high-sensitivity camera of the EMCCD type. For other NTA instrument configurations, setups differ strongly. d. Unpack the syringe. Do not touch the vicinity of the Luer port, both on the syringe and on the needle, from now on. Assemble the needle. Slowly fill the syringe with water from the 50 mL PP tube and slowly empty it into the drain. Repeat the rinsing 4–5 times. Slowly fill the syringe with water and take out the needle. e. Introduce the water slowly into the laser unit to the 1.4 mL syringe plunger position. Set up the microscope stage position and focus of the instrument. Turn off the laser and wait for 5 min. Turn on the laser and visually inspect the presence of nanoparticles in the field of view using the video signal in NTA software. Slowly advance the syringe to plunger positions of 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2 mL, visually checking the presence of nanoparticles in each position. Note that the presence of nanoparticles in a flow during water advancement is unavoidable; the visual check is performed in a stop-flow mode in dedicated syringe plunger positions (the same positions will be used for sample measurement). The presence of less than 1 particle per field of view on average over 7 plunger positions is a criterion for acceptable purity of the water, syringe, and the instrument sample chamber. If a larger number of particles is observed, fill the syringe with water once again and repeat the check. Note: If repeating rinsing during 1 h does not reduce the amount of contaminating particles, then at least one component is heavily contaminated; either the water, the syringe, or the instrument sample chamber. Additional investigation is required to figure out which one. f. For one or two final water checks, take the water from the glass bottle instead of the 50 mL tube to ensure it is clean as well. g. Once the purity of the syringe, the instrument sample chamber, and the water in the bottle is ensured, 1× PBS could be prepared from this clean water and 10× PBS concentrate. Take a new self-standing 50 mL PP centrifuge tube (see Laboratory supplies and considerations on laboratory plastic listed in step F1), rinse it twice with Milli-Q water from the apparatus, and add 3 mL of 10× PBS using a pipette with a sterile pipette tip. Add 27 mL of water from the glass bottle. Do not shake. Instead, very gently rotate the tube upside down 10–15 times to mix the buffer. h. Check the purity of the prepared 1× PBS the same way as for water earlier. Use the same syringe. Note: The first portions of 1× PBS may appear to be contaminated. This happens because the ionic strength of the buffer is higher than that of the water, so additional electrostatically attached particles could desorb from the syringe or instrument sample chamber walls. Keep washing until a criterion of less than 1 particle per field of view, averaged over 7 plunger positions, is fulfilled. i. Once the purity of 1× PBS, the syringe, and the instrument chamber have been confirmed, proceed to sample measurement. Typically, the same syringe could be used for multiple samples. Double flush with 1× PBS with visual purity control in 7 syringe plunger positions, as described above, is enough between samples. 6. Selection of the proper sample dilution Although the claimed full particle concentration range for NTA is rather broad (from 10 7 to 10 9 particles/mL), the method operates best in a narrow range between 1.2 × 10 8 and 2.5 × 10 8 particles/mL. A proper sample dilution should be estimated prior to actual measurements. As long as the sample chamber has been carefully rinsed to ensure the absence of desorbing particles, the introduction of concentrated samples that could contaminate the chamber should be avoided. Thus, the selection of proper dilution is performed in the direction from the highest dilution (lowest particle concentration) to lower dilution. Given that 300,000-fold is the highest successful dilution used for EV samples in our experience, a reasonable starting point is 100,000-fold. The volume of each diluted sample for syringe filling should be 2 mL. 1. Dilute the first 20 μL aliquot of stock EV sample with particle-free 1× PBS 100 times in a 2 mL tube (+1,980 μL of 1× PBS) and mix gently by either pipetting or turning the tube upside down 25–30 times, ensuring the air bubble is moving up and down. Perform the next 100× dilution (10,000 in total) the same way, and the next 10× dilution (100,000 in total): 200 μL of the previous dilution and 1,800 μL of 1× PBS. Keep all intermediate dilutions at 4 °C. 2. Introduce the highest dilution into the sample chamber, using the pre-rinsed clean syringe as described before. Set up the microscope stage position and focus of the instrument. Visually inspect the number of particles per field of view in 7 plunger positions. If it is below 2 particles on average, proceed with a 5× lower dilution (higher particle concentration) prepared from kept intermediate dilutions. If the number of particles per field of view is around 10, record 5–6 videos, of 60 s each, with the following camera parameters in advanced mode: camera shutter: 850, camera gain: 450, lower threshold: 910, higher threshold: 10920. Process them with the following parameters in basic mode: detection threshold = 9 (Multi), MinExpectedParticleSize = 30 nm; all other parameters are kept in Automatic mode. In order to average the results over all repeated measurements, processing could be made in batch mode. Calculate the average particle concentration, corrected for the dilution used. Calculate the proper dilution to reach the optimal particle concentration of 1.5 × 10 8 particles/mL. 3. Discard all recorded videos, measurement results, and intermediate dilutions. The only result of this procedure is the proper dilution factor. 4. Rinse the syringe and the sample chamber once with 1× PBS to check their purity. Proceed with actual sample measurement using the estimated dilution. G. (Additional) Generation of stimulated antigen-presenting cells (APC) from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) Day 1: PBMC isolation 1. Collect 20–30 mL of peripheral blood in EDTA-coated tubes. Note: We recommend a minimum of 20 mL of peripheral blood to isolate PBMCs, as 10 million PBMCs are needed to start APC stimulation. For better performance, we recommend stimulating 30 million PBMCs. In general, 1–2 million PBMCs are isolated from 1 mL of peripheral blood. 2. Dilute the blood 1:1 with RT PBS (e.g., 20 mL of blood + 20 mL of PBS). 3. Layer diluted blood over 3 mL of RT Ficoll-Paque in a 15 mL tube. Add diluted blood dropwise to prevent mixing with Ficoll-Paque. 4. Centrifuge at 900× g for 45 min at 20 °C (with the brake turned off). 5. Carefully harvest the PBMC layer (the cloudy interface). 6. Transfer PBMCs to a new 50 mL tube, add 30 mL of PBS, and centrifuge at 300× g for 10 min at 20 °C. 7. Remove the supernatant. 8. Resuspend PBMCs in 5 mL of ACK lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min at RT. 9. Add 45 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 300× g for 10 min at 20 °C. 10. Repeat the wash step G9 once. 11. Resuspend PBMCs in 2 mL of prewarmed complete RPMI-1640. 12. Count cells with trypan blue. 13. Dilute cells to 2–3 × 10 6 cells/mL and transfer them to a T25 flask (10–15 × 10 6 cells/flask in 5 mL). 14. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 for 2–4 h to allow monocyte adhesion. 15. Gently aspirate the supernatant (which contains lymphocytes) and wash the adherent monocytes twice with warm PBS. 16. Add fresh complete RPMI-1640 containing 100 ng/mL GM-CSF and 50 ng/mL IL-4. 17. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 for 6 days. Days 3 and 5 Note: Stimulated cells may exhibit weak adhesion to the culture flask. During medium replacement, detached cells should be precipitated to reduce possible cell loss. 18. Aspirate 2.5 mL of supernatant from the T25 flask and centrifuge at 300× g for 10 min at 20 °C. 19. Remove the supernatant. 20. Resuspend cells in complete RPMI-1640 containing 100 ng/mL GM-CSF and 50 ng/mL IL-4. 21. Add the resuspended cells in fresh medium to the flask with the remaining cells. Day 7 22. Inspect the cells using a microscope. Upon successful differentiation, the DCs will become less regular in shape and develop thin, long processes ( Figure 5A ). Figure 5. Stimulation of antigen-presenting cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). (A) Representative light microscopy images of adherent monocytes from PBMCs before stimulation and following 7-day stimulation with IL-4 and GM-CSF. (B) Gating strategy and histograms illustrating the flow cytometry analysis of stimulated antigen-presenting cells (APC) stained with a-CD206-PE antibodies. For comparison, fresh non-stimulated PBMCs are shown in grey. 23. Transfer the culture medium from the flask into a sterile 15 mL tube. 24. Wash the cells 2–3 times with complete RPMI-1640, swirling the flask to dislodge debris. Transfer all wash medium to the same 15 mL tube to recover loosely adherent cells. 25. Add 900 mL of complete RPMI-1640 and use a sterile cell scraper to detach firmly adherent cells. 26. Pellet cells from the combined medium/wash solution by centrifugation at 300× g for 10 min. 27. Resuspend cells in 2–3 mL of complete RPMI-1640. 28. Count cells with trypan blue. Verify differentiation of CD206-positive cells by flow cytometry ( Figure 5B ) 29. Centrifuge 250,000 cells at 300× g for 10 min. 30. Resuspend the cell pellet in 50 μL of PBS 0.1% BSA with anti-CD206-PE (1:100 dilution) and incubate with the antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. 31. Add 500 μL of PBS 0.1% BSA and centrifuge at 300× g for 5 min to wash the cells. 32. Resuspend the cell pellet in 50 μL of PBS-0.1%. Acquire the data using a flow cytometer (e.g., ACEA NovoCyte 3000). A representative example of the APC subpopulation is provided in Figure 5B . H. (Additional) Analysis of the efficiency and specificity of the delivery by targeted EVs To ensure accurate assessment of protein cargo delivery into target cells, thoroughly wash cells after incubation with EVs. Residual EVs or free proteins adhering to the cell membrane via nonspecific interactions (electrostatic/hydrophobic forces) can contribute to background signal, confounding the interpretation of delivery specificity. To minimize adhesion artifacts: (i) use PBS-EDTA (2 mM) during washing to disrupt charge-based interactions, (ii) include BSA in buffers to block nonspecific binding, (iii) perform all washes at 4 °C to reduce active membrane remodeling, and (iv) include Proteinase K washing step. To analyze the efficiency and specificity of NanoLuc delivery to APC by targeted EVs: 1. Prepare a 5-fold dilution series of freshly isolated EV samples in PBS 0.1% BSA. 2. Prepare a 5-fold dilution series of recombinant NanoLuc in PBS 0.1% BSA. 3. Adjust EV concentrations to equal NanoLuc activity (RLU) across samples. 4. Dilute recombinant NanoLuc and EVs in PBS 0.1% BSA so that they give the same signal in RLU. 5. Add the same volume of EVs or recombinant NanoLuc to 1 × 10 6 of stimulated APCs in complete RPMI-1640 [e.g., 100 μL of EVs or NanoLuc solution to 0.5 mL of APCs (2 × 10 6 cells/mL)]. Note: Cell counts and volumes of EVs or NanoLuc solutions can be adjusted based on experimental requirements. However, to maintain cell viability and experimental consistency, we recommend adding EVs or NanoLuc solutions at ≤20% of the total medium volume. 6. Incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 for 2 h. Note: Incubation parameters (time, temperature, CO 2 levels) can be adjusted to align with experimental goals or cell type requirements. 7. To wash the cells, transfer them to a 1.5 mL tube and fill it with 1× PBS. Centrifuge the cells at 300× g for 10 min and discard the supernatant. Note: We recommend centrifuging cells using a swinging bucket rotor (rather than fixed-angle rotors) to minimize cell loss. Swinging buckets ensure uniform force distribution during pelleting, reducing the risk of dislodging loosely adherent cells or disrupting fragile pellets. 8. Resuspend cells in 200 μL of PBS + 50 μg/mL Proteinase K. 9. Rotate at 37 °C for 15 min to remove surface-bound EVs. 10. Fill a tube with PBS 0.1% BSA and centrifuge at 300× g for 10 min. 11. Repeat washing with PBS 0.1% BSA twice. 12. Count cells with trypan blue. 13. Centrifuge cells at 300× g for 10 min and resuspend the cell pellet in PBS 0.1% BSA with anti-CD206-PE (1:100 dilution). Use 100 μL of antibody solution for 1 × 10 6 cells. 14. Incubate with anti-CD206-PE for 30 min at 4 °C. 15. Centrifuge cells at 300× g for 10 min and resuspend in PBS 0.1% BSA. Filter cells through a cell strainer of 40 μm. 16. Sort CD206 + and CD206- populations using a Sony SH800 sorter. 17. Count cells with trypan blue. 18. Resuspend 10,000 sorted cells in 15 μL of PBS 0.1% BSA. 19. Measure luminescence with Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay (see Section E1) ( Figure 6 ). 20. Perform at least 3 replicates per biological sample. Figure 6. Specificity of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) to stimulated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from peripheral human blood. NanoLuc luciferase activity was measured in sorted CD206-positive and CD206-negative cell subpopulations to assess targeting efficiency. “Recombinant NanoLuc-Jun,” soluble protein control (normalized to EV luciferase signal prior incubation with cells); “trVSV-G,” EVs containing the truncated form of VSV-G; “trVSV-G - α-CD206,” EVs containing a truncated form of VSV-G fused with α-CD206 nanoantibody (clone 26.7 [21]). Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 4. *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, two-tailed Student’s t-test.\n\nValidation of protocol All experiments for EV characterization strictly adhered to the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) guidelines (latest version), ensuring compliance with standardized reporting criteria for EV identity, purity, and functionality. Specifically, we validated EV populations through (1) quantification of EV-enriched surface markers (CD63, CD81), (2) NTA for size distribution and concentration, and (3) TEM to confirm vesicle morphology. Reproducibility was rigorously demonstrated by performing all critical steps in biological triplicates, across independent experiments, with inter-assay variability quantified. This protocol was successfully applied in our peer-reviewed studies: • Ovchinnikova et al. [19]. Targeted macrophage mannose receptor (CD206)-specific protein delivery via engineered extracellular vesicles (Figures 2, 3, and 4). • Ovchinnikova et al. [18].

    "title": "An Integrated Workflow for Three-Dimensional Visualization of Human Skeletal Muscle Stem Cell Nuclei.",
    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle-specific stem cells are responsible for regenerating damaged muscle tissue following strenuous physical activity. These muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells (SCs), can activate, proliferate, and differentiate to form new skeletal muscle cells. SCs can be identified and visualized utilizing optical and electron microscopy techniques. However, studies identifying SCs using fluorescent imaging techniques vary significantly within their methodology and lack fundamental aspects of the guidelines for rigor and reproducibility that must be included within immunohistochemical studies. Therefore, a standardized method for identifying human skeletal muscle stem cells is warranted, which will improve the reproducibility of future studies investigating satellite activity. Additionally, although it has been suggested that SC shape can change after exercise, there are currently no methods for examining SC morphology. Thus, we present an integrated workflow for three-dimensional visualization of satellite cell nuclei, validated by the spatial context of the fluorescent labeling and multichannel signal overlap. Our protocol includes, from start to finish, post-biopsy extraction and embedding, tissue sectioning, immunofluorescence, imaging steps and acquisition, and three-dimensional data post-processing. Because of the depth volume generated from the confocal microscope z-stacks, this will allow future studies to investigate the morphology of SC nuclei and their activity, instead of traditionally observing them in two-dimensional space (x, y). Key features • Detailed instructions on post-biopsy extraction and embedding, tissue sectioning, immunofluorescence, imaging steps and acquisition, and three-dimensional data post-processing of muscle stem cells. • Builds upon the validated method developed by Feng et al. [1], which was optimized for mouse tissue and fills critical gaps in existing literature. • Allows qualitative and quantitative morphological assessment of muscle stem cell nuclei in three-dimensional space. Graphical overview Graphical overview of integrated workflow for three-dimensional visualization of human skeletal muscle stem cells. After the percutaneous muscle biopsy, cut ~25-100 mg of the sample and arrange it according to the desired orientation → Mount sample for sectioning, embed in mounting medium, and freeze in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane → Using a cryostat, generate tissue cross-sections in an alternating collection method of 20 μm intervals and place on subbed glass slides → Fix and block sections before incubating in a cocktail of primary antibodies specific for satellite cell nuclei (anti-Pax7) and muscle membrane (anti-laminin) overnight. The following day, incubate sections in the appropriate secondary antibodies (Pax7: goat anti-mouse IgG1 biotin conjugated; laminin: goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488), apply signal amplification using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and tyramide 594 conjugate before counterstaining with DAPI, add mounting media, and coverslip → Using a confocal microscope, search for Pax7 signal, confirm overlap with DAPI adjacent to laminin labeling, apply appropriate laser channels, determine z-stack size, and acquire images in high-pixel-resolution format → For image post-processing, in the software's three-dimensional viewer, modify individual channel histograms to optimize image quality and save as a TIFF.",

A. Muscle biopsy embedding protocol (see Figure 2 ) [13,14] Approximately 150–300 mg of skeletal muscle tissue is extracted from the vastus lateralis via the modified Bergstrom percutaneous muscle biopsy technique with suction [15,16]. Note: Perform steps A1–A4 20 min before biopsy. 1. Prepare a liquid nitrogen container (e.g., 5’’ circular Styrofoam cryo dewar). 2. Prepare the OCT embedding solution and mounting medium. a. In a 20 mL beaker, add ~100–150 μg of gum tragacanth and 3–4 small drops of water, mixing with a laboratory spatula. b. Add 1:1 OCT compound and mix to make a thick paste. 3. Prepare 2-methylbutane (isopentane): pour 10 mL of isopentane into a small (e.g., 125 mL) stainless-steel container. 4. Prepare cork mount: a. Cut a stopper cork (size zero) in half. With the bigger half, place a Swann-Morton scalpel through the center of the cork to make a platform for mounting media. Attach the bottom of the cork to a #11 scalpel. b. When tissue is ready to be mounted, layer and apply mounting medium, and then use fine tweezers to split mounting media in half to make room in the middle for the sample. 5. Following sample extraction from the inner trocar of the Bergström needle, place the muscle on a sterilized Petri dish, remove visible connective tissue (e.g., blood, fat, fascia) with a scalpel, and rinse with 1× PBS if the muscle is coated in excessive blood. 6. Using a sterile scalpel, cut approximately half the sample depending on the size and desired orientation; it is important to have intact fibers for immunohistochemistry (~0.5–0.75 cm in length and 25–100 mg of total tissue). 7. Place a stainless-steel container of isopentane into the Styrofoam container with liquid nitrogen and wait for the isopentane to begin crystallizing. 8. For processing and analyzing cross-sections, use a stereomicroscope with LED pipe lights and tweezers to examine the orientation of the muscle sample. 9. Use fine-tipped forceps and a spatula to carefully place the cut muscle sample (fibers running parallel) straight up (try to be precise) onto the cork like a cylinder. Using the spatula, gently work the mounting medium in to encapsulate the sample and close any gaps between the muscle and outside air. Note: If the muscle sample is exposed in a certain area to outside air, this will cause freeze-damage to the muscle tissue. 10. Apply a cover layer of OCT to further protect the tissue from any outside air. 11. Once the isopentane is ready, flip the sample upside down and immerse the cork so that the sample is fully submerged in the liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane until OCT hardens over the sample (i.e., ~30 s). Note: If the isopentane is ready, after a few seconds in liquid nitrogen, it should start solidifying, and white solids should form on the bottom of the stainless-steel container. 12. Detach the embedded tissue from the scalpel and place it in aluminum foil on a plastic Petri dish floating above liquid nitrogen for 60 min. This ensures non-rapid freezing and prevents freeze-fracture. After that, place it in an appropriate storage area until ready to section. The embedded tissue can be stored at -80 °C for long-term storage (2 years) or at -20 °C for short-term storage (6 months). Figure 2. Embedding process of muscle tissue. (A) Prepare a cork mount by cutting a stopper cork in half through the center of the cork to make a platform for mounting media; attach the bottom of the cork to a #11 scalpel. When the tissue is ready to be mounted, layer and apply mounting medium and then use fine tweezers to split the mounting media in half to make room in the middle for the sample. (B) Use fine-tipped forceps and a spatula to carefully place the cut muscle sample (fibers running parallel) straight up (try to be precise) onto the cork like a cylinder. Use the spatula to gently work the mounting medium in to encapsulate the sample to close any gaps between the muscle and outside air. (C) Apply a cover layer of OCT to further protect the tissue from any outside air. (D, E) Once the isopentane is ready (crystals forming at the bottom), flip the sample upside down and immerse the cork to where the sample is fully submerged in the liquid nitrogen–cooled isopentane until OCT hardens over the sample (i.e., ~30 s). Detach the embedded tissue from the scalpel and place it in aluminum foil on a plastic Petri dish floating above liquid nitrogen for 60 min. This ensures non-rapid freezing and prevents freeze-fracture. Afterward, place it in an appropriate storage area until ready to section. The embedded tissue can be stored at -80 °C for long-term (2 years) or at -20 °C for short-term storage (6 months). B. Sectioning protocol using cryostat 1. Set cryostat temperature to -23 °C and stage knife cutting angle to 4°. Note: Other lab protocols have recommended a cutting angle set between 8° and 10°. 2. Label the Superfrost slides by including subject/sample number, slide number, primary and secondary antibodies and stains (e.g., DAPI) applied, date of experiment, and initials of the investigator. 3. Once cooled, obtain the sample from the freezer or fridge and quickly transfer to the cryostat chamber, making sure the sample stays frozen. 4. Apply a layer of OCT to the chuck stub (i.e., specimen holder), place the sample flat and perpendicular to the knife into the OCT, and use a cold spray to quickly spray around where the new OCT was added to allow solidification. Note: Other lab protocols have recommended a 1 h incubation so that the mount acclimates to the temperature and prevents the cork from tearing off the chuck while sectioning. 5. Mount the chuck stub into the holder and align it to the knife stage so that the sample is perpendicular to the blade; input and orient the appropriate microtome blade. 6. Begin facing the block. Once the tissue is visualized in the block, section the sample in an alternating method of 20 μm intervals (i.e., collect→ trash → collect→ trash) and collect the cryo-sections on frosted, subbed Superfrost slides with approximately three tissue sections per slide. Make sure sections are centered away from the edges of the slide. Note: We recommend alternate sectioning to control for duplicate sampling. Also, if the goal is to quantify, this way you can ensure the analysis will not be of the same cell. If sections are not flattening correctly, remove the anti-roll plate and, with one hand, use a small camel hair paint brush (e.g., size 2) to pull the section as it is being cut while your other hand controls the microtome wheel. 7. Dry the sections at room temperature (RT) for 30 min and proceed immediately to the fixation and staining protocol. If using a PAP pen, circle samples to be stained. Note: Although drying the sections in the freezer overnight or for long-term storage at -80 °C or -20 °C for later use is acceptable, this increases background autofluorescence. For best results, use immediately. C. Immunofluorescence protocol (adopted and modified from Fry et al. [17]) For our example protocol, we label four Superfrost slides with three tissue sections on each slide. Slides 1 and 2 were labeled with Pax7 + laminin + DAPI stain, slide 3 was labeled with Pax7 + DAPI stain (external control for laminin), and slide 4 was labeled with laminin + DAPI stain (external control for Pax7). We recommend 75 μL of working buffer per tissue section to be fully covered on a subbed, flat glass slide. A PAP pen can be used to prevent the reagent from running off the tissue sections and keep them covered; however, we do not use a PAP pen. Other labs have used a Coplin jar for submerging sections; however, this requires significantly higher amounts of reagents and buffers. Day 1: 1. Place slides in a plastic humidity chamber with a moist paper towel that is soaked flat inside the reservoir to keep humid, so the buffer/reagents do not evaporate. Note: Using the humidity chamber for this protocol makes it very efficient to quickly remove and replace buffer/reagent (discard/dump into paper towel). 2. Fix tissue sections in ice-cold acetone for 3 min. a. Place aliquoted acetone on ice, pipette 75 μL (or appropriate volume) to each section for each slide, and quickly remove acetone after 3 min. Note: The longer the incubation in acetone, the higher the chance of autofluorescence. Additionally, methanol is not recommended as a fixative solution due to its high autofluorescence. However, we have previously used 2%–4% formaldehyde. 3. Using a pipette, wash tissue sections three times × 3 min with 1× PBS (aliquot the 1× PBS into a small beaker for the protocol to avoid contamination) to remove the fixative solution. 4. Block endogenous peroxidase. a. Add 75 μL (or appropriate volume) of 3% H 2 O 2 in 1× PBS for 7 min at RT. Note: Bubbles forming on the section indicate that the peroxide is working; a lack of bubbling will not affect the staining outcome but indicates poor tissue quality. 5. Using a pipette, wash tissue sections three times × 3 min with 1× PBS to remove the H 2 O 2 solution. 6. Total protein blocking: a. Add 75 μL (or appropriate volume) of 2.5% normal horse serum (i.e., blocking buffer) to each section and incubate for 60 min at RT. Note: We previously used 0.1%–0.2% Triton X-100 in this blocking step as a permeabilization agent and the results were suboptimal. Since no difference was observed, we opted to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane and use the blocking bluffer without any detergent. b. Begin preparing the primary antibodies: 2 slides/6 tissue sections of Pax7+laminin (cocktail); 1 slide/3 tissue sections of Pax7 only; 1 slide/3 tissue sections of laminin only. 7. Apply primary antibody: Add 75 μL (or appropriate volume) of the appropriate primary antibody to each section on slides 1–4. a. Slides 1 and 2: Prepare 500 μL (working volume; 6 tissue sections) of Pax7 (1:100) + laminin (1:200) cocktail diluted in 2.5% NHS. b. Slide 3: Prepare 300 μL (working volume; 3 tissue sections) of Pax7 (1:100) diluted in 2.5% NHS. c. Slide 4: Prepare 300 μL (working volume; 3 tissue sections) of laminin (1:200) diluted in 2.5% NHS. d. Slide 3 (Pax7 only) and slide 4 (laminin only) are used to determine the signal produced by background staining of the tissue. Thus, omitting the primary antibody should be included as a secondary control method. e. To ensure the specificity of the primary antibody against Pax7, negative and positive controls must be included. For negative control, we used the C2C12 myoblast cell line with sp2/0-ag14 serum added to inhibit Pax7 protein expression ( Figure 3 ). For positive control, we used the same C2C12 myoblast cell line with horse serum added to induce Pax7 protein expression ( Figure 4 ). Figure 3. Immunohistochemical negative control for validating the specificity of Pax7 labeling. The C2C12 (ATCC CRL-1772) mouse myoblast cell line incubated in sp2/0-ag14 conditioned serum media was used as a negative control for Pax7 identification. The sp2/0-ag14 serum replaced the traditional horse serum, which induces differentiation and expression of Pax7. This figure plate shows a very weak nonspecific background signal but not Pax7 positive labeling. C2C12 cells were thawed at passage 13 (P13) and cultured for 5 days in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + 1% penicillin-streptomycin + 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO 2 . Cells were then passaged and incubated in the same culture media but with sp2/0-ag14 conditioned sera for 3 days. The immunohistochemical protocol was run at cell passage 14 (P14) in an 8-well Ibidi μ-slide with a 200 μL working volume. Briefly, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min, blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 7 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, blocked in 3% normal goat serum diluted in 1× HBSS+0.1% sucrose+1.0% saponin for 20 min, and incubated overnight in a mouse monoclonal anti-Pax7 IgG1 primary antibody (dilution 1:100). The next day, cells were incubated in goat anti-mouse IgG1 biotin-SP-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000) for 60 min, incubated in streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 60 min, amplified with Alexa Fluor 594 tyramide conjugate (dilution 1:200) for 20 min, and counterstained with 10 mM DAPI for 30 min. VectaShield antifade mounting media was added, and plates were stored at 4°C until imaging. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX-81 epifluorescent inverted microscope with the Olympus UPlanSApo 40×/0.95 NA long-working-distance objective and SlideBook 6.0 software. Scale bar = 20 μm. Figure 4. Immunohistochemical positive control for validating the specificity of Pax7 labeling. The C2C12 (ATCC CRL-1772) mouse myoblast cell line incubated in differentiation media containing horse serum was used as a positive control for Pax7 identification. Horse serum induces differentiation and expression of Pax7 when applied for more than two days. This figure plate shows a strong overlapping signal with DAPI (merged image), indicating similar signal intensities in both the muscle tissue samples and C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells were thawed at passage 12 (P12) and cultured for two weeks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + 1% penicillin-streptomycin + 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO 2 . Cells were then passaged and incubated in differentiation culture media replacing FBS with horse serum for 3 days. The immunohistochemical protocol was run at cell passage 13 (P13) in an 8-well Ibidi μ-slide with a 200 μL working volume. Briefly, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min, blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 7 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, blocked in 3% normal goat serum diluted in 1× HBSS + 0.1% sucrose + 1.0% saponin for 20 min, and incubated overnight in a mouse monoclonal anti-Pax7 IgG1 primary antibody (dilution 1:100). The next day, cells were incubated in goat anti-mouse IgG1 biotin-SP-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000) for 60 min, incubated in streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 60 min, amplified with Alexa Fluor 594 tyramide conjugate (dilution 1:200) for 20 min, and counterstained with 10 mM DAPI for 30 min. VectaShield antifade mounting media was added, and plates were stored at 4°C until imaging. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX-81 epifluorescent inverted microscope with the Olympus UPlanSApo 40×/0.95 NA long-working-distance objective and SlideBook 6.0 software. Scale bar = 20 μm. f. Ensure the humidity chamber is damp and full of wet paper towels below the slides. Cover with the top of the humid chamber lid and carefully store at 4 °C overnight. Note: You can use parafilm to prevent air from entering the gap between the chamber and the lid. However, we had no problem with the primary antibodies evaporating by the next day. Day 2: 8. The next day, using a pipette, wash tissue sections on the slides four times × 5 min in 1× PBS. 9. Apply Pax7 secondary antibody to slides 1–3 (keep out of direct light from here on). a. Add 75 μL (or appropriate volume) of secondary antibody specific to Pax7 (goat anti-mouse IgG1 biotin conjugated; 1:1,000 diluted in 2.5% NHS) and incubate for 1 h at RT in the dark (cover with aluminum foil). Note: Prior to preparing the dilution, quickly centrifuge the secondary antibody and take the solution from the top. b. Leave slide 4 in 1× PBS. 10. Using a pipette, wash tissue sections four times × 5 min in 1× PBS. 11. Apply laminin secondary antibody to slides 1, 2, and 4. a. Add 75 μL (or an appropriate volume) of secondary antibody cocktail specific for laminin (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; 1:200) and streptavidin-HRP (1:100) diluted in 1× PBS and incubate for 1 h at RT in the dark (cover with aluminum foil). Note: In this case, streptavidin-HRP will be used to bind with tyramide conjugate in the next step to amplify the signal of Pax7. b. Leave slide 3 in 1× PBS. 12. Using a pipette, wash tissue sections three times × 5 min in 1× PBS. 13. Apply tyramide conjugate signal amplification. Note: Different protocols have been tested without tyramide conjugate (i.e., no amplification), but the labeling of satellite cells is suboptimal and not consistent. Specifically, there is low signal-to-noise from Pax7 labeling, sometimes there is no overlap between DAPI and Pax7 signals, and there is random nonspecific binding scattered all over the section. a. Add 75 μL (i.e., or appropriate volume) of Alexa Fluor 594 tyramide conjugate (1:200; diluted in 1× PBS) and incubate for 20 min at RT in the dark (cover with aluminum foil). 14. Using a pipette, wash tissue sections three times × 5 min in 1× PBS. 15. Apply DAPI counterstain. a. Add 75 μL (or appropriate volume) of 10 mM DAPI and incubate for 30 min at RT. If short on time, it is acceptable to incubate in DAPI overnight. If there is overnight incubation, wash the tissue sections five times × 5 min in 1× PBS the next day. 16. Using a pipette, wash tissue sections three times × 5 min in 1× PBS. 17. Mounting: a. Using a 20–200 μL pipette, cut off the bottom end of a 200 μL pipette tip to allow the suction of the viscous mounting media and prevent air bubbles. b. Place 3–4 droplets (20–50 μL/slide) of the Vectashield antifade mounting media and carefully cover the slides with wide (22 × 50) coverslips, allowing the mounting medium to spread throughout the slide for 1–2 min. Note: Be very careful not to get any air bubbles covered over your sections and make sure the mounting media spreads similarly throughout your sections—not too much or too little. c. Carefully seal with nail polish by gently dabbing around the edges of the entire coverslip without moving it. d. Store in a slide holder at 4°C in the dark until imaging. The sooner the image acquisition, the better. However, fluorescent labeling will last for several weeks if slides are stored properly (i.e., slides lying flat at 4 °C, in the dark). D. Confocal imaging acquisition This protocol is intended for SC visualization with a confocal microscope. Images were obtained on a Leica TCS SPE laser scanning confocal DM6-Q upright microscope equipped with four laser lines (405, 488, 561, and 635 nm) and an 8-bit spectral PMT detector with the Leica ACS APO 40×/1.15 NA oil objective and LAS X software version 3.5.7.23225. Z-stack images were acquired with a 0.44 μm step size for a total of 19.49 μm z-stack size (length), at 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution, 400 μs/pixel laser scan speed, and pinhole at 1 AU. Captured images were 275 × 275 μm in image size, 268.82 × 268.82 nm in pixel size, and 1.0 zoom factor. Additional instructions are as follows: Note: An epifluorescent (widefield) microscope can be utilized; however, this will sacrifice greater resolution and image quality. If using an epifluorescent microscope, the sample thickness should be sectioned thinner (i.e., 5–10 μm). 1. Turn on the laser, microscope controller (i.e., if automated), and white light source. 2. Open the instrument software and load the slide. 3. Once the slide is loaded, move to a low-magnification objective (e.g., 10×/20×), change the port on the microscope from the computer to the objective lens, and adjust the z-position to focus your sample. 4. To best find and visualize the SCs within the sections, switch on the Texas red (TXR) 594 channel and search for a fluorescent signal on the focused section. Note: The channel used to probe for Pax7 will depend on the secondary antibody excitation/emission range. Alexa Fluor 594 excitation/emission range is 591/617 nm, which best corresponds to TXR 594. 5. Once you find a small (i.e., 3–10 μm) oval/circular area of fluorescent signal, switch channels to DAPI channel (405 nm laser excitation) to visually confirm overlap between DAPI (nucleus) and TXR signal. Note: There will sometimes be tiny patches of high signal noise. Therefore, it is crucial to switch channels to DAPI to confirm signal overlapping. You can also switch to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) channel (488 nm excitation) to visually confirm the spatial context of the TXR signal; the TXR fluorescent signal should be completely adjacent to the GFP (i.e., laminin) signal. 6. Once in position, change the low-magnification objective to a higher magnification (e.g., 40× or 63×) and/or proceed to the next step. Note: A higher magnification objective may require immersion oil. These objective lenses specifically require Type F immersion liquid (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany, catalog number: 11513859). If using an oil immersion objective, it is important to keep your sections on the slide toward the middle so that the cover glass does not scrape the objective. 7. On the software interface (see Video 1 ), add three sequential channels to set your filters: DAPI (405; for myonuclei), GFP or FITC (488; for Laminin), and TXR red (561; for SC nuclei) a. For myonuclei stain (DAPI), set the percentage of laser intensity and the gain (voltage) of the PMT to obtain at least 60% of the relative fluorescent intensity from the histogram, assign a pseudo-color (e.g., blue) to this signal, select the emission for DAPI, and set emission range to 430–480 nm. b. For laminin (GFP or FITC), set the percentage of laser intensity and the gain (voltage) of the PMT, select Alexa Fluor 488 emission (i.e., or appropriate secondary antibody used), assign a pseudo-color (e.g., green) to the signal, and set emission range to 500–540 nm. c. For Pax7 (TXR red), set the percentage of laser intensity and the gain (voltage) of the PMT, select Alexa Fluor 594 emission (i.e., or appropriate secondary antibody used), assign a pseudo-color (e.g., red) to the signal, and set emission range to 600–640 nm. Note: Modify the excitation intensity, gain, and emission range histogram for channels depending on how much contrast is displayed in the image preview. In our experience, we have had to modify these aspects depending on the different reagents utilized and section thickness. For example, if the brightness is too extreme (saturated), reduce the laser intensity first and then the gain depending on the fluorescence intensity shown in the histogram. Video 1. Setting up channels in the LAS X software operating the Leica SPE laser scanning confocal microscope 8. Select a low-pixel-resolution format (e.g., 512 × 512) and live mode to select the region of interest. 9. Determine the z-stack size (see Video 2 ) by focusing up/down and selecting the range from the sample depth. Carefully adjust the z-position of the objective to where there is no longer any signal in the one direction (e.g., objective further away from the sample) and click set/start position on the computer. Then, move the z-position toward the opposite direction (e.g., objective closer toward the samples) to where there is no longer any signal, and click the end position on the software to acquire the total volume. Video 2. Setting the z-stack in the LAS X software operating the Leica SPE laser scanning confocal microscope 10. Change pixel resolution format to 1,024 × 1,024 and begin/click image acquisition. a. While executing, record the z-stack size, z-step size, laser scan speed, zoom factor, image size, pixel size, optical section, and pinhole size. Note: For confirmation purposes, all SCs should be adjacent to the laminin signal and overlapping Pax7 and DAPI signals in the center of the nuclei. E. Image post-processing using 3D Viewer software (LAS X) 1. Once the image is acquired, observe the image using 3D viewer. 2. Change the background to black and select overlay under the Volume tab. 3. Begin modifying the histogram range (“...” icon) under the Volume tab of each channel (DAPI, Pax7, and laminin) to optimize image resolution and contrast. Take note of each image’s channel histogram ranges. Note: Each image should have a similar range (e.g., low: 3; high: 250), although the range values will differ depending on what objective was used. Typically, place the values on the histogram hugging just outside the bulk of the signal so that details of the image are not lost. Gamma must remain at 1.0. 4. Set the intensity to 100 and modify as needed depending on the brightness of the raw image. However, intensity values should also be similar across images. 5. Using the left (rotation) and right (x, y movement) clicker and rubber wheel (zoom) of the computer mouse, move through the image to the desired location and collect zoom percentage information. 6. Set scale bar. Note: We set the scale bar to Times New Roman, font size 26. This is optional, but you can add a frame or axis scaling to visualize the image. 7. Once image quality is optimized, click save image as and save as TIFF with a standard or custom frame size (e.g. 1,024 × 1,024). Note: The instructions above are for 3D visualization of the channels combined (overlay). In 3D viewer, you can also separate the channels into individual quadrants with one quadrant as an overlay if you wish to visualize the channels separately.\n\nValidation of protocol Following the detailed workflow above, SC nuclei can be visualized in a three-dimensional view to observe morphological characteristics ( Figure 4 ) and later perform downstream quantification analyses. Figure 5 was generated from a 27-year-old, well-trained male subject days after an intense lower body strength training session. Validation of these results is based on 10 replicates, all showing the spatial context of the fluorescent labeling (i.e., satellite cell nuclei on the border of the muscle fiber immunolabeled using laminin) and multichannel signal overlap of Pax7 and DAPI in three-dimensional volume. Figure 5. Representative three-dimensional (3D) images in rotating sequence, identifying human satellite cell nuclei (arrows) from vastus lateralis skeletal muscle tissue immunolabeled with a monoclonal anti-Pax7 primary antibody. Z-stack images showing satellite cell nuclei through Pax7 + (red; white arrows) labeling overlapped with DAPI (blue) along the membrane of the muscle fiber via laminin labeling (green). Red fluorescent signal was excited at 561 nm with 40% laser power intensity and 700 V PMT gain; green fluorescent signal was excited at 488 nm with 8% laser power intensity and 700 V PMT gain; blue fluorescent signal was excited at 405 nm with 6% laser power intensity and 700 V PMT gain. Fluorescence emission ranges for red, green, and blue were 600–640 nm, 505–540 nm, and 430–480 nm, respectively. Image post-processing was carried out using the Leica LAS X 3D Viewer software, where brightness intensity was set to 200, and channel signal histograms (minimum-maximum) were set for better display as 10–65, 5–165, and 20–250 for Pax7, laminin, and DAPI, respectively.

When the tissue is ready to be mounted, layer and apply mounting medium and then use fine tweezers to split the mounting media in half to make room in the middle for the sample. (B) Use fine-tipped forceps and a spatula to carefully place the cut muscle sample (fibers running parallel) straight up (try to be precise) onto the cork like a cylinder. Use the spatula to gently work the mounting medium in to encapsulate the sample to close any gaps between the muscle and outside air. (C) Apply a cover layer of OCT to further protect the tissue from any outside air. (D, E) Once the isopentane is ready (crystals forming at the bottom), flip the sample upside down and immerse the cork to where the sample is fully submerged in the liquid nitrogen–cooled isopentane until OCT hardens over the sample (i.e., ~30 s). Detach the embedded tissue from the scalpel and place it in aluminum foil on a plastic Petri dish floating above liquid nitrogen for 60 min. This ensures non-rapid freezing and prevents freeze-fracture. Afterward, place it in an appropriate storage area until ready to section. The embedded tissue can be stored at -80 °C for long-term (2 years) or at -20 °C for short-term storage (6 months).",

    "title": "Visualizing infection by single positive-sense RNA viruses using virus infection real-time imaging (VIRIM).",
    "abstract": "To understand viral infection and virus-host interactions, real-time, single-cell assays to track viral infection progression are essential. Many conventional assays sample large numbers of cells for single measurements, averaging out the cell-to-cell heterogeneity that is intrinsic to viral infection. Moreover, conventional assays often require cell fixation or lysis, limiting analysis to a single timepoint and masking the temporal and spatial dynamics of infection. We have developed virus infection real-time imaging (VIRIM), a method to visualize the translation of individual RNAs of viruses in real-time. The single-molecule and live-cell nature of VIRIM allows the examination of the earliest events of viral infection, when viral protein and RNA levels are still low, and allows study into the origins and consequences of cell-to-cell heterogeneity during virus infection. Here we provide a step-by-step description of the VIRIM assay, including a detailed procedure for designing, producing and validating the viruses required for VIRIM. In addition, we provide guidelines for generating the reporter cell line, performing the time-lapse imaging and analyzing the fluorescence microscopy data. Once established, a typical VIRIM experiment requires 2-5 days to complete.",
    "methods": "Methods Cell lines HeLa, HEK293T and BHK-T7 cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% PenStrep (GIBCO). HeLa MDA5 and MAVS k.o. cell lines were previously established 56 , 57 . Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Cell lines used in this study were routinely tested for presence of mycoplasma. Chemicals The following inhibitors were used in this study: dipyridamole (DiP, 25 μM, Sigma-Aldrich), MRT67307 (MRT, 1 μM, Sigma-Aldrich), Tofacitinib (TOFA, 1 μM, Sigma-Aldrich). All inhibitors were added to cells 30 min before virus addition. Virus design and production 5xSunTag-EMCV was produced as described previously 37 . Briefly, a 5xSunTag array was introduced in the infectious pM16.1 complementary (c)DNA clone of the Mengovirus strain of EMCV (kindly provided by A. Palmenberg) 58 . The array was introduced after codon 6 of the Leader protein and was followed by a 3C(D) cleavage sequence (VFETQG) to allow release from the viral polyprotein and prevent the SunTag array from interfering with viral protein functions. For GFP11-5xSunTag-EMCV, the GFP11 coding sequence was inserted upstream of the 5xSunTag array using Gibson assembly with an annealed oligo pair. No additional cleavage sequence was introduced between the GFP11 and 5xSunTag sequence. To enable infectious RNA production in T7-expressing BHK cells, a T7 terminator sequence was introduced downstream of the viral polyA sequence using Gibson assembly with annealed oligos. Virus stocks were generated by either transfecting purified in vitro transcribed viral RNA (HiScribe, NEB) or transfecting the infectious cDNA clone containing plasmid in BHK-T7 cells. The day after transfection medium was refreshed and 2–4 d after transfection, when a substantial cytopathic effect was observed, remaining cells and the supernatant were collected and subjected to 3 cycles of freezing–thawing. Cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation and supernatants were collected. Virus titres were determined by endpoint titration and viral RNA was extracted from particles to verify the insert sequence by RT–PCR and Sanger sequencing. Cell culture and infection for live imaging One day before imaging, cells were seeded on a 96-well glass-bottom plate (Matriplates, Brooks) such that cells were at ~80% confluency at the start of imaging. Medium was replaced with Leibovitz’s L15 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% PenStrep 30 min before the start of imaging. An MOI of ~1 was used for all imaging experiments, except when explicitly stated otherwise. Reporter cell line generation (Lentiviral) transduction GFP-STAb, PCP-mCherry-NLS and GFP(1–10)-P2A-PuroR were introduced into cells using lentiviral infection. For this, pHR-based lentiviral plasmids containing these transgenes were transfected into HEK293T cells together with pMD2G and psPAX2 helper plasmids using Fugene (Promega). After 2 d, viral supernatant was passaged over a 0.45 μm filter to remove cellular debris and polybrene (2 μg ml −1 , Santa Cruz) was added before transferring the virus-containing supernatant to recipient HeLa cells. At 2 d after virus transfer, medium was replaced and after two passages, single cells from the polyclonal cell population were sorted in 96-well plates by FACS. Cells with GFP-STAb expression were selected to have a similar GFP intensity as a previously established U2OS-GFP-STAb monoclonal cell line that is routinely used for translation imaging in our lab 59 . Cells with PCP-mCherry-NLS expression were sorted for low mCherry fluorescence. GFP(1–10)-P2A-PuroR transduced cells were treated with puromycin (1 μg ml −1 , Thermo Fisher) 3 d before sorting. After expansion, correct monoclonal cell lines were selected on the basis of expression levels of the transgenes. To generate a doxycycline-inducible, CMV-promoter-driven, 24xPBS transcription reporter, PCP-mCherry-NLS-expressing HeLa cells were infected with lentiviral particles to express TetR-2A-HygroR. At 2 d after infection, cells were selected for hygromycin resistance using 200 μg ml −1 hygromycin (Invivogen). A pcDNA3-based plasmid containing the CMV-TetOn-24xPBS transcription reporter was transfected into the TetR-expressing HeLa cells using Fugene according to manufacturer instructions. At 2 d after transfection, medium was replaced and cells with stable integration of the plasmid were selected using zeocin for 2 weeks (0.4 mg ml −1 , Invitrogen). Surviving cells were then sorted as single cells in 96-well plates and expanded to generate monoclonal cell lines. Individual clones were screened using doxycycline stimulation (1 μg ml −1 , Sigma-Aldrich): appropriate clones were selected that had no PP7 transcription site (TS) before doxycycline addition and which presented a transcription site in the nucleus after doxycycline addition. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to introduce the 24xPBS transcription reporter and BFP sequence into the IFIT1 and IRF3 locus, respectively. In addition to the 24xPBS, for selection purposes, a SNAP-tag and puromycin resistance cassette was included in the knock-in cassette (Extended Data Fig. 3a ). The dsDNA donor template for homology-dependent repair was created by excision of the donor sequence from a plasmid using Sap1 restriction enzyme. The ends of the donor sequence contained 300 bp homology to the genomic sequence of the IFIT1 and IRF3 loci. The 24 PBS hairpins in the reporter were re-designed to remove stop codons from the coding sequence and a P2A-PuroR-P2A-SNAP-tag-P2A cassette was added to the reporter in frame with the downstream IFIT1 coding sequence. Guide RNA (gRNA) sequences were ligated in a Cas9 plasmid (PX459) that was linearized with Bbs1 and from which the puromycin resistance gene was removed. The following guide sequences were used: IFIT1 5′-TGATTTAGAAAACAGAGTC-3′, IRF3 5′-CATGGATTTCCAGGGCCCTG-3′. The Cas9-guide construct was transfected together with linearized donor template and 2 d after, transfection medium was replaced. For the 24xPBS IFIT1 k.i., cells were then stimulated with 100 U ml −1 recombinant IFNα2 (Sigma-Aldrich) to induce transcription from the IFIT1 loci, resulting in expression of the puromycin resistance gene, which was integrated into the IFIT1 locus along with the PBS array. After 24 h, cells were continuously cultured in the presence of puromycin while receiving fresh IFN-containing medium once every 2 d. Surviving cells were expanded and sorted as single cells in 96-well plates to generate monoclonal cell lines. Genomic DNA of expanded clones was extracted using proteinase K digestion and correct integration of the 24xPBS reporter was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the edited allele. We determined that the second untagged IFIT1 allele in this cell line is transcribed but does not encode a functional protein because of a frameshifting insertion directly downstream of the translation start site (Extended Data Fig. 3b ). For the IRF3-BFP cells, no selection was performed before single-cell sorting by FACS. Monoclones were expanded and screened for BFP expression under the microscope. Correct integration of the BFP sequence was confirmed by PCR amplification of the edited locus and sequencing. Validation of 24xPBS IFIT1 knock-in reporter cell line To validate that expression of the PP7-tagged IFIT1 allele accurately reports on IFIT1 expression, we performed dual labelling smFISH with one set of probes targeting the tagged IFIT1 allele specifically and a second set (complimentary to the IFIT1 coding sequence) targeting mRNAs originating from both the PP7-tagged and untagged IFIT1 alleles (Extended Data Fig. 3c ). Using this method, we find that the reporter cell line has a single integration site of the 24xPBS reporter sequence because most cells showed only a single transcription site (Extended Data Fig. 3d ) (cells in which two 24xPBS reporter transcription sites were detected were likely to be in G2 phase of the cell cycle). Moreover, the transcription site labelled by the reporter-sequence-specific probes co-localized with IFIT1 -specific probes, indicating that the PBS array had integrated into the IFIT1 locus (Extended Data Fig. 3c ). To determine whether the tagged allele was expressed similarly as the untagged allele, we compared the number of mRNAs expressed from both alleles upon viral infection. We find a strong correlation between the expression levels of untagged IFIT1 mRNA and PP7-tagged IFIT1 mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 3e ), demonstrating that tagging of the IFIT1 allele does not alter its expression. We tested whether live-cell analysis of the PP7-tagged IFIT1 allele accurately reported on IFIT1 transcription. For this, we combined live-cell imaging of IFIT1 transcription with subsequent smFISH of the same cells. We find a strong correlation between cells showing IFIT1 transcription in live-cell imaging and cells showing IFIT1 expression by smFISH (Extended Data Fig. 3f ). Finally, we tested whether all cells with the 24xPBS IFIT1 k.i. could activate transcription of the reporter allele. Confirming this, we find that upon IFN stimulation (1,000 U ml −1 ), the vast majority of cells (~95%) develop a detectable IFIT1 transcription site (Extended Data Fig. 3g ). Together, these results show that the 24xPBS IFIT1 locus allows sensitive and accurate live-cell measurements of IFIT1 transcription and can therefore be used as a real-time readout to monitor innate immune activation in single cells. smFISH smFISH was performed according to protocols described previously 60 , 61 . smFISH probe generation Stellaris probe designer ( https://www.biosearchtech.com/support/tools/design-software/stellaris-probe-designer ) was used to design probes targeting IFIT1 , IFNB1 , MAVS , TBK1 , MX2 and Puro-P2A-SNAP (part of the 24xPBS transcription reporter) mRNA or EMCV vRNA. All probe sets contained 48 target sequences except for IFNB1 (31 probes) and Puro-P2A-SNAP (36 probes). 20-mer oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies and pooled (sequences are listed in Supplementary Data Table 1 ). All oligonucleotide probes targeting a single RNA were combined and labelled with ddUTP-coupled Atto488, Atto-565 or Atto-633 dyes (AttoTec) using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase as described previously 61 . Fluorescent probes were purified by ethanol precipitation, washed to remove unlabelled probes and resuspended in nuclease-free water. Concentration of labelled probes and labelling efficiency were determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy. smFISH staining procedure Cells on 96-well glass-bottom plates were washed in PBS0 and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 5 min at r.t. After fixation, cells were washed 3 times in PBS0 and permeabilized in 100% ethanol for 30 min on ice, followed by two 15 min washes in wash buffer (2xSSC, 10% formamide in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) at r.t. Labelled smFISH probes were diluted to 10 nM in hybridization buffer (1% dextran sulfate, 2xSSC, 10% formamide in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) and hybridization was performed in a sealed dark container at 37 °C for 16 h. Unbound smFISH probes were removed by two 1 h washes in wash buffer at 37 °C and a 15 min wash at r.t. Samples were stored and imaged in imaging buffer (10 mM Tris pH8, 2xSCC, 0.4% glucose, supplemented with glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) and catalase (Sigma-Aldrich)). Imaging was performed within 3 d after probe hybridization. smFISH staining in combination with dsRNA immunofluorescence To combine smFISH staining with immunofluorescence (IF) against dsRNA, the smFISH procedure was followed until the first wash step after probe hybridization. Samples were incubated for 30 min in IF block buffer (PBS0 + 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich)) at r.t. Monoclonal anti-dsRNA antibody (J2, Jena Bioscience) diluted at 1:1,000 (from a 1 µg µl −1 stock solution) in IF block buffer was added to the samples and incubated for 45 min at r.t. After this, cells were washed 3 times with IF block buffer and incubated in IF block buffer containing 1:500 donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam) for 45 min at r.t. Finally, cells were washed once in IF block buffer, once in smFISH was buffer and samples were stored in smFISH imaging buffer. Growth curve and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) HeLa cells expressing GFP-STAb were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in flat-bottom 96-well plates. Cells were infected on the next day for 30 min with 5xST-EMCV(L Zn ) at MOI = 5. Medium was refreshed at indicated timepoints post infection and plates were either freeze–thawed 3 times to lyse the cells for titration or lysed using RNA lysis buffer for isolation of total RNA for RT-qPCR. Supernatants were titrated with endpoint titration assays to determine viral titres. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the amount of viral RNA copies and expression of IFIT1 and IFNB1 at different timepoints post infection. For this, total RNA was isolated using Nucleospin RNA kits (Machery-Nagel). Subsequently, reverse transcription was performed on the isolated RNA using random hexamer primers and Taq Man reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was subjected to RT-qPCR, with specific primers for IFIT1 , IFNB1 , EMCV vRNA and Actin (sequences are listed in Supplementary Data Table 1 ). Relative levels of IFIT1 and IFNB1 mRNA and EMCV vRNA were normalized to Actin expression. Results are the average of three biological replicates. In each experiment, expression was determined from three technical replicates. Of note, whereas IFIT1 induction was first detected at 8–10 h.p.i. by RT-qPCR, it was only detected 7 h after the start of phase 3 by smFISH (Fig. 2d ). On average, infections require 6 h to complete phase 2 after addition of virus (Extended Data Fig. 2a ) and the induction as observed by smFISH would thus appear to occur considerably later than as detected by RT-qPCR. However, a subset of infections rapidly completes the initial replication (<2.5 h) and the moment of antiviral gene induction as detected by RT-qPCR probably reflects activation of IFIT1 expression in a fraction of these cells. Microscopy All fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon TI2 inverted microscope equipped with a Yokagawa CSU-X1 spinning disc and a Prime 95B sCMOS camera (Photometrics). Imaging was performed using a ×60/1.40 NA oil objective. Image acquisition was performed using NIS Elements software and making use of the ‘perfect focus system’ to correct for Z drift during time-lapse imaging experiments. The microscope was equipped with a temperature-controlled incubator and imaging was performed at 37 °C for live-cell experiments or at r.t. for smFISH samples. Microscopy acquisition settings For smFISH samples that were not previously subjected to live-cell imaging, a random position in the centre of the well was selected and a large field of view was constructed by imaging 4 × 4 neighbouring imaging fields. Approximately 15 Z -slices at 0.5 μm interval that covered the entire cell were acquired for IFIT1 , IFNB1 , MAVS , TBK1 , MX2 and Puro-P2A-SNAP smFISH labelled cells and a single Z -slice at the centre of the cell was acquired for EMCV FISH labelling. smFISH samples were imaged with a 50 ms exposure time (except EMCV FISH for which 70 ms exposure was used). For live-cell imaging experiments that were not followed by smFISH, random non-overlapping positions were selected. Movies with live-cell reporters were acquired with a 5 min time interval between frames, except for the BFP channel in experiments involving the IRF3-BFP cell line; because of the high laser power required to obtain sufficient BFP signal, we limited the imaging interval to 1 frame per 30 or 60 min to reduce phototoxicity (initial experiments were performed at 1 frame per 60 min to minimize phototoxicity; in later experiments, 1 frame per 30 min was found to be equally well-tolerated by cells). Typically, 10 Z -slices at 0.8 μm interval were acquired for GFP and mCherry channels, whereas a single Z -slice was acquired for the BFP channel in experiments involving the IRF3-BFP cell line. Signal in the red channel (561 nm laser), used for imaging of IFIT1 transcription, was acquired using a 50 ms exposure time; signal in the green channel (488 nm laser), used for VIRIM and split-GFP imaging, was acquired with an exposure time of 70 ms; signal in the blue channel (405 nm laser), used to visualize IRF3-BFP localization, was acquired using a 50 ms exposure time. For live-cell imaging experiments that were followed by smFISH, positions were selected for live imaging in a pattern that could be retrieved. For this, a series of consecutive field-of-views was selected starting from the edge of the imaging well. Images were taken at a 10 min interval. After completion of the live-imaging experiment, the imaging plate was gently removed from the microscope stage and cells were immediately washed and fixed. After completion of smFISH (and IF) staining protocol, positions were retrieved by navigating to the first field of view at the edge of the imaging well and imaged again to visualize smFISH labelling. For imaging of dsRNA IF staining, a stack of fifteen 0.5 µm slices was acquired using a 70 ms exposure time. Post-acquisition data processing Maximal intensity projections for all Z -slices were generated using NIS Elements software and all downstream analyses were performed on these projections. In experiments involving intensity measurements (split-GFP signal accumulation, IFIT1 transcription and IRF3-BFP nuclear translocation), analysed channels were corrected for photobleaching using the ‘bleach correction’ plugin in ImageJ. Data analysis smFISH analysis To calculate the fraction of infected cells that was positive for antiviral gene expression, the number of infected cells was first determined on the basis of the EMCV FISH signal. However, only if a cell had >50 EMCV smFISH spots was it considered infected because at 16 h.p.i., considerable release of viral particles from infected cells resulted in substantial smFISH signal originating from virus particles on the outside of a cell. Beyond ~8 h.p.i., the amount of viral genomes in infected cells was frequently too high to count individual vRNAs. These cells were also scored as EMCV positive. In the experiment with dipyridamole treatment (Fig. 1e ), no cells with >50 vRNAs could be detected and instead, all cells in the large image were evaluated for IFIT1 and IFNB1 expression (again, viral particles on the outside of the cell precluded accurate quantification of the number of vRNAs in the cell by smFISH). The number of IFIT1 and/or IFNB1 mRNA spots was determined for each infected cell. To determine the number of nascent RNAs (Extended Data Fig. 1f ), only the spots overlapping with the nuclear marker BFP-NLS were determined. The number of spots was determined using the ‘Spot Counter’ plugin in ImageJ. Detection settings were optimized for each measurement, due to experimental variation in smFISH labelling, and manually curated for each measurement. For IFIT1 , IFNB1 , MAVS , TBK1 , MX2 and Puro-P2A-SNAP smFISH, spots that were unusually bright (>2.5-fold mean intensity of single spots) and non-spherical were not scored as individual mRNAs, as such foci probably originated from dye aggregates. Transcription sites identification based on smFISH signal (Extended Data Fig. 3d ) was defined as any spherical foci, localized in the nucleus, with a high spot intensity (>2.5-old mean intensity of single spots). At ~200 spots per cell, considerable overlap in spots in the maximum intensity projection impaired accurate spot detection, hence 200 spots per cell was set as an upper limit for quantification. On the basis of the number of smFISH spots in uninfected cells, we set a stringent cut-off value of 20 IFIT1 , 10 IFNB1 and 5 MX2 mRNAs, above which a cell was considered positive for expression of each gene. If cells were partially outside the field of view or if cells were blurred at an image stitch during large-image construction, they were not included in the analysis. Viral load and dsRNA IF intensity measurement Viral load was determined using the cytosolic fluorescence intensity of EMCV-Atto488 FISH staining. The mean intensities of 10–20 regions of interest (ROIs) (20 × 20 pixels) that were randomly positioned in the cytoplasm without overlap were determined and the average of the measurements was calculated. The number of ROI measurements was chosen so that >80% of the cell’s cytoplasm was ultimately part of an intensity measurement. For each repeat, an average cellular background signal intensity was derived from uninfected cells and subtracted from average cellular EMCV signal intensities. To compare viral loads between different experiments, these values were normalized to the average intensity of the 10 cells with the highest signal in the experiment and this normalized value was multiplied by 1,000. Note that Fig. 2e first shows a notable increase in viral load only at 4 h, even though the smFISH-based approach has single-genome detection sensitivity. This apparent absence of signal is due to our quantification method: because individual vRNAs cannot be resolved at late infection timepoints, we quantified viral load using total FISH staining intensity rather than smFISH spot count. Since the fluorescence signal of a single vRNA contributed very little to total cellular fluorescence, an increase in viral load was only observed when large numbers of vRNAs were present in the cell. To quantify dsRNA IF staining intensity, average cellular signal intensity was determined. The average signal derived from uninfected cells was subtracted from each intensity, yielding a background-subtracted intensity. These values were normalized per experiment similar to how viral load was normalized (that is, to the average of the 10 cells with the highest signal). smFISH spot intensity To determine the distribution of IFIT1 and IFNB1 smFISH spot intensities, the intensity of all spots (max. 30 per cell) in a random region of a IFIT1/IFNB1+ cell was determined. For this, a 4 × 4 pixel ROI centred around the middle of a spot was used to measure the mean fluorescence intensity. Mean intensity of an adjacent 4 × 4 pixel ROI without spot was determined and subtracted from the spot intensity. Non-spherical/overlapping spots and putative transcription sites were excluded from the analysis. Background-subtracted spot intensities were normalized to the average spot intensity in the cell. VIRIM quantification Annotation of viral infection phases based on SunTag spots in VIRIM was performed as described previously 37 . In brief, GFP spots were considered viral translation sites on the basis of their size, mobility and intensity. For example, when cells expressed both GFP-STAb and GFP(1–10), a fraction of cells presented with large cytosolic GFP spots that are not viral translation sites (they are present in uninfected cells as well). However, these spots can be readily discriminated from viral translation sites on the basis of their larger size and slower mobility. The start of VIRIM phase 3 was defined as the moment when one or more viral translation site(s), as visualized by SunTag labelling, re-appear after being absent during VIRIM phase 2 (initial replication phase). Because of the imaging interval of 5 or 10 min and the relatively short duration of phase 3 (~30 min), a steep increase in the number of SunTag spots between frames was typically observed during VIRIM phase 3. This steep increase in the number of SunTag spots was used to pinpoint the start of phase 3 in those cells in which accurate calling of VIRIM phase 1 (and 2) was challenging. In experiments involving infections at MOI = 5, multiple translating incoming vRNAs precluded accurate assignment of VIRIM phases 1 and 2. Nevertheless, the typical ‘bursty’ increase of multiple newly translating vRNAs that mark the start of VIRIM phase 3 can still be observed. Therefore, in MOI = 5 experiments, the start of phase 3 was determined by the first timepoint of a timepoints series during which a steep increase in the number of translating vRNAs was observed. The start of VIRIM phase 1 was defined as the first timepoint of a series of at least 4 timepoints in which a single translation site was visible in 3 or more timepoints. In Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 2g , infections were classified as ‘abortive infection’ if (1) the start of VIRIM phase 1 occurred in the first 8 h after addition of virus and (2) no VIRIM phase 3 was observed in the remainder of the movie, that is, in the remaining ~8 h. VIRIM in combination with smFISH Various parameters were determined from the VIRIM live imaging and smFISH staining. Start of VIRIM phase 3, number of IFIT1 and IFNB1 spots and EMCV viral load were determined as described above. Only cells for which complete VIRIM history and successful smFISH staining were available were analysed. Cells for which time-lapse imaging data could not be faithfully linked to smFISH data (for instance, because of high cell density) were excluded from analysis. Cells that underwent mitosis were excluded from the analysis if mitosis took place just before the start of VIRIM phase 3 (<30 min after completion of cytokinesis) or if mitosis occurred between the start of phase 3 and the end of the movie. For EMCV(L WT )-infected cells, only positions in which an IFIT1+ cell was present were analysed. Transcription site intensity measurements Identification of 24xPBS IFIT1 transcription sites during live imaging was based on the following criteria: (1) An IFIT1 TS is a spherical (diffraction limited) spot and considerably smaller in size compared with typical nucleoli (which are also enriched in mCherry signal; see for instance, Fig. 3a ). An IFIT1 TS fits within a 5 × 5 pixel ROI. (2) IFIT1 TSs show slow and highly confined diffusion within the nucleus. (3) An IFIT1 TS emerges during the course of infection, that is, they are absent at the start of infection and not present in uninfected cells. (4) The mCherry fluorescence intensity of an IFIT1 TS fluctuates over time, in contrast to mCherry signal originating from nucleoli and aggregates. (5) An IFIT TS is present for a prolonged period (>60 min, in a minimum of 6 frames). The timepoint of the first appearance of an mCherry spot that meets these criteria was considered as the onset of IFIT1 transcription. Multinucleated cells or cells that formed syncytia during the movie were excluded from analysis. The intensity of IFIT1 TSs was determined by measuring the mean intensity of a 5 × 5 pixel ROI positioned over the centre of the TS and subtracting the mean intensity of an ROI of the same size positioned directly adjacent to the TS from this value. If a TS overlaps (partially) with a nucleolus, then background subtraction was performed by measuring the intensity of an ROI in the direct vicinity of the TS that has a comparable fraction of nucleolar overlap. From the intensity time trace, the area under the curve (AUC) was determined using the trapezoidal rule, where the average intensity value between consecutive timepoints was determined and multiplied by the time interval. These values were summed to determine the AUC of an IFIT1 TS intensity time trace. Cells with AUC > 5,000 a.u. were considered positive for IFIT1 transcription. To quantify IFIT1 transcriptional activity at the onset of transcription, the average IFIT1 TS intensity in the first hour after the appearance of an IFIT1 TS was determined. If a TS was temporarily absent during this 1 h time period, an intensity value of zero was included in the average calculation. Intensity of the 24xPBS CMV TS was determined in a similar fashion to IFIT1 TS intensity measurements. Compared to IFIT1 , CMV TS identification differed in one aspect: CMV TSs are present at the start of the movie and remain present throughout the movie. To be included in the analysis, at least 66% of the frames must have a detectable CMV TS. Average CMV intensity traces were smoothened by applying a moving average with a window size of 5 timepoints. Split-GFP intensity measurements While both the VIRIM and split-GFP systems have their readouts in the GFP channel, both can be accurately assessed simultaneously in the same cell because early in infection, the signal originating from the split-GFP is low, allowing readout of the VIRIM signal (that is, GFP foci), while later in infection (~3 h after the start of phase 3), the signal originating from the split-GFP system becomes strong enough to detect over the ‘background’ GFP signal originating from GFP-STAb (Fig. 3b,c ). To measure split-GFP reconstitution, the mean cytosolic GFP intensity was measured at every timepoint. For this, a 25 × 25 pixel ROI was positioned in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 non-overlapping positions and the average was calculated. If fluorescent aggregates were present in the cell (see also ‘VIRIM quantification’), these were avoided. To subtract baseline GFP signal originating from the GFP-STAb, the average cytosolic GFP intensity in the first 2 h of the movie was subtracted from all values. In some cases, morphological changes to the cell occurred during the movie that strongly affected GFP intensity measurements, for example, during cell death or detachment at the end of infection. In such cases, measurements after the morphological changes occurred were excluded from further analysis. Automated split-GFP measurement and cluster analysis Nuclear segmentation was performed on the basis of the nuclear signal of PCP-mCherry-NLS using cellpose 62 . The mean GFP pixel intensity for each nuclear mask at each timepoint was computed. Single cells were tracked over time using the btrack algorithm 63 . Segmentation and tracking results were displayed in napari and the performance of the algorithms was manually curated for a subset of positions. A track length of at least 40 timepoints was chosen as a quality threshold, resulting in a total number of 1,430 tracks from 3 independent experiments. Single-cell split-GFP tracks were smoothed by applying a moving average with a window size of 10 timepoints. The smoothed single-cell traces were then clustered using the dynamic time warping algorithm from the dtw R package 64 . The resulting distance matrix was used for hierarchical clustering using average linkage and split into eight clusters. This resulted in three main clusters corresponding to the non-infected traces (flat-shaped curve, n = 440) and two sigmoidal curve shapes, differing in their growth rate and plateau height (split-GFP low/medium n = 842, split-GFP high n = 129). Importantly, the dynamic time warping algorithm clusters split-GFP intensity time traces on the basis of trace similarity independent of when infection is initiated. This allows inclusion of infections that started at different moments during the live-cell imaging. IRF3-BFP nuclear translocation To determine the intensity ratio of nuclear/cytosolic IRF3-BFP, BFP signal intensity was measured in the nucleus and cytosol in the same manner as cytosolic split-GFP signal intensity (that is, the average of 3 mean intensity measurements using a 25 × 25 pixel ROI was determined; see section ‘Split-GFP intensity measurements’). Background correction was performed by subtracting the mean intensity of a 25 × 25 pixel ROI positioned at a cell-free area. The nucleocytosolic IRF3-BFP ratio was determined for every timepoint and time traces were aligned to the start of IFIT1 transcription (or start of phase 3 in the case of Fig. 5c ). Ratio time traces were normalized to the average nucleocytosolic ratio between 2 to 7 h before the start of IFIT1 transcription (or start of phase 3). To quantify the translocation efficiency, the AUC of the nucleocytosolic ratio time traces before normalization was determined using the trapezoidal rule starting from 6 h after the start of phase 3 until the end of the movie (this timepoint was chosen because at 6 h after the start of phase 3, the first infected cells displayed IRF3-BFP nuclear translocation). The AUC was divided by the number of frames that were included in the AUC calculation to correct for different trace durations. IRF3-BFP nuclear translocation was defined using the following requirements: (1) An increase in the nucleocytosolic ratio was observed in multiple, consecutive frames (spanning >30 min, in a minimum of 3 frames). (2) During at least two frames, the increase in the nucleocytosolic ratio was at least 0.1 unit. The moment of translocation was defined as the first timepoint of a series of frames that fulfilled these requirements. If no IRF3-BFP nuclear translocation was observed according to these criteria, cells were not included in the analysis to determine the timing difference between the moment of translocation and the start of IFIT1 transcription (Fig. 5d ). Statistical analysis Unless stated otherwise, statistical tests were performed using a P value of 0.05 as a cut-off for significance and assuming normal distribution of experimentally determined averages. Normality was not assumed when comparing endogenous expression levels of MAVS , TBK1 and IRF3 in IFIT1− and IFIT1+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 1g–i ) and when comparing the maximum slopes of split-GFP intensity time traces (Extended Data Fig. 4b ). In these instances, Mann–Whitney tests were performed to assess statistical significance of distribution differences. All P values were calculated using two-tailed tests. The type of test and the type of error bars used in figures are indicated in the figure legends. An overview of the number of experimental repeats and the total number of observations per condition are listed in Supplementary Data Table 2 . Genotyping results presented in Extended Data Fig. 3b show representative results of two repeat experiments. To extract descriptive parameters from the split-GFP intensity time traces (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b,f ), a logistic growth curve was fitted on the (average) split-GFP traces using the following general equation: 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$f\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{A}{1+B {e}^{\\left(-C t\\right)}}$$\\end{document} f x = A 1 + B e − C t where f (x) describes the split-GFP intensity as a function of time ( t ), A represents the plateau value, B is a baseline-derived constant and C is the logistic growth rate.

(Linear) regression analysis was performed in GraphPad PRISM. To quantify the extent of correlation in Fig. 1g and Extended Data Figs. 1f , 2f and 5c , the Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( r ) was determined. In Extended Data Fig. 3e , linear regression was performed excluding observations where the number of mRNAs was above the detection limit (>200 mRNAs). The 95% confidence interval of the linear fit and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) were determined to assess the quality of the linear regression. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nsmFISH staining procedure Cells on 96-well glass-bottom plates were washed in PBS0 and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 5 min at r.t. After fixation, cells were washed 3 times in PBS0 and permeabilized in 100% ethanol for 30 min on ice, followed by two 15 min washes in wash buffer (2xSSC, 10% formamide in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) at r.t. Labelled smFISH probes were diluted to 10 nM in hybridization buffer (1% dextran sulfate, 2xSSC, 10% formamide in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) and hybridization was performed in a sealed dark container at 37 °C for 16 h. Unbound smFISH probes were removed by two 1 h washes in wash buffer at 37 °C and a 15 min wash at r.t. Samples were stored and imaged in imaging buffer (10 mM Tris pH8, 2xSCC, 0.4% glucose, supplemented with glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) and catalase (Sigma-Aldrich)). Imaging was performed within 3 d after probe hybridization.\n\nSupplementary information Reporting Summary Supplementary Video 1 Movie of live-cell virus imaging using VIRIM combined with smFISH for IFIT1 , IFNB1 and EMCV. HeLa cells expressing GFP-STAb were infected with 5xSunTag-EMCV(L Zn ) and imaged for 16 h. Then, cells were fixed and smFISH staining was performed for IFNB1 mRNA (magenta), IFIT1 mRNA (cyan) and positive strand EMCV vRNA (EMCV(+), white). For the VIRIM imaging, a maximal intensity projection of 9 Z -slices was generated. Time is indicated in h:min since the start of image acquisition. Images of the smFISH staining were projected on top of the last frame of the VIRIM imaging. Supplementary Video 2 Movie of live-cell virus imaging using VIRIM and split-GFP in combination with IFIT1 transcription imaging. 24xPBS IFIT1 cells expressing GFP-STAb, GFP(1–10) and PCP-mCherry-NLS were infected with GFP11-5xSunTag-EMCV(L Zn ) and imaged for 16 h. Left panel (green) shows VIRIM and split-GFP signal, middle panel (magenta) shows IFIT1 transcription signal (first appearance of IFIT1 TS at 11h10) and the right panel shows the merge of both imaging channels. For both channels, 9 Z -slices were acquired and processed to generate a maximal intensity projection. In the GFP channel, large immobile foci can be observed which probably represent aggregates of GFP-STAb and GFP1–10 (see Methods ). Time is indicated in h:min since the start of image acquisition. Images from this movie are also shown in the example images in Fig. 3a. Supplementary Video 3 Movie of live-cell imaging of IFIT1 transcription and IRF3-BFP nuclear translocation. IRF3-BFP and 24xPBS IFIT1 cells stably expressing GFP-STAb and PCP-mCherry-NLS were infected with 5xSunTag-EMCV(L Zn ) and imaged for 16 h. Left panel (in grey) shows IFIT1 transcription signal (first appearance of IFIT1 TS at 13h00) and the right panel (displayed using the ‘inferno’ lookup table) shows the IRF3-BFP signal. For the IFIT1 transcription imaging, 9 Z -slices were acquired every 10 min and processed to generate a maximal intensity projection. For IRF3-BFP, a single Z -slice was acquired every 60 min.

    "title": "Quantification of Proliferating and Mitotically Active Retinal Cells in Mice by Flow Cytometry.",
    "abstract": "Adult mammals lack the ability to regenerate retinal neurons after injury. However, in previous studies from this lab, topical application of the selective alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, PNU-282987, has been associated with an increase in the number of retinal neurons in adult murine models both in the presence and absence of injury to the retina. Additionally, studies assaying mitotic markers have shown a substantial increase in the amount of mitotically active and proliferating cells with the topical application of the alpha7 nAChR agonist. However, these previous studies were performed using fluorescent immunolabeling and subsequent confocal microscopy, thus limiting the number of antibodies that can be multiplexed. As a result, we have developed a flow cytometry method that allows for the multiplexing and analysis of multiple external and internal markers in dissociated retinal cells. In this paper, a step-by-step protocol is described for the labeling of multiple retinal cell types such as retinal ganglion cells, rod photoreceptors, and Müller glia, concurrently with Müller glia-derived progenitor cells that arise after treatment with PNU-282987. Key features • Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian retina. • Flow cytometry of retinal cells. • PNU-282987-induced mitotic activity in the retina. • Dissociation of the retina for flow cytometry analysis. Graphical overview Schematic demonstrating the protocol for preparation of retinal cells for flow cytometry analysis. (A) Adult mice (3-6 months) are subjected to topical PBS eyedrop treatment containing DMSO (control groups) or PNU-282987 (experimental groups). Both eyedrop treatments contain 1 mg/mL of BrdU to label proliferating cells. After treatment, mice are euthanized, and retinae are harvested for dissociation using papain. (B) Dissociated retina cells are fixed and permeabilized before aliquots are taken for cell counts on a hemocytometer. After determining the number of cells present, conjugated antibodies and unconjugated primary antibodies are added at the appropriate dilutions. Fluorescent secondary antibodies are added for markers that are unconjugated. Cells are then subjected to flow cytometric analysis using a BD LSRFortessa.",

Laboratory supplies 10 mm Petri dish (VWR, catalog number: 10799-192) 90 mm Petri dish (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: P10903 ) General lab supplies (pipettes, tips, tubes, etc.) 5 mL Falcon round-bottom Polystyrene test tubes with 70 μm cell strainer (Fisher, catalog number: 08-771-23)\n\nProcedure Eyedrop application Treat adult mice (3–6 month old) with eyedrops containing either 1% DMSO and 1 mg/mL BrdU or 1 mM PNU-282987 and 1 mg/mL BrdU for 28 days. Detailed instructions on how to apply eyedrops can be found in Linn et al. [11]. Briefly, the mouse is immobilized by scuffing the skin over their neck. One drop of DMSO/BrdU or DMSO/PNU-282987/BrdU eyedrop solution is placed on the bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye using a transfer pipette positioned upward by twisting the restrainer’s hand. The drop should cover the entire eye and should sit on the top of the eye for 1–2 s. Next, the restrainer twists their hand so that the left eye is positioned upward. A drop of DMSO/BrdU or DMSO/PNU-282987/BrdU eyedrop solution is placed on the bulbar conjunctiva of the left eye and allowed to sit for 1–2 s. Retina harvesting After euthanasia by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, place Dumont #7 curved forceps around the posterior aspect of the eyeball near the optic nerve. Apply gentle pressure and lift the eyeball out of the cavity. Place in a 10 mm Petri dish filled with 3 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS ( Figure 1A ). Grasping the sclera with Dumont #5 forceps, move the eye out of the Petri dish. Create a puncture hole using a scalpel along the corneal equator ( Figure 1B and 1C ). Hold the edge of the puncture hole with Dumont #5 forceps and place the eye back into the Petri dish. Insert Spring scissors into the puncture hole to create a circumferential incision along the corneal equator ( Figure 1D ). Using a second pair of Dumont #5 forceps, begin to peel away the cornea and the iris from the posterior eye cup. Grasping the optic nerve with Dumont #5 forceps to generate traction may be necessary at this step ( Figure 1E and 1F ). Once the cornea and iris are peeled away, the lens will be fully revealed. Remove the lens from the posterior eye cup with Dumont #5 forceps ( Figure 1G ). Evert the posterior eyecup with Dumont #5 forceps to prolapse the retina ( Figure 1H ). Holding the sclera with Dumont #5 forceps, remove the retina from the posterior eye cup with Spring scissors ( Figure 1I ). Remove any remaining, black-pigmented retinal epithelium with Spring scissors. Rinse the isolated retina by submerging it in a new 10 mm Petri dish filled with 3 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS ( Figure 1J ). Figure 1. Illustration demonstrating retina dissection. (A) Submerge the enucleated mouse eye in ice-cold 1× PBS in a 10 mm Petri dish. (B) Using Dumont #5 forceps, grasp the sclera and move the eye outside of Petri dish. While securing the eye in place with Dumont #5 forceps, create a scleral puncture using a scalpel along the corneal equator. (C) The black rectangle surrounded by the dotted circle depicts where the puncture wound should be placed. (D) Using Dumont #5 forceps, grasp the edge of the puncture wound to place the eye back into the dish. Insert Spring scissors into the puncture wound and create a circumferential incision along the corneal equator. (E) Using a second pair of Dumont #5 forceps, start peeling away the cornea and the iris from the posterior eye cup. (F) Grasp the optic nerve to generate traction. (G) Remove the lens while grasping the posterior eyecup with Dumont #5 forceps. (H) Prolapse the retina by everting the posterior eyecup with Dumont #5 forceps. (I) Secure the posterior eyecup in place with Dumont #5 forceps. Detach the retina from the posterior eyecup with Spring scissors. If any black pigmented retinal pigment epithelium remains, gently remove it with Spring scissors. (J) View depicting the isolated retina after dissection. After dissection, the isolated retina should be rinsed by submerging it in a new Petri dish filled with ice-cold 1× PBS. Retina dissociation Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing papain, DNase I, and ovomucoid inhibitor to yield the proper concentrations. Transfer the four retinae using Dumont #5 forceps into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube filled with 500 μL of papain that has been warmed to 37 for at least 10 min in a water bath. Mince the retinae into eight pieces using Spring scissors. Add 25 μL of 1 mg/mL DNase I to papain. Close the microcentrifuge tube lid and place it in an incubator heated to 37 on a rocker for constant agitation for 60 min. Note: Optimal papain incubation time was determined in a separate experiment to investigate which incubation time yielded the highest number of living cells (Figure S1). Pour the solution into a 90 mm Petri dish. Use warm EBSS to rinse out any remaining retinal tissue. Triturate the tissue with a 10 mL pipette at least five times or until the solution appears cloudy and there are no large pieces of retinal tissue remaining. Transfer contents to a 15 mL conical tube. Caution: The introduction of bubbles during trituration should be avoided. Bubbles have a high surface tension that can cause lysis. Centrifuge at 300× g for 5 min. While contents are centrifuging, create a resuspension solution in a 15 mL conical tube containing 2.7 mL of EBSS, 300 μL of ovomucoid inhibitor solution, and 150 μL of DNase I. Remove the supernatant. Using a 10 mL pipette, transfer the entire resuspension solution created in step C9 to the conical tube containing the cell pellet and resuspend the cell pellet by triturating it 1–2 times. Prepare discontinuous density gradient. In a new 15 mL conical tube, transfer 5 mL of ovomucoid inhibitor solution prepared in step C1 using a 10 mL pipette. Next, using a 10 mL pipette, add the entirety of the cell suspension created in step C10 on top of the 5 mL of albumin-ovomucoid solution to create a two-phase solution. Caution: It is important to avoid mixing the two-phase solution. We have found that the best way to avoid mixing is to tilt the Pipet-Aid containing the cell suspension horizontally and release the liquid on the “slow” setting. Centrifuge at 70× g for 6 min. Note: A flow cytometry plot depicting a freshly dissociated retina is represented in Figure 2 . Figure 2. Unfixed and unpermeabilized dissociated retinae. (A) Plot depicting unfixed and unpermeabilized dissociated retinae with no fluorescent antibodies added. (B) Parameters include FSC (forward scatter; size) and SSC (side scatter; granularity). The corresponding voltages were implemented to detect an optimal signal above the noise and resolve positive and negative populations. Fixation and permeabilization Discard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet by triturating it 3–5 times in 2 mL of 4% PFA using a 10 mL pipette. Let this sit for 15 min at room temperature for fixation. Centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min. Discard supernatant in hazardous waste and wash cell pellet by resuspension, triturating it 1–2 times in 2 mL of FACS buffer. Centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet by triturating it 3–5 times in 2 mL of 0.1 M HCl that has been prewarmed to 37 using a 10 mL pipette. Incubate at 37 in a warmer for 15 min. Centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet by triturating it 3–5 times in 2 mL of 0.4% Triton-X 100 using a 10 mL pipette. Let this sit for 15 min at room temperature for permeabilization. Note: A flow cytometry plot depicting a fixed and permeabilized retina is represented in Figure 3 . Figure 3. Fixed and permeabilized dissociated retinae. (A) Plot depicting fixed and permeabilized dissociated retinae with no fluorescent antibodies added. The light-scatter properties of cells that have been fixed and permeabilized are typically altered, as evidenced by comparing Figure 2 and Figure 3. However, after excluding debris with gating, the two plots are comparable. (B) Parameters include FSC (forward scatter; identifies size), SSC (side scatter; identifies granularity), APC-eFluor-780 (Thy1.2), Alexa-405 (rhodopsin), BUV 395 (vimentin), PerCP-eFluor-710 (BrdU), and BUV 737 (Ki67). The corresponding voltages were implemented to detect an optimal signal above the noise and resolve positive and negative populations. While incubating, collect 20 μL of the suspension and count cells using an automated cell counter or manually using a hemocytometer. Note: Cell counts are approximately 1 × 10 6 per two retinas. Centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant. Add 20 μL of Fc block and 50 μL of BD Horizon Brillant Stain Buffer to all experimental tubes. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Add 2 mL of FACS buffer using a 10 mL pipette and centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of FACS buffer by triturating it 1–2 times using a 1 mL glass pipette. Remove suspension from 15 mL conical using a 1 mL glass pipette and add it to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The following groups should be created: A) single-stain compensation beads for each color in separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes ( Table 2 ); B) untreated/unstained cells ( Table 3 ); C) DMSO control ( Table 3 ); and D) PNU-282987 treated ( Table 3 ). Our panel included the following controls: A) compensation beads + BUV-395 only, compensation beads + APC-Efluor-780 only, compensation beads + Alexa-405 only, compensation beads + PerCP-Efluor-710 only, compensation beads + BUV-737 only; B) untreated/unstained cells; and the following experimental groups: C) DMSO control cells with Vimentin_Strep-BUV-395; Thy1.2_APC-eFluor-780; Rho_Alexa-405; BrdU_PerCP-eFluor-710; Ki67_BUV-737; and D) PNU-282987-treated cells with Vimentin_Strep-BUV-395; Thy1.2_APC-eFluor-780; Rho_Alexa-405; BrdU_PerCP-eFluor-710; Ki67_BUV-737. Notes: Compensation controls are necessary to set instrument voltages and compensate samples. Compensation controls must be repeated for every experiment. In the case of the retina, we found beads are the most appropriate material for compensation as compared to retina cells. Please note that FMOs are utilized to determine positive vs. negative gates for the fluorophores included in the panel. FMOs need to be run during panel setup. An example of the FMO panels used in this experiment can be found in Figure S2. Table 2.

Centrifuge at 150× g for 5 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet by triturating it 1–2 times in 500 μL of FACS buffer using a p1000 pipette. Transfer the sample into a 5 mL Falcon round-bottom polystyrene test tube by passing it through the 70 μm cell strainer. Vimentin Add the appropriate amount of antibody (see Table 1 ) that is used to label Müller glia using vimentin to the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the cell pellet resuspended in 1 mL of FACS buffer.

Remove supernatant and resuspend cells by triturating it 1–2 times in 1 mL of FACS buffer using a p1000 pipette. After briefly vortexing the streptavidin BUV-395, add it to the cell suspension at a concentration of 2 µL per 1 × 10 6 cells. Allow this to sit for 30 min at room temperature. Centrifuge at 150× g for 5 min. Remove supernatant and triturate the cell pellet 1–2 times in 500 μL of FACS buffer using a p1000 pipette Transfer the sample into a 5 mL Falcon round-bottom polystyrene test tube by passing it through the 70 μm cell strainer. Rhodopsin Prepare the rhodopsin antibody solution by combining 5 μL of mouse α Rhodopsin IgG, 5 μL of Zenon TM mouse IgG labeling reagent (Component A), and ≤ 20 μL of 1× PBS in a separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Incubate in the dark for 5 min at room temperature. Add 5 μL of Zenon TM blocking reagent (Component B) to the antibody solution. Incubate in the dark for 5 min at room temperature. Add the appropriate amount of antibody (see Table 1 ) that is used to label Müller glia using vimentin to the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the cell pellet resuspended in 1 mL of FACS buffer.

Quantitative results are shown in Figure 5 . Figure 4. Representative gating strategy used for gating vimentin+ and Ki67+ cells after 28 days of DMSO and PNU-282987 treatment. (A) and (F) A gate is made around the main cell population to exclude debris (SSC-A vs. FSC-A). (B–C) and (G–H) Singlet gates are drawn using FSC-H vs. FSC-A and SSC-H vs. SSC-A. (D) and (I) Vimentin+ cells are gated using FMOs to determine the cell population positive for vimentin (FSC-A vs. BUV-395-A). Back-gating figure for vimentin, displaying vimentin+ cells in the parent populations, is depicted in Figure S3. (E) and (J) Vimentin+ cells that are also labeled for the proliferation marker Ki67 are gated around. FMOs were utilized to determine positive cell populations (BUV-737-A vs. BUV-395-A). Figure 5. Müller glia and proliferating Müller glia are increased in PNU-282987-treated samples. Adult (3–6 month old) mice were treated with 1× PBS eyedrops containing 1% DMSO and 1 mg/mL BrdU or 1 mM PNU-282987 and 1 mg/mL BrdU for 28 days. Subsequently, retinae were dissociated and processed for analysis by flow cytometry. (A) Graph showing the percent increase of vimentin+ Müller glia cells in DMSO vs. PNU-282987-treated samples.

    "title": "Labeling Postsynaptic Densities for Super-Resolution Microscopy With Minimal Signal-Loss and Offset.",
    "abstract": "Accurate labeling of excitatory postsynaptic sites remains a major challenge for high-resolution imaging due to the dense and sterically restricted environment of the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here, we present a protocol utilizing Sylites, 3 kDa synthetic peptide probes that bind with nanomolar affinity to key postsynaptic markers, PSD-95 and Gephyrin. eSylites (excitatory Sylites) specifically target the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of PSD-95, enabling precise and efficient labeling of excitatory postsynaptic density (ePSD). In contrast, iSylites (inhibitory Sylites) bind to the dimerizing E-domain of the Gephyrin C-terminus, allowing selective visualization of inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD). Their small size reduces linkage error and enhances accessibility compared to conventional antibodies, enabling clear separation of PSD-95 nanodomains in super-resolution microscopy. The protocol is compatible with co-labeling using standard antibodies and integrates seamlessly into multichannel immunocytochemistry workflows for primary neurons and brain tissue. This method enables robust, reproducible labeling of excitatory synapses with enhanced spatial resolution and can be readily adapted for expansion microscopy or live-cell applications. Key features • Protocol for using synthetic bidendate peptide probes: eSylites [1] for PSD-95 at excitatory synapses and iSylites [2] for Gephyrin at inhibitory synapses. • Compatible with standard antibody staining for multiplexed imaging of primary neurons and tissue sections. • Reduces linkage error, improving spatial resolution and nanodomain visualization in super-resolution microscopy.",

Parafilm 14. 150 mm Petri dish (Celltreat Scientific, catalog number: 229656)\n\nProcedure A. Preparation of dissociated hippocampal neurons on coverslips Note: All procedures involving animals followed the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the US National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committees at the University of California, Davis. If you wish to prepare the primary neuronal cultures that are part of this protocol, ensure that you have all institutional permissions from the appropriate authorities for the use of the respective laboratory animals. 1. One day prior to P0–P1 mouse dissection, prepare coated coverslips by putting 18 mm #1.5 coverslips in individual wells of a 12-well plate. 2. Add 270 μL of PDL solution on top of the coverslips. Ensure that the solution forms a stable meniscus on top of the coverslip without spilling over to the bottom of the well, as shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Poly-D-lysine (PDL) coating on coverslips. Limiting PDL to the coverslip surface restricts cells to the coverslip during seeding, preventing them from spreading to the bottom of the plate. 3. Incubate the 12-well plate overnight at 4 °C. 4. Prepare culturing medium in a 50 mL T25 flask with a vented cap or in a 50 mL conical tube with the cap loosely closed. Incubate in a CO 2 incubator overnight at 37 °C. 5. Before dissection, rinse the coverslips three times with ultrapure water and allow them to air-dry inside the biosafety cabinet with the lid removed. Air drying usually takes approximately 1 h and is normally completed by the time the dissection steps are finished. 6. Decapitate E18 or P0–P1 pups at the base of the skull, then stabilize the head by inserting a pair of thin straight forceps into the eye sockets ( Video 1 ). 7. Cut the skin along the sagittal suture from the posterior to the anterior side with 3.5 mm Castroviejo micro scissors. 8. Cut the skull along the sagittal suture from the posterior to the anterior side and along the bone plate below the ears on both sides. 9. Carefully scoop out the brain by using a freer elevator or a spatula and immerse it in precooled HBSS solution without calcium and magnesium in a 60 mm Petri dish. 10. Slice off the cortex from the midbrain by using a scalpel. Video 1. Isolation of cerebral hemispheres from P0–P1 mouse neonates 11. Using a dissection microscope, carefully peel off the meninges with ultrafine forceps ( Video 2 ). 12. Orient the hemisphere with the dorsal side of the brain facing upward. The hippocampi should be clearly visible. 13. Remove the hippocampi from the cortex by using forceps. For detailed procedures and pictures, see [12]. Video 2. Isolation of hippocampi from cerebral hemispheres 14. Transfer the isolated hippocampi into a 5 mL conical tube containing fresh HBSS without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ solution and keep on ice while dissecting the remaining animals (two pups are sufficient to prepare one 12-well plate). 15. Remove the HBSS solution and rinse with prewarmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution twice. 16. Incubate the tissue in 5 mL of fresh, prewarmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution at 37 °C for 15 min, gently flipping the tube midway through the incubation. 17. Remove the trypsin-EDTA solution, then quench any residual enzymatic activity by washing the tissue three times with HBSS containing calcium and magnesium. 18. Replace the solution with 1 mL of pre-equilibrated culture medium. 19. Carefully triturate the tissue using a 1 mL pipette tip trimmed to different pore sizes: 11 times with a large-pore tip, 11 times with a medium-pore tip, and 11 times with an uncut tip. 20. Allow the undissociated tissue chunks to settle by gravity for 1 min. 21. Take out the supernatant and perform a cell count using a hemocytometer with a 5–10-fold dilution. 22. Dilute cell suspension to a final density of 360,000 cells/mL with pre-equilibrated culture medium. 23. Add 250 μL of the suspended cells on top of the pre-coated coverslip. The solution should form a stable meniscus on top of the coverslip without spilling over to the bottom of the well. 24. Incubate the cells in a CO 2 incubator for at least 2 h for the cells to adhere onto the coverslip. 25. Add 750 μL of culture medium to make up the volume to 1 mL. 26. Incubate the cell in a CO 2 incubator for at least 14 days and refresh 40% of the culture medium every 7 days. B. Neuron fixation 1. Fix the neurons at the desired days in vitro (DIV) by first removing the culture medium and rinsing twice with PBS, followed by a 15-min incubation with either 4% PFA or glyoxal solution. Ensure that cells do not dry out during solution changes. While glyoxal fixation may offer improved image quality, no significant difference in labeling efficiency has been observed between PFA and glyoxal. 2. Remove fixation solution and gently wash the cells with PBS for 5 min on an orbital shaker, repeating the wash three times. Pause point: Fixed neurons can be stored at 4 °C after fixation for up to 2 weeks. Critical: Sylite labeling is sensitive toward the choice of fixation reagent. eSylite labeling is sensitive to the integrity of the PDZ binding pockets. Cells stored for more than one month may exhibit collapsed binding pockets, resulting in a loss of eSylite signal, while PSD-95 antibody staining may still be detectable. Caution: Glyoxal and PFA are environmentally hazardous. Quench excess aldehydes by incubating with 1 M glycine for 15 min before discarding the solution down the drain. C. Sylite labeling 1. Block and permeabilize the cells using a blocking/permeabilization solution (see Recipe 5) for at least 30 min at room temperature. Cells can be kept in the blocking/permeabilization solution for 1–2 days at 4 °C. Note: For extracellular labeling, perform blocking and permeabilization separately, omitting Triton X-100 during the blocking step. Fish serum or 3% BSA in PBS can be used as the blocking reagent. Blocking is not necessary when using Sylites alone and is primarily required when additional antibodies are included in the labeling cocktail. 2. Dilute the Sylite solution to a final concentration of 25–100 nM in blocking and permeabilization solution. While labeling is possible at concentrations as low as 1 nM, lower concentrations may result in incomplete labeling and reduced signal intensity. Additional antibodies can be included in the same solution for multichannel imaging. 3. Add 100μL of the Sylite-containing blocking and permeabilization solution onto a flat sheet of Parafilm placed in a 150 mm Petri dish. 4. Carefully pick up the coverslips with forceps, flip them, and place them cell-side down onto the Sylite solution for incubation. Incubate for at least 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Incubation for 30 min or 2 h at room temperature did not show a discernible difference under diffraction-limited imaging; however, 1 h at room temperature is recommended to ensure efficient co-labeling with antibodies in the cocktail. Avoid exposing the samples to strong light after Sylite labeling. For overnight incubation, place a wet Kimwipe inside the Petri dish to maintain humidity and prevent the solution from drying out. 5. Transfer and flip the coverslip back to a 12-well plate. Gently wash the cells with PBS for 5 min on an orbital shaker; repeat the wash three times. 6. Secondary antibody labeling can be performed at this step, if needed. D. Imaging with fluorescence microscope 1. For confocal/STED microscopy, add one drop of ProLong TM Gold antifade mountant onto a clean microscope slide. Pick up the coverslip and gently blot the edge with a Kimwipe to remove excess PBS. Carefully place the coverslip onto the mountant, cell-side down, and avoid trapping air bubbles during mounting. Critical: Sylite with sulfoCy5 labeled, designed for dSTORM, is not photostable enough even with the mountant. Imaging with the sulfoCy5 version of Sylite should be done with less laser power and multiple line average and frame accumulation to increase the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and signal intensity. The STAR635P version of Sylite is photostable and easier to image with confocal and STED microscopy. 2. Allow the mountant to cure at room temperature for 24 h, keeping the slide protected from light during this period. 3. Rinse the coverslip surface with ultrapure water and gently blot dry to remove any residual PBS salts, which can damage the objective lens. Pause point: Mounted coverslips can be stored at 4°C in the dark for several weeks without significant signal loss. 4. Proceed with imaging according to the specific instructions for your microscope system.\n\nValidation of protocol Images of Sylites applications in fixed primary neuron imaging are shown in Figure 2 .

    "title": "Quantifying Intracellular Distributions of HaloTag-Labeled Proteins With SDS-PAGE and Epifluorescence Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Counting protein molecules helps reveal the organization of components within cellular structures and the stoichiometries of protein complexes. Existing protein and peptide quantitation methods vary in their complexity. Here, we report a straightforward workflow to measure the absolute number of HaloTag-labeled myosin 10 (Myo10) molecules in U2OS cells. Myo10 is a motor protein that plays a prominent role in cellular protrusion formation. Various biochemical and biological properties of Myo10 are established, but it is not well-defined how many molecules of Myo10 pack into narrow cellular structures called filopodia. We present a workflow for using SDS-PAGE to calibrate Myo10 signal with a reference protein, segmenting epifluorescence microscopy images to map Myo10 intracellular distribution, and interpreting the results to derive biological and functional insights. Our protocol is simple to employ and not only applicable for Myo10 research but also easily adaptable for other biological systems that use HaloTag. Key features • Combining SDS-PAGE densitometry with epifluorescence microscopy to quantitate HaloTag-labeled proteins in cells with readily available equipment. • Details for quantifying protein signal intensity in cellular compartments with semi-automated image segmentation.",

Laminin coating Aliquot the laminin stock solution (20 µL for a manufacturer’s stock of 2 mg/mL; adjust accordingly) in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes under the tissue culture hood and freeze at -20 °C. On the day of seeding cells on a coverslip, hand-thaw a laminin aliquot vial and add PBS for a final concentration of 20 µg/mL. Gently vortex to mix, then directly pipette 170 µL to each well of the 8-well chambered coverslip or #1.5 coverglass-bottom 35 mm Petri dish with a 10 mm micro-well (round coverslip), ensuring the entire surface area is covered. Incubate the coverslip in the tissue culture incubator for 15–20 min. Aspirate the laminin coating (leaving a tiny film of liquid behind) before seeding cells. Seed cells suspended in DMEM + 10% FBS for 50%–60% cell density on glass. Laminin coating solution can be stored at 4 °C for one week.

GOC improves dye stability by reducing photobleaching. Caution: The substrate oxidation reaction results in acidification of the buffer, so monitor cell health. GOC is not required for the live imaging experiments, though it could help improve dye signal. We have not observed a noticeable difference with or without GOC during live imaging. Combine the catalase and glucose oxidase protein solutions 1:1 in a 3.5 mL thickwall polycarbonate tube, pipette up and down 5× with a 1,000 µL tip, and spin at 95k × g (using Optima Max-XP Tabletop Ultracentrifuge, Rotor TLA 100.3) for 15 min at 4 °C. Spinning removes precipitants in the catalase solution. Keep the supernatant and mix with an equal volume of glycerol. This can be stored as 100 µL aliquots in -20 °C.

Extra-thick western blotting filter paper (Thermo Scientific, catalog number: 88610) 5. 3.5 mL thickwall polycarbonate tube (Beckman Coulter, catalog number: 349622)\n\nProcedure A. Transient transfection of one well of cells in a 6-well dish for cell imaging 1. Equilibrate transfection reagent (FuGENE HD or Lipofectamine 2000) and Opti-MEM to room temperature (RT, ~25 °C). Warm DMEM + 10% FBS to 37 °C. Note: This transfection protocol can be performed using FuGENE HD or Lipofectamine 2000. DNA amounts have been optimized for each transfection reagent based on manual inspection of transfection efficiency across different DNA conditions. 2. Ensure cells in one well of a 6-well dish are at 80%–90% confluency by manual inspection. Note: A subpopulation of cells will die from the toxicity of the transfection reagent, so it is better to plate at this higher density to ensure the majority of cell survival on the day of staining. 3. Perform all the following steps in a tissue culture (TC) hood. Prepare HaloTag-Myo10-FlagTag plasmid stock at ~0.5 µg/µL and calmodulin plasmid stock at ~0.5 µg/µL. For FuGENE HD, proceed to step A4; for Lipofectamine 2000, proceed to step A5. Then, continue to step A6. Note: Co-transfection with calmodulin plasmid is not necessary, but could be useful. The Myo10-positive filopodia phenotype is not noticeably changed by the presence of additional calmodulin. See General notes for more details. 4. If using FuGENE HD: a. In a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, prepare 1 µg of the HaloTag-Myo10-FlagTag plasmid and 0.2 µg of the calmodulin plasmid in a final volume of 200 µL of Opti-MEM. Pipette up and down 20× with a 200 µL tip, careful not to introduce air bubbles. b. Add 3.5:1 FuGENE HD:DNA ratio (4.2 µL of FuGENE HD). Pipette up and down 20× with a 200 µL tip. Incubate the FuGENE/DNA mixture for 10 min at RT to allow complex formation, which will enable efficient cellular uptake of DNA. 5. If using Lipofectamine 2000: a. In a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, prepare 2.5 µg of the HaloTag-Myo10-FlagTag plasmid and 0.2 µg of the calmodulin plasmid in a final volume of 250 µL of Opti-MEM. Pipette up and down 20× with a 200 µL tip, careful not to introduce any air bubbles. b. In another 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, add 2.5:1 Lipofectamine 2000:DNA ratio (6.75 µL of Lipofectamine 2000) to Opti-MEM for a final volume of 250 µL. Pipette up and down 20× with a 200 µL tip. c. Transfer the Lipofectamine solution to the DNA vial. Pipette up and down 20× with a 200 µL tip, careful not to introduce any air bubbles. Incubate the Lipofectamine/DNA mixture for 20 min at RT to allow complex formation, which will enable efficient cellular uptake of DNA. 6. Replace medium in well with 2 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS (warmed to 34–37 °C). 7. Add the total transfection reagent/DNA mixture (200 µL of the FuGENE/DNA mixture, or 500 µL Lipofectamine/DNA mixture) to one confluent well of cells, gently dispersing the mixture drop-by-drop from a 1,000 µL tip across the surface of the cell media. Gently shake the dish to disperse the mixture, then let cells grow in a TC incubator (37 °C, 5% CO 2 ) for 24–48 h. Note: Cells grown at 48 h will have higher protein expression levels than at 24 h. For Myo10, we observed a doubled increase in protein expression with 48 h transfection vs. 24 h. Decide on a transfection time that is suited for your biological system. B. Seeding, collecting cell pellets, and staining cells (fixed and live) 1. Warm up PBS, DMEM + 10% FBS, and accutase to 37 °C. 2. Prepare 20 µg/mL laminin-coated coverslips in TC hood (see Recipe 1) right before seeding cells. Laminin promotes cell attachment to the glass surface, ensuring healthy cell spreading during staining. a. For fixed cell experiments: 8-well chambered coverslip. b. For live cell experiments: round coverslip AND 8-well chambered coverslip. Cells grown in the 8-well chambered coverslip will be fixed and used for measuring transfection efficiency. 3. After 24–48 h of transfection, aspirate the cell media from the well. Do a gentle 400 µL PBS wash, then add 400 µL of accutase to the well. Leave cells in the TC incubator for 15 min for accutase to detach the adherent cells. Note: After transfection, expect ~60%–80% cell viability. 4. Add 500 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS. Collect cells in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Spin at 400× g for 3.5 min at RT. 5. Resuspend the pellet in DMEM + 10% FBS so that each well in the 8-well chambered coverslip and/or round coverslip is at ~50%–60% confluency and filled with at least 200 µL of media. Note: To achieve 50%–60% confluency, aim to seed 62,000–75,000 cells per well in the 8-well chambered coverslip and 100,000–300,000 cells on the round coverslip. Suspend cells in DMEM + 10% FBS at the desired concentration, then gently release cells into the corner of the well so as not to disturb the laminin coating. Ensure the cells are well-dispersed by manually moving the coverslip perpendicularly on the bench, avoiding rotational movement so cells do not clump in the center of the coverslip. 6. Seed the unused cells into a well of the 6-well dish for SDS-PAGE analysis later. Return the 8-well chambered coverslip and/or round coverslip and 6-well dish to the incubator. Note: Cells are collected for SDS-PAGE shortly before staining for imaging to ensure that protein expression levels are comparable between SDS-PAGE analysis and microscopy experiments. 7. After 2–3 h, cells should be attached. First, collect cells for SDS-PAGE analysis prior to fixing cells for microscopy. See section C. 8. Staining fixed cells in the 8-well chambered coverslip (for both live and fixed cell experiments): a. Prepare the fixation and staining solution (see Recipes). Keep on ice. b. Quickly aspirate media from all wells of the 8-well chambered coverslip. Quickly add 200 µL of cold fixation and staining solution to each well, releasing liquid at the corner of the wells so as not to dislodge the cells. Cover with foil and leave in the dark, undisturbed, at RT for 20 min. c. Wash 3× with 250 µL of PBS (4 min each wash) and stain actin in cells with 200 µL of 1 mM Phalloidin-AF647 in 1% BSA (see Recipes). Incubate in the dark at RT for 20 min. d. Wash 3× with 250 µL of PBS (4 min each) before immediate imaging. e. If the fixed cell 8-well chambered coverslip sample is prepared for measuring transfection efficiency of live cell experiments, image this fixed sample after the live cell microscopy session. Note: To prevent photobleaching, cells should be kept in the dark when not being imaged. Image within hours of preparation to ensure samples are fully labeled and not degraded. 9. Staining live cells on the round coverslips: a. Label cells on round coverslips with 200 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS containing 0.75 µM TMR-HaloLigand. Leave in the TC incubator for 15 min. b. Gently wash 2× with 200 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS (warmed to 34–37 °C). c. Image the sample in 200 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS containing 1× GOC. C. Collecting cell lysates for SDS-PAGE 1. Warm up PBS, DMEM + 10% FBS, and accutase to 37 °C. Perform all the following steps in a TC hood at the same time as cells are ready to be stained for microscopy. 2. Aspirate cell media from the transfected well in the 6-well dish. Do a gentle 400 µL PBS wash, then add 400 µL of accutase. Leave cells in the TC incubator for 15 min. Critical: For live-cell experiments, the accutase should also contain 0.75 µM TMR-HaloLigand. Labeling cells while they are still alive, prior to pellet collection, more accurately reflects HaloTag labeling accessibility during live microscopy. 3. Add 500 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS to the well. Collect cells in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Spin at 400× g for 3.5 min at RT. 4. Resuspend the pellet in 200 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS; note that this volume will depend on how many cells you have. Remove 10 µL of cells and combine with 10 µL of 0.4% Trypan blue to count using a hemocytometer. Add another 800 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS to the vial of remaining cells and spin at 400× g for 5 min at RT. 5. Remove the supernatant with a pipette, leaving only the cell pellet in the tube. Use the cell pellet for immediate processing or move the tube directly to -80 °C for storage. Process frozen cell pellets within a year. D. Converting Myo10 signal from SDS gel and microscopy to molecules 1. Prepare cold RIPA buffer (see Recipes) with 1× protease cocktail inhibitor and 1 mM PMSF. Keep on ice. 2. Calculate how much RIPA buffer to suspend the cell pellet so that 5 µL of cell suspension corresponds to 50,000 cells. Pipette each cell pellet 20×, making sure not to generate air bubbles. Leave on ice for 15 min. 3. Spin at 15k × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pipette the supernatant to a new tube without touching the pellet. 4. Incubate 5 µL of lysate from the fixed cell experiments (50,000 cells/5 µL) with 2 µM TMR-HaloLigand in a 10 µL total volume. Leave on ice for 10 min. Note: Any high concentration of TMR-HaloLigand is acceptable (e.g., 2 µM), provided it is in excess relative to Myo10 to ensure complete labeling of tagged-Myo10. Excess TMR-HaloLigand will run faster than the cell lysate during SDS-PAGE. It is unnecessary to incubate the lysates from the live cell experiments because they are already labeled with TMR-HaloLigand. 5. Prepare a 1:500 dilution of the HaloTag standard protein with 0.5 µM TMR-HaloLigand in PBS. Using the 500× dilution, aliquot in protein LoBind tubes at 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 ng in a 10 µL total volume of PBS. Note: If the stock solution of HaloTag standard protein is at 3 mg/mL, then a 1:500 dilution yields a 6 µg/mL solution. Refer to the manufacturer's product sheet for the lot-specific starting concentration of HaloTag standard protein, since it varies by batch. 6. Add 2.5 µL of 5× SDS loading buffer to all the cell lysates and HaloTag standard protein samples. 7. Heat protein samples at 70 °C for 10 min before loading 12.5 µL onto a 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX stain-free protein gel. Run gel at 180 V for 45 min. 8. Take images of the gel on a ChemiDoc in the stain-free, AF647, and rhodamine channels. Note: The stain-free channel (standard filter, UV trans illumination) gives total protein signal, the AF647 channel (695/55 filter, red epi illumination) visualizes the protein ladder, and the rhodamine channel (605/50 filter, green epi illumination) shows TMR. 9. Use the Gel Analysis plug-in in ImageJ to measure signal intensity of the gel bands ( Figure 1 ). a. Use the rectangle tool to draw a box around the first gel band. Include ample space on either side of the gel band when drawing the rectangle for signal integration. Then navigate to Analyze → Gels → Select First Lane . b. Box the subsequent gel band: Analyze → Gels → Select Next Lane. Do this for all gel bands. c. Once all the gel bands are boxed, generate the lane profile plots: Analyze → Gels → Plot Lanes. d. Integrate the signal under the peak. First, use the straight-line selection tool to draw baselines for each peak so that it creates a closed shape. Second, measure the area under each peak by using the wand (tracing) tool and clicking inside the enclosed shape. 10. Plot a standard curve of the HaloTag standard protein TMR signal to estimate the number of Myo10 molecules per cells loaded. Adjust the molecule count by the transfection rate obtained from microscopy and a 90% HaloTag ligand labeling efficiency ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Conversion of Myo10 signal from SDS-PAGE and microscopy to molecule counts. 1) TMR illumination of the SDS-PAGE gel. HaloTag standard protein (lanes A–E, loaded in ng stated above each lane) and cell lysates from six separate U2OS transient transfections (50,000 cells except lane J has 10,000 cells). Lanes F, G, and H: for live-cell analysis. Lanes I, J, and K: for fixed-cell analysis. Bands in the unlabeled wells are from the protein ladder. Signal was integrated for full-length Myo10 (at ~250 kDa) and aggregation in the wells using ImageJ’s Gel Analysis plug-in. 2) The ng amount of HaloTag standard protein loaded is converted to femtomol. 3) Standard curve for TMR signal of HaloTag standard protein (black dots) vs. signal from HaloTag-Myo10 U2OS. y = 24.32x, where the y-intercept is set to 0; R 2 = 0.98. Red dots = fixed-cell experiments; blue dots = live-cell experiments. Gray shading = 95% confidence interval. 4) Converting moles of Myo10 in cells to molecules. 5) Finding the average molecules of Myo10 per cell. 6) Relating SDS-PAGE and microscopy signal to Myo10 molecule counts in segmented regions of the cell. Adapted from [14]. E. Calculate the number of Myo10 molecules per cell from the SDS gel The R code to run a Myo10 signal-to-molecules calibration can be found in the section “Additional files” of the original article [14] in the link “Source code 1.” Open folder MoleculeCalibration → SignaltoMolecules.Rmd . Plug in the signal values integrated from the SDS gel lanes of each cell lysate bioreplicate and HaloTag standard protein dilution series. The code runs a linear regression analysis on the HaloTag standard protein curve for a Myo10 signal-to-molecules conversion. It provides the lower and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval. F. Myo10 western blot 1. Combine 5 µL of cell lysate (at 50,000 cells/5 µL; WT and Myo10-transfected samples) with 5 µL of PBS and 2.5 µL of 5× SDS loading buffer. 2. Heat protein samples at 70 °C for 10 min before loading 12.5 µL onto a 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX stain-free protein gel. Run gel at 180 V for 45 min. 3. Take images of the gel on a ChemiDoc in the stain-free and AF647 channels to visualize total protein signal and ladder. Place the gel into 1× semi-dry transfer buffer. 4. Prepare 1 L of 1× TBST: 100 mL of 10× TBS, 1 mL of 0.1% Tween 20, and 899 mL of H 2 O. 5. Soak filter papers in 1× semi-dry transfer buffer (see Recipes). 6. Activate the PVDF membrane by submerging it in methanol. 7. Assemble blot “sandwich” in the following order (from bottom to top): a. Two filter papers b. Membrane c. Gel (cut to the dimensions of filter papers) d. Two filter papers 8. Roll out air bubbles, then pour 2–3 mL of 1× semi-dry transfer buffer on top to keep it wet. 9. Run blot at 1.3 A constant current and 25 V for 12 min. 10. Block membrane with 5% milk in 1× TBST for 1 h at RT, shaking at 60 rpm. 11. Stain membrane with primary antibodies (10,000× dilution anti-myosin10 rabbit polyclonal, 10,000× dilution anti-beta tubulin mouse monoclonal) in 5% milk in 1× TBST. Leave shaking overnight at 4 °C, or at RT for 1 h, at 60 rpm. 12. Wash 3× with 5% milk or 1× TBST (10 min each wash, shaking at 60 rpm). 13. Stain membrane with secondary antibodies (10,000× dilution rabbit HRP, 10,000× dilution mouse HRP) in 1× TBST. Shake at RT for 1 h at 60 rpm. 14. Wash 3× with 1× TBST (10 min each wash, shaking at 60 rpm). 15. Right before imaging the blot, mix 1 mL of SuperSignal West Femto stable peroxide with 1 mL of Super West Femto luminol/enhancer, then incubate the blot for 2 min inside a Ziploc ( Figure 2 ). Handle the blot with tweezers. 16. Take images of the gel on a ChemiDoc with the setting “Chemi Hi Resolution” ( Figure 3 ). 17. If the number of Myo10 molecules in the transfected cell lysate is known ( Figure 1 ), the ratio of western blot signals between the two lanes can be used to estimate what proportion of the Myo10 signal in the transfected sample comes from endogenous protein ( Figure 3 ). Figure 2. Developing western blot for visualization. Incubate the blot in an equal mix of peroxide and enhancer inside a Ziploc for 2 min before imaging on a ChemiDoc. Figure 3. Western blot of Myo10 in U2OS cells. Left: SDS-PAGE gel of wildtype U2OS (WT) vs. U2OS transfected with HaloTag-Myo10 (M10). 50,000 cells per lane. Right: Western blot of Myo10 (NBP1-87748) and β-tubulin and loading control (Invitrogen, catalog number: 22833). There are very low endogenous Myo10 levels in U2OS. Image is reproduced from [14]. G. Verifying labeling efficiency of TMR-HaloLigand 1. Dilute the HaloTag standard protein to 8 µM in a 20 µL reaction volume of PBS. Add TMR-HaloLigand in 5× molar excess (final 40 µM). Incubate on ice for 10 min. Note: For reference, the HaloTag standard protein is 61,000 g/mol. HaloTag standard protein provided at 3 mg/mL is 49.18 µM. To prepare HaloTag standard protein at 8 µM, combine 3.25 µL of HaloTag standard protein with 1.6 µL of TMR-HaloLigand (500 µM) and 15.15 µL of PBS. 500 µM TMR-HaloLigand can be prepared by combining 1 µL of stock 5 mM TMR-HaloLigand with 9 µL of DMSO. 2. Measure the A 280 with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer as the “pre-beads” concentration; this is to verify that the starting concentration is as expected. In the NanoDrop menu, select Proteins → Protein A 280 → Sample type: 1 Abs = 1 mg/mL (baseline correction at 340 nm) . 3. Fill a 1.5 mL protein LoBind tube with Bio-Beads SM-2 to the ~10 µL volume mark. Wash beads by vortexing and discarding each wash buffer as follows: 400 µL of methanol 3×, distilled water 3×, and PBS 3×. Vortex for 3 s and pipette off buffer after each wash. 4. Aspirate liquid and add 20 µL of labeled HaloTag standard protein. Incubate for 2 h at RT in the dark. 5. Spin down the beads at 600× g for 3 min at RT. Note: At this point, the solution should no longer be pink because excess TMR-HaloLigand should be absorbed by the beads ( Figure 4 ). If the beads are not pink and the solution is still pink, use more beads or let the incubation proceed longer. Figure 4. Absorbing excess TMR-HaloLigand with Bio-Beads. Left: Protein solution is pink when excess TMR-HaloLigand is unbound. Right: Protein solution becomes clear once excess TMR-HaloLigand is bound by Bio-Beads. 6. Recover the supernatant and measure the protein and dye absorbances ( Figure 5 ): in the NanoDrop menu, select Proteins → Protein A280 → Sample type: 1 Abs = 1 mg/mL (baseline correction at 340 nm). Measure absorbance at 533 nm: in the NanoDrop menu, select Custom → UV-Vis → 533 nm. Note: For reference, the TMR extinction coefficient is 7.8 × 10 4 M -1 ·cm -1 . To calculate the concentration of TMR-HaloLigand from absorbance, use the formula: concentration = absorbance/(extinction coefficient * path length). See Table 1 for example calculations. Figure 5. Absorbance spectrum of post-bead labeled HaloTag standard protein. Spectrum shown is a zoom-in of the red boxed region in the top right inset. Plot is adapted from [14]. 7. Combine 10 µL of protein and 2.5 µL of 5× SDS loading buffer. Heat protein samples at 70 °C for 10 min before loading 12.5 µL onto a 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX stain-free protein gel. Run gel at 180 V for 45 min. 8. Take images of the gel on a ChemiDoc in the stain-free and rhodamine channels. 9. Use the Gel Analysis plug-in in ImageJ to measure signal intensity of the gel bands. Note: Knowing this value allows you to account for protein that may have nonspecifically bound to the beads. Compare the signal intensities of pre- and post-bead gel bands to correct for the post-beads protein concentration value. See Table 1 for example calculations. Table 1. Calculating HaloTag degree of labeling with TMR-HaloLigand. Example calculations for two technical replicates. (A) Starting concentration of HaloTag standard protein. (B) Ratio of the integrated signal of HaloTag standard protein well from gel, pre-, and post-beads. (C) Multiply (A) by (B) for the concentration of HaloTag standard protein post-beads, which is also the expected concentration of TMR-HaloLigand if 100% labeling has occurred. (D) Absorbance at 553 nm of protein solution post-beads. (E) Concentration of TMR-HaloLigand based on (D). (F) Percentage of HaloTag standard protein labeled by TMR-HaloLigand, calculated by (E)/(C). Table is adapted from [14]. Measurement Rep 1 Rep 2 (A) Pre-beads protein (µM) 6.8 6.8 (B) Post/pre-beads gel signal 0.58 0.62 (C) Post-beads expected dye (µM) (i.e., post-beads protein) 3.9 4.2 (D) Post-beads Abs553 0.28 0.30 (E) Post-beads dye (µM) 3.6 3.8 (F) % dye labeling 0.91 0.90 H. Ensuring TMR-HaloLigand labeling saturation in cells (fixed and live) 1. Seed cells onto laminin-coated coverslip as described in section B. a. For fixed cells: 6 wells of an 8-well chambered coverslip. b. For live cells: 6 round coverslips. 2. Create a 20 µM dilution of TMR-HaloLigand into DMSO. In the following steps, working solutions will be made at the final concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 2.5µM. 3. Staining fixed cells: a. Make a fixation buffer base containing 4% PFA, 0.08% Triton, and 1:1,000 DAPI in PEM buffer. Keep on ice. b. Add TMR-HaloLigand to reach the final concentrations listed in step H2. Keep on ice. c. Quickly aspirate cell media from all 6 wells and quickly add 200 µL of the fixation/staining buffer to each well, releasing liquid at the corner of the wells so as not to dislodge the cells. Leave in the dark, undisturbed at RT for 20 min. d. Wash 3× with 250 µL of PBS (4 min each wash) and stain actin in cells with 200 µL of 1 mM Phalloidin-AF647 in 1% BSA (see Recipes). Incubate in the dark at RT for 20 min. e. Wash 3× with 250 µL of PBS (4 min each) before immediate imaging ( Figure 6A ). Figure 6. 0.5 µM TMR-HaloLigand saturates Myo10 labeling in U2OS cells. (A) In live cells: Higher HaloTag ligand-TMR concentrations increased total intracellular Myo10 signal (left) due to uneven background, artificially inflating measurements. Punctate signal (right) reveals true saturation at 0.5 µM. (B) In fixed cells: Total (left) and punctate (right) Myo10 signals saturate at 0.5 µM TMR-HaloTag ligand. Based on Table 1 , we estimate that 90% of HaloTag-Myo10 is labeled at 0.5 µM saturation in both live and fixed cells. Image is reproduced from [14]. 3. Staining live cells: a. Add TMR-HaloLigand into prewarmed (34–37 °C) DMEM + 10% FBS to prepare 200 µL solutions at the final concentrations listed above. Incubate in the dark in the TC incubator. b. Gently wash 2× with 200 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS (warmed to 34–37 °C). c. Image the sample in 200 µL of DMEM + 10% FBS containing 1× GOC ( Figure 6B ). I. Imaging cells (fixed and live) 1. Use an Axiovert microscope with a 60× water objective (or any other suitable objective). The signal read-out should be below detector saturation. a. For live cells only: Heat the objective to 37 °C for 45 min prior to imaging to equilibrate the temperature of the objective. Note: A water objective is not crucial. Choose an objective with a magnification sufficient to capture the whole cell (>60×) and a high numerical aperture (>1.2×) to resolve fine structures like filopodia. 2. Imaging fixed cells: a. Set camera gain (if using) and exposure. Pixel values should use the entire dynamic range of the camera, but must be below camera saturation. b. Image TMR channel first (520 nm green light) and then AF633 (630 nm red light). Image immediately upon illumination of the field of view. Save the image as a stack in Micro-Manager. c. Using the same camera exposure and gain settings, collect 50 images for each bioreplicate, collecting 150 images across three bioreplicates. 3. Imaging live cells: a. Set camera gain (if using) and exposure; 300 ms is a recommended exposure time since it captures sufficient signal of the entire filopodial lifecycle. Pixel values should use the entire dynamic range of the camera, but must be below camera saturation. b. Record 10 random cells in the TMR channel, recording videos for <6 min or until the cell starts dying and/or rounds up. Save each movie as a stack in Micro-Manager. c. Using the same camera exposure and gain settings, collect 30 images across 3 bioreplicates. For each bioreplicate, take snapshots of ~50 living cells to sample the fluorescence intensity distribution for the signal-to-molecule conversions. 4. Record the transfection efficiency using the fixed-cell sample. Survey at least 100 random cells to check the transfection rate. Scan across the sample, stopping to image whenever cells are in frame. First, count the number of cells with DAPI signal in the UV channel, then change to the TMR channel to count the number of Myo10 positively expressing cells. Record this transfection rate. It is not necessary to store these images.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: • Shangguan and Rock [14] Hundreds of myosin 10 s are pushed to the tips of filopodia and could cause traffic jams on actin. eLife ( Figures 1 –4, Figure 1 supplement 1, Figure 2 supplements 1–2, Figure 3 supplements 1–3, Figure 4 supplement 1). In this work, 150 cells from three bioreplicates were analyzed for the fixed cell experiments, and 30 cells from 3 bioreplicates were analyzed for the live cell experiments.\n\nSupplementary information The following supporting information can be downloaded here : 1.

    "title": "In Vitro Assay to Examine Osteoclast Resorptive Activity Under Estrogen Withdrawal.",
    "abstract": "The bone is a highly dynamic organ that undergoes continuous remodeling through an intricate balance of bone formation and degradation. Hyperactivation of the bone-degrading cells, the osteoclasts (OCs), occurs in disease conditions and hormonal changes in females, resulting in osteoporosis, a disease characterized by altered microarchitecture of the bone tissue, and increased bone fragility. Thus, building robust assays to quantify OC resorptive activity to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying bone degradation is critical. Here, we establish an in vitro model to investigate the effect of estrogen withdrawal on OCs derived from the mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line in a bone biomimetic microenvironment. This simple and robust model can also be adapted to examine the effect of drugs and genetic factors influencing OC resorptive activity in addition to being compatible with fluorescent imaging. Key features • A robust in vitro protocol that allows molecular and functional studies of mature osteoclasts in response to estrogen and its withdrawal. • Generation of inorganic bone-mimetic substrates for culturing and examining osteoclast resorptive behavior. • This quantitative image-based approach is compatible with brightfield and fluorescence microscopy to assess osteoclast resorptive activity.",

Slide folder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number: 12-587-10)\n\nProcedure A. Preparation of a bone biomimetic microenvironment Preparation of biomimetic bone substrate was first reported by Maria et al. [15] and Patntirapong et al. [20]. The inorganic bone layer produced using this protocol is chemically and structurally similar to in vivo bone mineral. This two-step method produces a stable, consistent crystal structure that is suitable for both OC differentiation and bone resorption [15,20]. Our method includes a maximum recommended shelf-life for the stock solutions and coated coverslips, in addition to a change in the preparation of the coverslips for cell culturing. A visual of the workflow involved is provided in Figure 1A . Figure 1. Preparing biomimetic bone coverslips. A. This process involves the preparation of a biomimetic bone substrate following protocols adapted from Maria et al. [15] and Patntirapong et al. [20]. Key steps are (1) making stock solutions with precise pH requirements; (2) establishing a pre-calcification layer on coverslips using simulated body fluid (SBF); (3) producing the calcium phosphate top layer; and (4) sterilization and storage of coated coverslips for future experiments. B. Representative images of a growing nucleation layer (Day 2 and 3) and a completed calcium phosphate–coated coverslip. Images were acquired using DIC with a 20× objective. Scale bar = 100 μm. 1. Making stock solutions Critical: The key to successfully preparing the final (SBF) solution is to ensure that all stock solutions have the correct pH. Adjust pH slowly and only use Milli-Q water when water is a required reagent. Note: Choose an analytical balance with 100 mg minimum weight and 0.1 mg readability. A balance with a draft shield is recommended. a. Autoclave three 250 mL bottles and one 500 mL bottle. Note: Allow bottles to fully cool before adding solutions. b. Prepare Tris base stock buffer solution in a 1,000 mL beaker using a magnetic stir rod and plate (see Recipe 1). c. Keep Tris base stock solution in the beaker while preparing the calcium and phosphate stock solutions. d. Prepare calcium stock solution using 90 mL of Tris base stock solution in a 500 mL beaker using a magnetic stir rod and plate (see Recipe 2). e. Set aside the calcium stock solution, leaving it in the beaker. f. Prepare phosphate stock solution in 90 mL of Tris base stock solution in a 500 mL beaker using a magnetic stir rod and plate (see Recipe 3). g. Set aside the phosphate stock solution, leaving it in the beaker. h. Prepare the calcium phosphate solution in a 500 mL beaker using a magnetic stir rod and plate (see Recipe 4). i. Transfer each solution into a labeled and pre-sterilized glass bottle using a 0.22 μm bottle top filter. Note 1: Use a vacuum aspirator to aid filtration. Attach aspirator tubing to the tapered connector of the bottle top filter. Note 2: Performing this step in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet is recommended to ensure sterility. j. All sterile solutions should be kept at room temperature. Use within 1 month. 2. Establishing a pre-calcification/nucleation layer on coverslips with simulated body fluid a. Prepare 12-well tissue culture plates with 18 mm coverslips. Optional: Coverslips can be pre-sterilized in 70% ethanol and washed with sterile distilled water before addition to the tissue culture wells. This step can be prepared in advance. b. Prepare simulated body fluid (SBF) in a 50 or 100 mL graduated cylinder according to recipe 5. c. Seal the graduated cylinder with parafilm and mix with gentle inversion. Mix five times. Note: The solution should remain clear after mixing. If the mixed solution appears cloudy or has a visible precipitate, then recheck the pH of each solution. d. Add 1.0 mL of SBF to each well. Note 1: Add the solution slowly to the side of the well. Note 2: To achieve an even biomimetic layer across the coverslip, avoid circular movements with the plate, as this can cause mineral accumulation at the center of the well. Instead, employ a gentle side-to-side or up-and-down motion to evenly distribute the minerals. e. Leave the tissue culture plates undisturbed at room temperature for 24 h. f. Aspirate the SBF solution from each well carefully. Note: Remove the solution from the side of the well, paying attention to avoid disturbing the amorphous calcification layer. g. Repeat steps A2b–f for two additional days. A representative image of the nucleation layer on Day 2 and 3 of the process is provided in Figure 1B . 3. Production of the calcium phosphate top layer on coverslips a. Aspirate the SBF solution from each well carefully and then add 1.0 mL of calcium phosphate solution (see Recipe 4) to the side of each well. b. Leave the tissue culture plates undisturbed at room temperature for 24 h. c. Slowly aspirate the calcium phosphate solution from the side of each well. A representative image of the completed top layer of calcium phosphate is provided in Figure 1B . 4. Sterilization and storage of coated coverslips housed within tissue culture plates Note: Biomimetic substrate production is complete, and the following steps prepare the substrate for cell culture. Perform all remaining steps in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet to maintain sterility. a. Add 1.0 mL of 70% ethanol to the side of each well for 20 min to sterilize the substrate. b. Aspirate the 70% ethanol from the side of each well and allow any remaining ethanol to evaporate for 1 h. c. Wash the substrate-coated coverslips twice with autoclaved distilled water under sterile conditions. d. Transfer the tissue culture plates to a 37 °C non-humidified incubator for 24 h. e. Tissue culture plates with substrate-coated coverslips can be used for experiments immediately or stored at room temperature for later use. For long-term storage, seal the sides of the tissue culture plates with thin strips of parafilm to prevent contamination and stack the plates in a sealable bag. Use within 3 months. B. Osteoclast culturing and estrogen withdrawal treatment A simplified visual showing the timeline of events for osteoclast formation and estrogen treatment is provided in Figure 2A . Figure 2. Protocol for osteoclast formation and treatment of cells under 17β-estradiol (E2) and E2-withdrawal (E2-WD) conditions. A. On Day 1, RAW 264.7 cells are seeded on biomimetic calcium phosphate–coated coverslips in AMEM + 10% FBS under the following conditions: 50 ng/mL RANKL for control and 50 ng/mL RANKL + 10 nM of 17β-estradiol for E2 and E2-WD. For the E2 condition, 10 nM of 17β-estradiol is added daily from Days 1 to 4. For E2-WD, 10 nM of 17β-estradiol is added daily on Days 1–2. On Day 3, AMEM + 50 ng/mL RANKL is replaced for all three conditions. On Day 5, the experiment is terminated for all conditions. B. Representative DIC images of the cell population from each day of treatment. Scale bar = 100 μm. 1. Passaging RAW 264.7 cells Note 1: Perform all steps under sterile conditions, in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet. Note 2: RAW 264.7 cells are cultured and differentiated using medium supplemented with heat-inactivated FBS. a. Maintain RAW 264.7 cells in T-75 cell culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. Note: Passage RAW cells twice a week as the flask population reaches 80%–90% confluency. b. Remove old medium and add 10 mL of fresh prewarmed DMEM + 10% FBS medium. Using a sterile cell scraper, gently harvest cells from the tissue culture flask and, using a 5 or 10 mL disposable serological pipette, break cell clumps through gentle pipetting. c. Transfer 1 mL of harvested RAW cells into a fresh flask containing 9 mL of prewarmed DMEM + 10% FBS. Mix by gentle pipetting to avoid creating bubbles before returning the flask to a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , humidified incubator. 2. Prepare substrate-coated coverslips for cell culturing a. Under sterile conditions, prepare a stock solution of 50% heat-inactivated FBS with AMEM. b. Add 1 mL/well to tissue culture plates containing substrate-coated coverslips. c. Place tissue culture plates in a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , humidified incubator for 18–24 h. 3. Cell plating density and osteoclast differentiation medium a. Transfer 2 mL of cells from Step B1 to a 15 mL conical tube containing 8 mL of prewarmed AMEM +10% FBS. Mix cells through gentle pipetting. For cell counting, use a sterile pipette tip to transfer 10 μL of cell suspension to a hemocytometer. Using a light microscope, focus on the grid lines of the hemocytometer using a 10× objective. b. For cell seeding in a 12-well plate, prepare three labeled 15 mL conical tubes each containing 6 × 10 4 cells/mL in prewarmed AMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Tube 1 is for the control (untreated osteoclasts) group, Tube 2 is for the continuous 17β-estradiol (E2) group, and Tube 3 is for E2-withdrawal (E2-WD) group. Note 1: The total volume for each tube depends on the number of wells needed for each experimental condition. Note 2: The number of cells used in seeding will change with the size of the well. For 24-well plates, we recommend using 10,000–15,000 cells/mL. Note 3: To maintain consistency across replicates, using RAW cells between passage 3 and 13 is recommended. We have observed reduced osteoclast formation in older passages. Note 4: Prepare three biological replicates for each condition. c. For all three tubes, add RANKL to a final concentration of 50 ng/mL using fully thawed stock RANKL. Mix thoroughly with a 10 mL serological pipette. Note: Maintain a master stock of 100 μg/mL RANKL in 50 μL aliquots at -20 °C. Thaw a single aliquot each week and store at 4 °C. Discard any remaining aliquot after 7 days. We find this avoids any potential challenges with RANKL degradation and loss of potency. 4. Estrogen withdrawal treatment a. For the continuous E2 and E2-WD group, add 10 nM of thawed E2 to the previously prepared 15 mL conical tubes (step B3b), a concentration within the physiological range in mouse serum [21]. Mix thoroughly with a 10 mL pipette to evenly distribute the E2. Note: E2 is dissolved in DMSO as a stock solution of 100 mM, divided into 100 μL aliquots, and stored at -20 °C. Use the resuspended E2 stock solution within 6 months. Before each experiment, prepare a working stock of 10 μM in DMSO. The working stock is used for the duration of a single experiment and is stored at -20 °C. b. Remove tissue culture plates containing substrate-coated coverslips from the humidified incubator and aspirate the 50% heat-inactivated FBS with AMEM. Label tissue culture wells prior to the addition of appropriate cell suspension + treatment. c. Add 1 mL of cell suspension + treatment/well (Day 1) and incubate the plates in a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 humidified incubator. d. For the E2 group, add 10 nM of E2 every day (Days 1–4). For cells in the E2-WD group, add 10 nM of E2 for Day 1 and 2. Note: For all conditions, remove medium and replace with fresh AMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 ng/mL of RANKL on Day 3 . e. On Day 3, for the E2-WD group, wash cells with 1 mL of AMEM three times to remove residual traces of E2. Add fresh AMEM + RANKL and continue to grow cells in the absence of E2 until Day 5. Representative DIC images of the OC population on each day of the experiment are provided in Figure 2B . f. On Day 5, terminate the experiment by cell removal from the substrate (see below; section C) or by cell fixation, followed by permeabilization and fluorescent staining (see below; section D). C. Osteoclast removal and calcium phosphate (modified Von Kossa) staining 1. Osteoclast removal from biomimetic bone substrate a. Prepare cell removal solution according to Recipe 6. b. Aspirate media from the 12-well plate. c. Wash each well twice with 1.0 mL of distilled water. d. Add 1 mL/well of cell removal solution. Leave for 5 min. e. Aspirate the cell removal solution and wash each well with 1.0 mL of distilled water twice. 2. Calcium phosphate staining with silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) solution a. In a fume hood, add 0.5 mL of 2.5% AgNO 3 solution to each well. Caution: AgNO 3 solution is an eye and skin irritant. Perform all work in a fume hood. b. Keep plates treated with 2.5% AgNO 3 solution under direct light for 30 min to 1 h or until a dark-brown-to-black stain (see Figure 3A ) has developed. Figure 3. Steps to mount calcium phosphate-coated coverslip. A. Calcium phosphate–coated coverslip treated with 2.5% AgNO 3 solution. Image shows a coated coverslip placed under direct light before (i) and after (ii) a 1 h incubation with 2.5% AgNO 3 solution, developing a visible dark-brown-to-black stain. B. To mount the biomimetic-coated coverslip, apply a single drop of mounting medium to the glass slide surface before gently lowering the coated coverslip with the calcium phosphate–coated side up and away from the slide, then applying another drop of mounting medium and covering with a second clean coverslip. c. In a fume hood, remove 2.5% AgNO 3 solution with a pipette and dispose of it in a designated waste container. Caution: AgNO 3 is an acute and chronic aquatic hazard. Do not wash down drains. Identify the designated waste container with an Environmental Health and Safety–recognized chemical waste label and store the container according to directions from the facility’s Environmental Protection Services department. d. Wash each well with 1.0 mL of distilled water twice. Pipette the wash volume into the designated waste container. 3. Imaging resorption pits a. In a pop-up slide folder, place labeled glass slides and apply a small amount of DAKO mounting medium to the surface of the slide. Using fine-tip tweezers, place the edge of the coverslip over the mounting medium and carefully lower the coverslip to avoid creating bubbles. Note: For improved resolution of the resorption pits, face the calcium phosphate–coated side away from the slide glass surface ( Figure 3B ). Apply a drop of mounting media on top of the calcium phosphate material and carefully mount another coverslip on top, so that the calcium phosphate–coated coverslip is sandwiched as depicted in Figure 3B . Let the assembly dry inside a closed folder for 24 h . b. Using a 20× or 40× objective, image 5–10 sections of the coverslip with brightfield microscopy. D. Osteoclast fixation and actin cytoskeleton staining 1. OC fixation and permeabilization a. Aspirate media from the 12-well plate. b. Wash each well twice with 1.0 mL of room-temperature PBS. c. Add 0.5 mL/well of 4% PFA. Add the PFA to the side of the well. Leave the plate covered in darkness at room temperature for 20 min. d. Aspirate the PFA from each well and wash each well twice with 1.0 mL of PBS. Pause point: The plate can be sealed with parafilm and placed at 4 °C to continue staining at a later time. Store the plate at 4 °C with 1.0 mL of PBS/well and stain cells within one week of fixation. e. Add 0.5 mL of permeabilization buffer to each well. Leave the plate covered in darkness at room temperature for 15 min. f. Wash each well twice with 1.0 mL of room-temperature PBS. 2. Blocking non-specific binding a. In a 15 mL conical tube, prepare a solution of 5% FBS in PBS. b. Aspirate the PBS from each well. Add 0.5 mL of 5% FBS block to each well and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Cover the 12-well plate with a box to prevent direct light exposure. 3. Actin and nuclei staining Note: Prepare and store Phalloidin and DAPI according to the manufacturer’s instructions. a. In a 15 mL conical tube, prepare the staining buffer as a solution of 2% FBS in PBS. Calculate the total volume of staining buffer needed. For a 12-well plate, use 0.5 mL/well. Note: Include an extra sample in the total volume calculation to accommodate for pipetting errors. For example, prepare 6.5 mL of staining buffer for 12 wells. b. Add a 1:250–1:500 dilution of Phalloidin 488 to the staining buffer prepared in step D3a. c. Add 0.5 mL/well of Phalloidin staining solution, cover the plate, and leave for 1 h at room temperature. Avoid direct light exposure. d. Aspirate the staining buffer and wash each well twice with 1.0 mL of room-temperature PBS and once with 1.0 mL of double-distilled water. e. In a 15 mL conical tube, prepare a 1:1,000 dilution of DAPI (final concentration of 1–2 μg/mL) in double-distilled water. f. Add 1 mL/well of DAPI staining solution, cover the plate, and leave for 10 min at room temperature. Avoid direct light exposure. g. Aspirate the DAPI staining solution and wash the wells twice with 1.0 mL of double-distilled water. 4. Imaging osteoclasts a. In a pop-up slide folder, place labeled glass slides and mount each coverslip using the method shown in Figure 3B . b. Using a 40×–63× objective, image 5–10 sections of the coverslip with a fluorescence microscope that contains excitation and emission filters suitable for imaging the fluorescent probes, DAPI and Phalloidin 488. Examples of osteoclasts stained on calcium phosphate–coated coverslips and imaged with a fluorescence microscope are provided in Figure 4 . Figure 4. Osteoclasts in control conditions, fixed and stained on calcium phosphate–coated coverslips. Representative confocal images of OCs on each day of treatment. Actin (Phalloidin) and nuclei (DAPI) are shown. Inset, the biomimetic substrate is shown with DIC. Day 2 and 3 populations are mostly mononuclear cells. Osteoclasts (cells with 3 or more nuclei) are observed on Day 4 and 5. Scale bar = 100 μm.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article(s): Gandhi et al. [14].

    "title": "Visualization of F-Actin Through Expansion Microscopy (ExM) with Trifunctional Linker-Conjugated Phalloidin.",
    "abstract": "Expansion microscopy (ExM) is an imaging technique that enables super-resolution imaging of biological specimens using conventional confocal microscopy. This process entails the isotropic physical expansion of a (biomolecular) sample that has been cross-linked to a swellable polymer. The grafting of biomolecules (and the subsequent fluorescent readout) is accomplished by introducing an acryloyl group to the amine groups of lysine residues within the proteins, enabling subsequent imaging. However, visualizing actin filaments with high spatial resolution using ExM remains challenging. Herein, we report the construction of a phalloidin conjugate containing actin stains and their application in ExM. This protocol highlights the efficacy of trifunctional linker (TRITON/Actin-ExM) for F-actin imaging, demonstrating that TRITON-labeled actin allows for efficient anchoring and signal retention, enabling robust visualization of actin filaments in expansion microscopy. Key features • Engineered linker (TRITON) design ensures efficient fluorophore attachment, resulting in bright, stable signals during imaging. • Performed pre-expansion and antibody-free labeling. • Detailed and specific visualization of actin filaments in ExM experiments (4-fold expansion).",

Sigma-coated cover glass preparation for gelation chamber 1. Etch the slides with a diamond scribe to indicate which side has the sample (see Figure S1). After thorough cleaning, the slides can be reused approximately five times, alleviating the need to make new slides each time. 2. Prepare Sigma-coated cover glasses: apply undiluted Sigmacote solution to the cover glasses by placing them in a glass Petri dish, ensuring complete and uniform coverage. After an exposure time of 2 min, carefully remove the cover glasses and allow to air dry. This 2-min incubation period allows the coating to fully render the surface hydrophobic. 3. Pipette the Sigmacote back into the designated recycling bottle. Any excess solution can be collected and reused. B. Coverslip glass washing 1. Soak the coverslip in 50 mL of 1 M HCl overnight. 2. Place the coverslip in a 100 mL clean beaker. Add 50 mL of MQ water to completely cover the coverslip. Gently swirl the container to rinse the coverslip, ensuring that the MQ water flows over its entire surface for 1 min. Repeat the rinsing process 2–3 times to ensure thorough cleaning. 3. Rinse the coverslip with 50 mL of ethanol in a 100 mL beaker for an additional 1 min. 4. Place the treated glass on the Parafilm and allow the treated glass surface to air dry in a fume hood. C. Cell culture HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM with high glucose (4.5 g/L, without glutamine and phenol red), supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 50 μg/mL gentamicin, and 1% GlutaMAX, at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . Upon reaching 70%–80% confluency, the cells were washed three times with 1× DPBS (without calcium and magnesium) and detached using Trypsin-EDTA. Cells were then seeded onto 22 mm × 22 mm #1.5 coverslips at a density of 4.0 × 10 5 cells/cm 2 and incubated overnight prior to fixation. 1. Growth medium: 445 mL of DMEM (1×) + 50 mL of FBS + 5 mL of GlutaMAX + 500 μL of gentamicin. 2. Remove medium from cells. 3. Wash 3× with ~10 mL of PBS (in a T75 flask). 4. Add 1.2 mL of PBS + 0.3 mL of Trypsin-EDTA 0.5% (5×). 5. Incubate at 37 °C for 1–2 min. 6. Add 8.5 mL of DMEM growth medium and detach cells by pipetting up and down. 7. Transfer to a 15 mL Falcon tube. 8. Add 10 μL of cell suspension to 10 μL of trypan blue, mix, dispense 10 μL on the counting chamber, and count cells. 9. Seed 1,200,000 cells (seeding volume = 1,200,000/count number). 10. Add DMEM growth medium to reach 10 mL. 11. Incubate cells in a 37 °C CO 2 incubator (until 70%–80% confluent). D. Fixing cells The procedure for fixing cells is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Workflow for fixing HeLa cells before the staining step. (1) Carefully place the clean #1.5 coverslips flat at the bottom of the 6-well plate using sterile tweezers. Seed approximately 400,000 HeLa cells per well in a total volume of 2 mL. First, add 1 mL of medium to each well, then distribute the HeLa cells evenly in droplets across the coverslip for a uniform cell layer. (2) Incubate overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . (3) Remove the old medium and fix the cells by adding 1 mL of 4% PFA in PBS. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature (25 °C). (4) Quench the PFA by incubating the specimen in 1 mL of 100 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Wash the specimen with 1 mL of PBS and repeat three times for 5 min each. Store the specimen in PBS. If needed, it can be kept at 4 °C for up to two days. (5) Permeabilize the sample by adding 1 mL of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubating at room temperature for 15 min. E. Staining 1. Wash the samples with 1 mL of PBS, repeating three times for 5 min each. 2. Prepare the phalloidin staining solution by diluting it to a final concentration of 0.25 μM in PBS. Use 100 μL of solution per sample, ensuring sufficient volume for three replicate samples. Combine 2.5 μL of the concentrated stock phalloidin solution (TRITON) with 97.5 μL of the diluent PBS, yielding a total volume of 100 μL of the diluted solution. Vortex the mixture for 5–10 s to ensure thorough mixing and uniform distribution of the stock solution within the diluent, resulting in a final concentration of 0.25 μM. 3. Place 100 μL of the staining solution onto a piece of parafilm (see Figure S3) and position the coverslip upside-down over the drop, ensuring the cell layer contacts the staining solution. 4. Cover the setup with aluminum foil and incubate for 1 h at RT. 5. Return the coverslip to the well dish, with the cells facing up, and wash with PBS (3× 5 min). 6. If DAPI staining is desired, prepare a 1 mg/mL DAPI stock (1,000×), then add 1 μL of DAPI to 1 mL of PBS. Incubate for 5 min, followed by washing with PBS (3× 5 min). F. Image before ExM 1. Use a pipette tip to gently scratch a cross in the center of the coverslip, ensuring that the intersection is precisely at the center. On the side of the coverslip without cells, mark the center of the cross with a lab marker. This step is performed to create distinct markers on the sample, which serve as reference points for precise alignment during imaging. 2. For imaging preparation (see Figure S4), use a microscope slide with a single concave side. Add 85 μL of PBS into the hole, then place the coverslip upside down over it, ensuring the cell side faces the PBS. Seal the edges of the coverslip with photo glue and wait for 10 min. Once sealed, the sample is ready for imaging. 3. Photobleaching procedure: Utilize a fluorescent confocal microscope equipped with a high-power 405 nm diode laser to scan the specific cell for 1 min, until the selected nuclei darken, as shown in Figure 2A . Record the X and Y dimensions of the bleached region for subsequent calculations of the expansion factor. Figure 2.

(B) Magnified views of the boxed region in panel (A). (C) Post-expansion image of actin filaments with TRITON. (D) Magnified views of the boxed region in panel (C). G. General anchoring 1. Thaw the 0.1 mg/mL AcX solution (mix 10 μL of AcX with 990 μL of PBS) (see Recipes). 2. Incubate the sample in a plastic 6-well plate with 1 mL of the AcX solution at RT overnight. 3. Wash the sample in a plastic 6-well plate by gently adding 1 mL of PBS to the well. After 15 min, carefully aspirate the PBS and repeat this wash step two times to ensure complete removal of excess reagents before proceeding with gelation. H. Gelation 1. Prepare an ice container to keep reagents chilled during the process. 2. Set up the gelation chambers by placing a #1.5 coverslip at each end of a Sigmacote-treated slide. Secure the coverslips using binder clips at both ends. 3. Prepare the active monomer solution (200 μL per sample) (see Recipes) and keep it on ice until needed. Add APS and TEMED to the solution just before use. 4. Wash the cells once with 100 μL of activated monomer solution on the coverslip surface. Then, pipette 80 μL of the solution as a drop onto the center of the Sigmacote-treated coverslip in the gelation chamber. 5. Place the coverslip with cells onto the gelation chamber (for a detailed picture, see Figure S5), ensuring the cells are positioned face down. 6. Secure the coverslip in place using binder clips, positioned only where the coverslips overlap. 7. Incubate the gels in a nitrogen-purged container (e.g., a plastic box with a lid, with two drilled holes, purged for 1 min), and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C. 8. After gelation, remove the binder clips and spacer slides (see Figure S5A). Use two razor blades to cut the gel into the desired asymmetric shape. 9. Transfer the coverslip with the cut gel directly into a 6-well plate and wash with 1 mL of digestion buffer. 10. Digest the sample overnight at RT using 1.5 mL of digestion solution (see Recipes) containing 8 units/mL Proteinase K [prepared by adding 15 μL of Proteinase K (800 units/mL) to 1.485 mL of digestion solution]. 11. Wash the sample with PBS twice for 15 min at room temperature. I. Image post-digestion (optional) 1. Transfer the cut gel to an imaging dish by using PBS and a paintbrush to gently slide the gel off the coverslip into the dish, ensuring the cells face downward. 2. Capture images to assess the quality and/or proceed with the expansion process. J. Poly-L-lysine-coated imaging well preparation for post-ExM imaging 1. Add 1 mL of 0.01% (w/v) poly-L-lysine solution to each well for coating. 2. Incubate at RT for 30 min. 3. Remove the poly-L-lysine solution and wash the well with MQ water. 4. Remove the MQ water and allow the well to air dry. 5. Each well can be used only once for each gel. K. Expansion and imaging 1. Incubate the gel in MQ water five times for 10 min each to ensure adequate dialysis. 2. Remove as much MQ water as possible after each incubation. 3. Gently transfer the expanded gel to a poly-L-lysine-coated imaging well and proceed with imaging.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol was used in: 1. Wen et al. [6].

    "title": "Live Leaf-Section Imaging for Visualizing Intracellular Chloroplast Movement and Analyzing Cell-Cell Interactions.",
    "abstract": "In response to environmental changes, chloroplasts, the cellular organelles responsible for photosynthesis, undergo intracellular repositioning, a phenomenon known as chloroplast movement. Observing chloroplast movement within leaf tissues remains technically challenging in leaves consisting of multiple cell layers, where light scattering and absorption hinder deep tissue visualization. This limitation has been particularly problematic when analyzing chloroplast movement in the mesophyll cells of C4 plants, which possess two distinct types of concentrically arranged photosynthetic cells. In response to stress stimuli, mesophyll chloroplasts aggregate toward the inner bundle sheath cells. However, conventional methods have not been able to observe these chloroplast dynamics over time in living cells, making it difficult to assess the influence of adjacent bundle sheath cells on this movement. Here, we present a protocol for live leaf section imaging that enables long-term and detailed observation of chloroplast movement in internal leaf tissues without chemical fixation. In this method, a leaf blade section prepared either using a vibratome or by hand was placed in a groove made of a silicone rubber sheet attached to a glass slide for microscopic observation. This technique allows for the quantitative tracking of chloroplast movement relative to the surrounding cells. In addition, by adjusting the sectioning angle and thickness of the unfixed leaf sections, it is possible to selectively inactivate specific cell types based on their size and shape differences. This protocol enables the investigation of the intercellular interactions involved in chloroplast dynamics in leaf tissues. Key features • Thin leaf sections prepared while still alive enable prolonged microscopic observation of chloroplast movement within the leaf tissue. • Selective cell inactivation can be achieved by adjusting the slice thickness and angle. • This method is applicable to a wide range of plant species.",

Infiltration of leaf segments using a syringe Air in the intercellular spaces in leaf tissue interferes with light transmission and hinders microscopic observation. To remove air, use a syringe to alternately apply mild vacuum and pressure around the leaf. 1. On a silicon rubber plate, cut the leaf blade using a razor blade into approximately 5 × 5 mm segments, avoiding the midrib. 2. Put 2–4 leaf segments and approximately 1 mL of purified water into the syringe. 3. Expel the air from the syringe by pushing the plunger. 4. Seal the syringe tip with a finger and slowly pull back the plunger to induce a low-pressure environment. While keeping the tip sealed, gradually return the plunger to its original position. 5. While keeping the tip sealed, push the plunger to induce a high-pressure environment in the syringe. 6. Repeat the push and pull movements of the plunger until water infiltrates the leaf tissue, causing the leaf segments to darken in color and sink into the water ( Video 1 ). Video 1. Infiltration of leaf segments using a syringe B1. Slicing the leaf segments using a vibratome Embedding the leaf segment in agar and slicing it with a vibratome allows for the stable and consistent production of uniformly thick sections. 1. Add 100 mL of purified water and 5 g of agar to a 300 mL flask, then dissolve it using a microwave. 2. Pour the melted agar solution into a small-diameter glass Petri dish and cool it in an ice bath while stirring with tweezers until the solution reaches a highly viscous state, immediately before solidification ( Video 2 ). Video 2. Inclusion of the leaf segment in an agar block 3. Insert one infiltrated leaf segment (5 × 5 mm) into the agar solution just before it solidifies, and then immediately place ice on top of the agar to accelerate cooling. 4. Once the agar is fully solidified, remove the dish from the ice bath and use the flat part of a spatula to lift the agar block out of the glass dish. 5. Trim the agar block with a razor blade, ensuring that the vascular bundle and the leaf plane are perpendicular to the bottom surface of the agar block ( Figure 1A , B). Note: If you want to observe a longitudinal section, you must align the vascular bundle horizontally with the bottom surface of the agar block. 6. Attach the agar block containing the leaf segment to the vibratome sample tray using instant adhesive and wait for at least 5 min to ensure complete solidification. 7. Set the tray to the vibratome ( Figure 1C ). 8. Fill the tray with water, set the desired thickness, and proceed with sectioning. Note: The optimal thickness setting varies depending on plant species and growth conditions. In our experience, setting the thickness to approximately twice the size of the individual cells in the cutting direction helps balance the risk of structural disintegration owing to excessive thinness and loss of visibility caused by excessive thickness. For transverse sections of finger millet, we consider 100 μm to be the optimal thickness. 9. Place the cut leaf section in a drop of water produced by surface tension on an inoculation loop or on the tip of tweezers that are not fully closed, and then carefully transfer it to a water-filled Petri dish. Figure 1. Slicing the leaf segment in the agar block using a vibratome. (A,B). Trimmed agar block containing leaf segments. The bottom surface of the agar block is perpendicular to the vascular bundles of the leaf (A) and the leaf plane (B). (C) Agar blocks glued to a tray in a vibratome. Note: In unfixed sections, partial cell cutting leads to the expulsion of intracellular contents owing to turgor pressure, rendering the cells non-functional. This phenomenon can be utilized for the selective deactivation of cells based on size and shape differences between the cell types ( Figure 2 ). In finger millet, the bundle sheath cells are thicker than the mesophyll cells in transverse sections ( Figure 2A , B). Therefore, it is possible to selectively remove the contents of bundle sheath cells by making longitudinal slices that are thinner than the bundle sheath cells but thicker than the mesophyll cells. At 60 μm thickness, both bundle sheath cells and adjacent mesophyll cells remain intact ( Figure 2C ). At 40 μm thickness, bundle sheath cells lose their contents, while adjacent mesophyll cells remain intact ( Figure 2D ). However, if the section does not include vascular bundles, bundle sheath cells are also not included ( Figure 2E ); therefore, the relationship between the two cells cannot be verified. Precise targeting of vascular bundles during cutting is nearly impossible; therefore, it is necessary to verify the presence of vascular bundles after slicing. Although microscopic observation is required for a precise selection, sections containing vascular bundles tend to be slightly firmer in structure and less prone to deformation, allowing for a simple preliminary selection. Figure 2. Selective removal of bundle sheath cells in C 4 plants by longitudinal sectioning. (A) Schematic diagram of the leaf blade of finger millet. A transverse section was made by cutting the leaf blade perpendicular to the vascular bundle (blue dashed line), and a longitudinal section was cut parallel to the vascular bundle (red dashed line). (B) Microscope image of a transverse section. Since bundle sheath cells are larger than mesophyll cells, it is possible to cut only bundle sheath cells while leaving mesophyll cells intact. (C–E) Longitudinal sections. (C) 60 μm-thick section with intact bundle sheath cells. (D) 40 μm-thick section without bundle sheath cell contents. (E) 60 μm-thick section, not including the vascular bundle, obtained by sectioning at 60 μm. Depending on the location of the slice, most of the cells in the section are partially broken off. M, mesophyll cell; BS, bundle sheath cell; V, vascular bundle. Scale bars,  100 μm. This figure is based on Figure 4 from Kato et al. (2025) [7] with modifications and additions. B2. Slicing the leaf segments by hand sectioning Using the vibratome method, soft leaves (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana ) tend to fall apart during sectioning, whereas hard leaves (e.g., Camellia japonica ) often detach from the agar. The hand-sectioning method overcomes these limitations by allowing sectioning regardless of leaf firmness. However, it should be noted that the thickness of the sections is not consistent. 1. Place the infiltrated leaf segment (5 × 5 mm) with approximately 1 mL of water on a translucent rubber plate and slice it into thin sections by pulling the blade while gently pressing the leaf with a finger ( Video 3 ). Video 3. Hand sectioning 2. Check the quality of the leaf sections on a rubber plate ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Appearance and microscopic images of hand sections from leaf blades of finger millet. (A) The slice thickness is greater than the leaf thickness. The cut surface does not face upward, and the leaf section is viewed from the epidermal side. (B) The slice thickness is appropriate. The cut surface is facing upward, and the leaf section maintains the gentle curvature of the leaf itself. (C) The slice thickness is thinner than most of the leaf cells. Some parts of the leaf tissue have collapsed. Scale bars, 100 μm. 3. Place the cut leaf section in a drop of water produced by surface tension on an inoculation loop or on the tip of tweezers that are not fully closed, and then carefully transfer it to a water-filled Petri dish. Note: In hand-sectioning, the most critical step is not the cutting process itself but rather checking the quality of the leaf sections. To help assess the condition of the leaf sections, placing a white paper under a silicone rubber plate can brighten the background and improve visibility. If the visibility remains poor, using a light source such as a light table under the silicone rubber plate further increases the visibility. C. Preparation of the microscope slide for live leaf-section imaging Creating a frame with a silicone rubber sheet allows for stable, long-term observation by simply placing a cover glass that prevents water evaporation ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, the use of a transparent silicone rubber sheet enables light irradiation through the rubber sheet to reach the epidermal surface of the leaf. 1. Cut the rubber sheet slightly larger than the cover glass with a razor blade or a utility knife. Then, cut a narrow rectangular groove for placing the leaf section and a larger square buffer space to slow liquid movement when sealed with a cover glass ( Figure 4B ). 2. Wash the rubber sheet and a glass slide, then rinse them with purified water. While still wet, place the rubber sheet at the center of the glass slide. 3. Wipe off excess water protruding from the rubber sheet with a paper wiper and allow the glass slide to dry at room temperature for at least 1 h. Note: If drying is insufficient, the mounting liquid may seep between the glass slide and the rubber sheet, causing the sheet to lift. Ideally, a rubber sheet should be placed and left to dry the day before mounting. 4. Pour a thin layer of 0.1% agar solution into the groove created in the silicone rubber sheet, then carefully transfer the leaf section into the groove using an inoculation loop or tweezers ( Video 4 ).

This figure is based on a part of Supplementary Figure S1 from Kato et al. (2025) [7] with modifications and additions. 5. Adjust the orientation and alignment of the leaf section by gently pressing its edges with the tip of the tweezers. 6. Seal the sample with a cover glass. Note: If the leaf section protrudes from the groove when sealed with a cover glass, the liquid volume is too high. Adjust the amount of liquid and attempt sealing again. 7. Wipe off excess water protruding from the cover glass with a paper wiper. D. Microscopic observation under light irradiation to induce chloroplast movement 1. Place red filters after the microscope light and before the camera ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5. Schematic diagram of the live leaf-section imaging. Schematics and image of the optical path. Red filters are placed within the optical path of the microscope, after the light source and in front of the camera. Weak red light (less than 1 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 ) was used for observation. A red filter was placed over the light source. The red filter is installed in front of the camera in an empty fluorescence mirror unit of the microscope. This figure is based on part of Supplementary Figure S1 from Kato et al. (2025) [7] with modifications and additions. 2. Set the prepared microscope slide on the microscope and adjust the focus under dim red light. 3. Use the timelapse function of the camera software to capture images once per minute, continuing until the observation is complete. Note: It is recommended to observe under only a dim red light for at least 1 h to allow the leaf to stabilize. If this step is skipped, there is a high probability that the focal position will shift or that the XY position of the leaf section will fluctuate during chloroplast movement induction. See Troubleshooting problem 2. 4. Place a light panel in front of the microscope to illuminate the leaf section through the rubber sheet. Note: For finger millet, chloroplast movement can be induced and completed by irradiating the sample with 500 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 of blue light for 4 h from the adaxial side ( Video 5 ). The light intensity is measured by placing the light sensor at the same distance from the light source as the leaf section during observation. To properly control the light environment, observations should be conducted in a dark room. Video 5. Live leaf-section imaging for finger millet. A 100 μm-thick section of finger millet leaf blade was irradiated with blue light at an intensity of 500 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 from the adaxial side for 4 h, after which the blue light irradiation was stopped. E. Tracking chloroplast movement using Fiji 1. Launch Fiji (ImageJ). 2. Go to File → Import → Image Sequence . 3. Select the folder containing the time-lapse images and click Open . 4. Open an image that contains a known scale bar. 5. Select the Line Tool from the toolbar and draw a line along the reference scale. 6. Go to Analyze → Set Scale . 7. In the Set Scale window, enter the known distance in the Known distance field. 8. Go to Plugins → Tracking → Manual Tracking . 9. In the Manual Tracking window, set Time Interval to 1 min. 10. Click Add Track and manually click on the first chloroplast to start tracking. Continue clicking on the same chloroplast in each subsequent frame to track its movement over time. Note: Chloroplasts also move along the Z-axis, which may cause them to move out of focus. Therefore, not all chloroplasts are continuously tracked throughout the observation period. 11. Repeat for other chloroplasts. 12. After tracking is complete, click End Track . 13. Save the result data by clicking File → Save As ... and choose CSV format for further analysis in Excel or R. 14. (Optional) To visualize movement trajectories, use Plot Track in the Manual Tracking tool ( Figure 6A ). Note: Using the coordinates of each chloroplast and the coordinates of the edges of the adjacent cell, the variation in the distance of the chloroplast from the neighboring cell can be calculated ( Figure 6B , C). The linear distance from the bundle sheath (BS) cell in Figure 6C was calculated using the coordinates of each chloroplast at each time point (x 0 , y 0 ), and the coordinates of the two endpoints (x 1 , y 1 ) and (x 2 , y 2 ) of the interface between the mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, all obtained using ImageJ. The formula is shown below. L i n e a r d i s t a n c e f r o m B S c e l l = y 2 - y 1 x 0 - x 2 - x 1 y 0 + x 2 y 1 - y 2 x 1 y 2 - y 1 2 + x 2 - x 1 2 Figure 6. Tracking chloroplast. (A) Images of adaxial mesophyll cells at the start of observation (-0.5 h) and 4 h after irradiation. A dot indicates the chloroplast position at each observation time, and chloroplast movement up to that time is indicated by a line. The shortest distance between the center of the chloroplast and the tangent to the bundle sheath cell is the \"linear distance from BS cell.\" (B) Schematic diagram showing changes in mesophyll chloroplast position. (C) Temporal changes in linear distance from bundle sheath cells in each chloroplast at each time were plotted at 1 min intervals from 0.5 before to 4 h after blue light irradiation treatment. If the chloroplasts could not be tracked because they overlapped or turned out of focus, tracking was terminated at that point. Red lines represent chloroplasts that moved closer to the bundle sheath cells, and the blue line represents those that moved farther from the bundle sheath cells after 4 h of blue light irradiation, compared to their initial position at the initial stage of irradiation (t  =  0). The line colors were determined based on the tracking endpoint for chloroplasts that could not be tracked for 4 h after initiation of the blue light irradiation treatment. More than 10 chloroplasts were randomly selected for monitoring from the adaxial side of leaf sections taken from three plants (chloroplast number  =  39). M: mesophyll cell; BS: bundle sheath cell. Scale bars, 25 μm. This figure is based on Figure 2 and a part of Figure 3 from Kato et al. (2025) [7] with modifications and additions.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research articles: Kato et al. [7]. Bundle sheath cell-dependent chloroplast movement in mesophyll cells of C 4 plants analyzed using live leaf-section imaging. Scientific Reports ( Figure 2B , Figure 3B –D, Figure 5C , Supplementary Figure S2B and S2C, Supplementary Figure S3B, Supplementary Figure S4B, and Supplementary Figure S5B and S2C) To minimize the influence of light other than the blue light used to induce chloroplast movement, red filters were used in Kato et al. [7]. However, the red filters are not essential. In Arabidopsis thaliana , avoidance movement and recovery were observed under blue light irradiation from the adaxial side even without a red filter ( Video 6 ). If a red filter is not used, full-color imaging can be performed. Video 6. Live leaf-section imaging without red light filters for Arabidopsis thaliana . A hand section of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf was irradiated with 500 μmol m -2 ·s -1 of blue light from the adaxial side for 2 h, after which blue light irradiation was stopped.",

    "abstract": "This protocol provides comprehensive guidance for researchers, including those with limited electron microscopy (EM) experience, on the effective use of genetically encoded, multichannel EMcapsulin reporters in both fluorescence microscopy and EM workflows. EMcapsulins are a set of modular gene reporters that manifest as distinct shapes in EM when expressed in cell culture or model organisms. This protocol encompasses detailed instructions for labeling cells or proteins of interest with fluorescent EMcapsulins, along with biochemical quality control measures. Researchers may also adapt the protocol to develop custom EMcapsulin constructs tailored to their specific experimental requirements.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Gene Synthesis, Mutagenesis, and Screening A gene encoding LOV2 domain of Phototropin 2 with codons optimized for E. coli was synthesized by overlap extension PCR [48] . Genetic libraries were constructed by saturation and random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling [21] . Mutants were fused to IFP1.4 by overlap extension PCR and cloned into a modified pBAD vector containing the heme oxygenase-1 gene from cyanobacteria [21] . Libraries were expressed in E. coli strain TOP10 and screened by imaging the agar plates with colonies in the IFP channel before and after blue light illumination [21] . Protein purification and spectroscopic characterization experiments were done as described [49] . Chimera Construction DNA encoding miniSOG with codons optimized for mammals was synthesized by overlap extension PCR [48] . MiniSOG fusions were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected with miniSOG or chimera cDNAs using Fugene, then imaged 24–48 h later. Cultured cortical neurons were transfected by Amaxa electroporation (Lonza AG, Germany) and imaged 1–2 wk later. Fluorescence Imaging, Photooxidation, and EM Preparation of Transfected Cultured Cells Transfected cells cultured on glass bottom culture dishes (P35G-0-14-C, MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) in pH 7.4 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) for 30–60 min, rinsed several times in chilled buffer, and treated for 30 min in blocking buffer (50 mM glycine, 10 mM KCN, and 5 mM aminotriazole) to reduce nonspecific background reaction of diaminobenzidine (DAB). Confocal images were taken with minimum exposure using a BioRad MRC-1024 inverted confocal microscope or similar inverted fluorescence microscope to identify transfected cells and for correlative light microscopic imaging. Detailed protocols for performing fluorescence photooxidation of DAB have been published [2] , [6] . It is important to use an inverted microscope to ensure direct open access to the DAB solution. An objective of numerical aperture ≥0.7 is desirable to maximize illumination intensity. For photooxidation, diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was freshly diluted to 1 mg/ml in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, filtered through a 0.22 micron syringe filter (Millipore), and placed on ice and added to the cells. The region of interest was identified by the fluorescence and an image recorded with care not to bleach the area. A small tube attached to an oxygen tank was placed near the top of the dish and a stream of pure oxygen was gently blown continuously over the top of the solution. Alternately, the DAB solution on ice was bubbled with oxygen and the solution in the dish refreshed every few minutes. The samples were then illuminated using a standard FITC filter set (EX470/40, DM510, BA520) with intense light from a 150W xenon lamp. Illumination was stopped as soon as a very light brown reaction product began to appear in place of the green fluorescence as monitored by transmitted light (typically 2–10 min, depending on the initial fluorescence intensity, the brightness of the illumination, and the optics used). Care was taken to avoid overreacting the samples, as this can lead to overstaining and the degradation of ultrastructure in the region of photooxidation. Multiple areas on a single dish could be reacted if the solution was refreshed every few minutes. The cells were then removed from the microscope and washed in chilled buffer (5×2 min) and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed in chilled buffer twice and rinsed in distilled water, then en bloc stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc.) for 1 h to overnight at 4°C. The samples were then dehydrated in a cold graded ethanol series (20%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, 100%) 2 min each, rinsed once in room temperature anhydrous ethanol, and infiltrated in Durcupan ACM resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using 1∶1 anhydrous ethanol and resin for 30 min, then 100% resin 2×1 h, then into fresh resin and polymerized in a vacuum oven at 60°C for 48 h. Preparation of C. elegans Transgenic worms were made by injection of cDNAs of mitochondrially targeted miniSOG driven by myo-3 promoter at 50 ng/µl. The worms were chemically fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, washed, and blocked as described above. The cuticle was sharply cut to allow diffusion of DAB into the inner body for photooxidation. After confocal imaging and fluorescence photooxidation, the worms were processed for EM imaging as described above. Preparation, Fluorescence Imaging, and Photooxidation of Mouse Brain Endotoxin-free DNA (∼3 µg) of the SynCAM2-miniSOG fusion construct was delivered into the lateral ventricle of embryos by in utero electroporation [50] . The offspring at p7 or p21 were anesthetized and fixed by vascular perfusion as previously described [51] with Ringer's solution followed by 4% formaldehyde made fresh from paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer. Brains were removed and placed in the same fixative at 4°C for 1 h for p21 and overnight for p7. In this case we avoided glutaraldehyde in combination with paraformaldehyde due to the increased autofluorescence that occurs with glutaraldehyde. The autofluorescence obscured miniSOG fluorescence and made it impossible to locate transfected neurons in the brain slices for photooxidation. Brains were then sliced to 100 µm sections using a vibratome (Leica). Areas of interest were identified by confocal microscopy. The sections were then postfixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, rinsed in cold buffer, blocked, and then photooxidized as described above. Subsequent procedures for EM processing were similar to those described above except the vibratome sections were resin embedded between two liquid release agent coated glass slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Electron Microscopy Photooxidized areas of embedded cultured cells were identified by transmitted light and the areas of interest were sawed out using a jeweler's saw and mounted on dummy acrylic blocks with cyanoacrylic adhesive. The coverslip was carefully removed, ultrathin sections were cut using an ultramicrotome, and electron micrographs recorded using a 1200 TEM (JEOL) operating at 80 keV. For tissue sections, one of the glass coverslips was removed using a razorblade and the area of interest identified by transmitted light microscopy. The tissue was removed from the slide, mounted, sectioned, and imaged as above. For electron tomography, 0.5 micron thick sections of cells expressing photooxidized H2B-miniSOG were cut and imaged using a 4000 IVEM (JEOL) operated at 400 keV. Images were tilted and recorded every 2° from ±60° to −60°. The image stack was aligned and reconstructions were obtained using R-weighed back projection methods with the IMOD tomography package. For serial block face scanning electron microscopy, a 3View system (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA) mounted in a Quanta FEG scanning electron microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) was employed. Imaging was performed as previously described [37] . Individual image planes were hand segmented to outline the plasma membrane of the target neuron and denote labeled post-synaptic densities, then thresholded and projected using Amira (Visage Imaging, Germany).\n\nSupporting Information Figure S1 Degradation of ADPA by ReAsH, KillerRed, or Rose Bengal (RB) upon irradiation.

    "abstract": "Even though the survival and proliferation stages of cancer cells that have newly settled at a metastatic site are the rate-limiting stages and the most promising targets for drugs, there is a lack of models of the earliest stage of metastasis formation. A method for modeling breast cancer liver metastasis is described here: a stage of transition of a differentiated tumor cell into a cell actively proliferating in a three-dimensional (3D) liver spheroid. Opposite to existing heterocellular 3D models of metastases, the protocol allows modeling the initial stage of liver colonization by metastatic cells, the so-called \"micrometastases.\" The method includes obtaining a line of fluorescent tumor cells, fluorescence-activated sorting of differentiated cells, preparing a single-cell suspension of liver cells, forming a liver spheroid in an agarose mold, inducing the tumor cell dedifferentiation and proliferation using IL-6, and intravital microscopy of spheroids, with subsequent processing and analysis of fluorescent images in the ImageJ software. The performance of the proposed model was demonstrated using microRNA therapeutics. The ability of a combination of microRNAs to suppress the transition of micrometastasis to macrometastasis in the 3D liver spheroid was confirmed by an immunofluorescent assay of spheroid sections and transcriptome analysis. Key features • The method introduces a 3D model of liver micrometastasis formation using differentiated tumor cells. • The 3D spheroid consists of all the main types of normal liver cells and better reproduces the microenvironment. • The method allows one to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug that blocks the transition of micrometastases to macrometastases. • The model is optimal for studying RNA-based therapeutic agents, as well as prodrugs that require metabolism in the liver for activation.",

Mixture of miRNAs miRNA mimics were prepared using a protocol described in [9]. The RNA oligonucleotide sequences are provided in Table S1. Three miRNA mimics (miR-195-5p, miR-520a, and miR-630) in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM Na 2 EDTA·2H 2 O were mixed at equimolar concentrations at a final concentration of each miRNA of 50 nM. For testing, the microRNA mixture and Metafectene PRO were mixed in a 5:1 ratio according to the manufacturer's protocol and transferred dropwise to spheroids in individual wells of a 12-well plate.

Cell culture T47D and THP-1 cells were cultured in the complete RPMI 1640; HepG2 and 293T cells were cultured in the complete DMEM/F12 medium; both complete media were supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× GlutaMAX, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution. All cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. Before experiments, thawed cells were cultured until passage 3. To remove cells from a plastic surface (unless specified otherwise), use the following protocol: remove the medium, wash with PBS, add TrypLE, and place the flask in the CO 2 incubator for 3–7 min of incubation. When the cell monolayer begins to separate from the plastic surface, add a complete growth medium (a volume equivalent to the volume of TrypLE) for neutralization, collect the cells into a centrifuge tube, and pellet them by centrifugation at 180× g for 5 min; then, resuspend the cells in the medium. B. Obtaining a genetically modified T47D_Red cell line expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) To obtain the genetically modified breast cancer cell line expressing RFP, the lentivirus transduction method is used. Below is a protocol for generating a T47D_Red cell line expressing RFP. The protocol involves transfection of 293T cells with a plasmid mixture for lentivirus production, infection of T47D cells, and obtaining a monoclonal cell line from a polyclonal pool of stably transfected cells by limiting dilution. This protocol can be successfully applied to other cell lines with any third-generation lentiviral plasmid encoding a fluorescent protein. Day 0 1. Seed 293T cells in wells of a 6-well plate precoated with poly-L-lysine at 0.6 × 10 6 cells/well in 2 mL of the complete DMEM/F-12 medium. Day 1 Note: The complete DMEM/F12 medium, Metafectene, and PBS must be at room temperature. 2. Check the confluence of the 293T cells; a confluence of ~80%–90% is recommended. 3. Before transfection, remove the medium, wash the wells with 1× PBS, and add 2 mL of fresh complete DMEM/F-12 medium containing no antibiotics to each well. 4. Perform transfection of 293T cells via Metafectene in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Place 43 μL of PBS in a 0.6 cm 3 microfuge tube, add 7 μL of Metafectene, and mix gently by pipetting. 5. In a separate tube, mix 1.25 μg of a third-generation lentiviral plasmid encoding a fluorescent protein (we used a plasmid encoding RFP expressed under the control of the EF-1α core promoter; Figure S1), 1 μg of packaging plasmid pMDLg/pRRE#54, 0.5 μg of packaging plasmid pRSV-Rev, and 0.75 μg of envelope plasmid pMD2.G. After that, adjust the volume with PBS to 50 μL. 6. Transfer the DNA plasmid mixture to the Metafectene-containing tube and mix gently once by pipetting. 7. Incubate the mix for 15 min at room temperature. 8. Add the transfection mixture into wells of the plate containing 293T cells dropwise, while gently swirling the plate. Note: Plasmids are not added to one well with cells, in which the untransfected 293T cells are used as a negative control. Day 2 9. At 16 h after transfection, replace the medium with the complete growth medium without antibiotics. Note: (optional) Twenty-four hours post-transfection, you can check transfection efficiency under a fluorescence microscope. 10. Harvest the lentiviral particles at 12-h intervals after a medium change. For this purpose, collect the medium into a 15 mL Falcon ® tube and add 2 mL of fresh complete growth medium into the well. Store lentiviral particles at 4 °C. 11. Seed the cells (0.4 × 10 6 of T47D cells per well of a 6-well plate) in complete growth medium RPMI 1640 without antibiotics so that they will reach 70%–80% confluence the next day. Day 3 12. Harvest the lentivirus two more times at 12-h intervals. 13. Centrifuge the tubes with freshly collected lentiviruses at 400× g for 7 min to pellet cell debris. 14. Collect the supernatant and pass it through 0.45-μm syringe filters. Note: (optional) After the final collection of the lentivirus-containing medium, detach transfected cells using TrypLE or Accutase and check transfection efficiency by flow-cytometric analysis. Day 4 15. In separate microfuge tubes, mix 1 mL of the lentivirus-containing medium (after filtration), 2 mL of the complete RPMI 1640 medium without antibiotics, and 2.4 μL of polybrene (to achieve a final concentration of 8 μg/mL), and transfer the entire contents of the tubes to the wells with T47D cells. 16. As a negative control, use T47D cells without the transduction mixture. 17. Place the multi-well plate in the CO 2 incubator at 37 °C. 18. Replace the medium after 24 h. 19. After another 24 h, assess the fluorescence level by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. Note: (optional): To establish a monoclonal cell line, the cells are dissociated from the plate, counted, diluted to a density of 10 cells/mL (it is recommended to make serial dilutions to minimize errors), and seeded in a 96-well plate in a volume of the medium of 100 μL (at ~1 cell per well). The next day, inspect the plate under a fluorescence microscope and mark the well that contains one fluorescent cell. Next, replace the medium every 3 days. After 90% confluence is reached, transfer the cells (monoclone) to a culture dish with a larger surface area, in accordance with the dilution recommended for a given cell line (e.g., 1:4 for T47D). When the number of cells is sufficient for analysis, check the expression level by flow cytometry. The histogram should show a single-phase distribution, and the proportion of fluorescent cells should be 90%. C. Preparation of a single-cell suspension of mouse liver cells 1. Anesthetize the mouse via inhalation of isoflurane. 2. Disinfect the surgical area with an alcohol disinfectant solution. 3. Dissect the skin and proper fascia of the abdominal wall along the white line of the abdomen and obtain access to the liver. 4. Remove the liver, place it in a Petri dish, and chop it with a scalpel. 5. Transfer the resulting homogenate to a 50-mL test tube. 6. Add 10 mL of type-II collagenase solution and incubate for 25 min on a rotator shaker at 37 °C. Note: It is recommended to find an optimal time for tissue dissociation in the collagenase solution beforehand in your laboratory. Typically, it varies from 20 to 60 min; the efficiency of tissue dissociation can be estimated by means of the density of the formed spheroids (Figure S2). 8. Bring the suspension volume to 30 mL with cold 1× PBS. 9. Grind the sample through a strainer with a 100-μm pore size. 10. Wash the strainer with 10 mL of 1× PBS. 11. Centrifuge at 323× g for 10 min. 12. Lyse erythrocytes with ACK buffer: add 2 mL of ACK buffer to the precipitate and incubate for 3 min, then add 30 mL of PBS, mix, and centrifuge at 323× g for 10 min. 13. Resuspend the resulting cell pellet in 1 mL of complete William’s medium and count the obtained cells. The resulting cells can be stored on ice for several hours. Proceed to Section E as quickly as possible. D. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of differentiated tumor cells 1. Detach T47D cells from a culture plastic surface using Accutase. Remove the medium, wash with PBS, add Accutase, and place the flask in the CO 2 incubator for 5–7 min. When the cell monolayer begins to detach from the plastic surface, add a complete growth medium (a volume equivalent to the volume of Accutase) for neutralization, collect the cells into a centrifuge tube, and pellet them by centrifugation at 180× g for 5 min. 2. Wash the cell pellet once in FACS buffer. 3. Stain with a fluorescently labeled antibody to CD44 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Note: An antibody with any fluorochrome compatible with your sorter and not coinciding with the fluorescence spectra of the fluorescent protein expressed by tumor cells can be chosen. 3. After staining, wash cells twice with 2 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 80× g for 10 min. 4. After the second wash, resuspend the cells in complete RPMI 1640 medium and place them on ice to maintain their viability. 5. Perform сell sorting to obtain a CD44– population, i.e., a population of differentiated cancer cells. Acquire flow cytometry data and display cells on an SSC-A (side scatter-area) vs. FSC-A (forward scatter-area) density plot. Set the initial gate (gate P1) to select the main population of intact single cells while excluding debris and cellular fragments. From the P1-gated population, generate an FSC-H (forward scatter-height) vs. FSC-A (forward scatter-area) plot. Apply a secondary gate (gate P2) to exclude cell doublets and aggregates by selecting the population displaying a linear relationship between FSC-H and FSC-A. Next, identify the population of RFP + CD44– cells based on their fluorescence intensities in the FITC and PE channels using single-stained controls to set up compensation and to determine positive-negative thresholds. 6. Fill the centrifuge tube for collecting the target population with complete RPMI 1640 medium to ensure cell viability. 7. After collection, centrifuge the cells, and resuspend the resultant pellet in 1 mL of complete William’s medium. The cells can be stored on ice for several hours. Proceed to Section E as quickly as possible. E. Obtaining 3D liver spheroids with micrometastases 1. To obtain the spheroids, prepare a cell suspension as follows: 150,000 mouse liver cells (from the single-cell suspension) and 10,000 CD44– T47D_Red cells in 190 μL of complete William’s medium per mold (to obtain 81 spheroids). The 81-spheroid mold provides adequate cell density for single-cell resolution in tumor cell tracking, while restricting spheroid diameter below the hypoxia threshold, thereby preventing central necrosis development. Additionally, this format enables robust statistical analysis by generating multiple biological replicates per experimental condition. Note: The number of molds and cells must be increased proportionally to the number of drugs tested. 2. Transfer the resulting suspension onto a mold made of 2% agarose in a 12-well plate. 3. Incubate for 60 min in a CO 2 incubator. 4. Add 1 mL of complete William’s medium into each well. 5. To induce dedifferentiation, introduce IL-6 to all wells (final concentration: 50 ng/mL). 6. To test the antimetastatic activity at this stage, it is necessary to add a tested compound to the wells with IL-6. The volume of the added solutions should not exceed 10% of the volume of the medium. As a control, it is necessary to employ cells in molds with added IL-6 and the solvent (vehicle) of the tested substances (without the substances themselves). The initial stage of spheroid formation can be observed as early as 1 h, and subsequent compaction occurs during further cultivation. 7. After 24 h, replace the medium with a fresh one. 8. At 96 h from the start of the incubation, replace half of the medium with fresh medium supplemented with a 2-fold concentration of IL-6 to maintain the dedifferentiation of tumor cells in the system under study. F. Evaluation of antimetastatic potential of the compounds being tested Under the influence of IL-6, differentiated cells undergo a process of dedifferentiation and acquire the ability to proliferate. Because tumor cells within the spheroid are fluorescent, the effectiveness of the antimetastatic compound can be assessed by intravital fluorescence microscopy of the spheroids: when cell proliferation is blocked successfully, there should be no increase in the area occupied by RFP + cells. G. Semiquantitative analysis of the viability of liver spheroids Assessment of cell viability in a spheroid is conveniently performed by an assay for the activity of intracellular esterases by means of a dye (Calcein AM). At this stage, it is possible to analyze the viability of all spheroids in a mold at the same time and of several spheroids extracted from the mold. G1. For an analysis of the viability of spheroids directly on the mold: 1. Carefully remove the medium from the mold. 2. Wash the mold twice with 200 μL of 1× PBS. 3. Add 200 μL of the working solution of Calcein AM (with a concentration of 2 μM). 4. Incubate this system for 30 min at 37 °C. 5. Carefully remove the solution and add 200 μL of complete William’s medium. 6. Incubate this system for 30 min at 37 °C. 7. Examine the samples under a fluorescence microscope. G2. In case of an analysis of individual spheroids: 1. Carefully remove them from a mold using a 1,000-μL pipette tip and transfer them to a 96-well flat-bottomed plate. 2. Wash the spheroids in the plate twice with PBS: add 200 μL of PBS and then carefully remove the liquid. 3. Add 100 μL of the working solution of Calcein AM (with a concentration of 2 μM). 4. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. 5. Carefully remove the solution and add 100 μL of complete William’s medium. 6. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. 7. Analyze the samples under a fluorescence microscope. Viable, metabolically active cells will emit green fluorescence. 8. Obtain images under the fluorescence microscope and perform an analysis in ImageJ with the SpheroidJ plugin. Note: To validate the proposed viability assay, liver spheroids were incubated with cyclophosphamide at concentrations of 0.04–1.00 mg/mL for 48 h (Figure S3). H. Analysis of marker expression by immunostaining To evaluate the repression or activation of certain genes, it is convenient to perform immunostaining of spheroids with appropriate antibodies. The frequency of this assay (on the day of analysis) should be selected in accordance with the objectives of a study. We recommend evaluating at least 10 spheroids in each experimental group. It is worthwhile to collect the material on the first day at the stage of spheroid formation. The advantage of our model is that the agarose mold itself can be cut into several parts with a scalpel after the formation of spheroids, thus enabling a time course analysis by means of only one mold. In our experiment, we assessed dedifferentiation under the influence of the tested drug via staining for stemness markers: staining with antibodies to CD24 and CD44. Analysis of the expression of these surface markers is most often chosen to evaluate the differentiation of tumor cells. 1. Remove the medium from the mold (or from a part of it), taking care not to aspirate any spheroid. 2. Fix the spheroids in 500 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. 3. Incubate for 1 h in 500 μL of 30% sucrose. 4. Carefully remove the liquid and place the spheroids in a cryo-mold, completely covered with the OCT matrix medium. Freeze in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. 5. On a cryotome, obtain 8 μm thick sections and place them on histological glass slides with an adhesive coating. Outline each section with a hydrophobic marker. 6. Wash the glass slides with sections three times in 1× PBS. 7. Perform blocking in 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h in a humidified chamber. 8. Stain with fluorescently labeled antibodies to CD44 and CD24 for 1 h in a humidified chamber in the dark (in our case, the working concentration of each antibody was 1:500 in PBS, added at 30 μL per section). 9. Wash with 1× PBS three times. 10. Apply an embedding medium (Fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI) and cover the sections with a coverslip. 11. Image spheroids under an inverted fluorescence microscope in transmitted light and in the DAPI/GFP/RFP/Cy5 channels at 40× magnification. I. Transcriptomic analysis RNA expression profiling is a powerful research approach that allows an investigator to comprehensively evaluate the effects of a drug on cells; this approach is especially important when gene therapy modalities are tested. 1. Collect all spheroids from molds by pipetting. We recommend collecting at least 1,620 spheroids (~100,000–200,000 T47D_Red cells) in each experimental tube for RNA isolation. 2. Wash the molds twice with 1× PBS to collect all cells. 3. Centrifuge the resultant cell suspension at 269× g for 10 min. Note: If long-term storage of the samples is planned, then RNAlater is added to the cell pellet at this stage, and the samples are stored at -20 °C. 4. Isolate the total RNA from cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit containing DNase I. 5. Assess the concentration and purity of the isolated RNA on a NanoDrop-2000 spectrophotometer. 6. Evaluate RNA integrity by capillary electrophoresis on a TapeStation instrument with the R6K ScreenTape kit. In our experiments, the concentration of RNA ranged from 15 to 150 ng/μL, the А 260 /А 280 ratio was 1.65–1.95, А 260 /А 230 was 1.80–1.95, and the RNA integrity number was 6.8–9.0. 6. Next, carry out an analysis involving microarrays designed for transcriptomic analysis of human genes on the Clariom TM S assay platform. At least three biological replicates are required for differential gene expression analysis.\n\nValidation of protocol Parts of this protocol have been used and validated in the following research article: Nevskaya et al. [26]. As a result of transduction of T47D cells with the lentiviruses, a polyclonal cell line is obtained that can already be subjected to research. In this way, for T47D cells, after transduction, we obtained a polyclone where there were 60% of RFP + cells (Figure S4). Considering that fluorescence-activated cell sorting with FITC-labeled antibodies is used to isolate the desired population of CD44– cells, at this stage, it is possible to sort out, for example, RFP + CD44– cells. Nevertheless, obtaining a monoclonal cell line with bright fluorescence may be more preferable and convenient for systematic investigation. Accordingly, we obtained a monoclone of T47D_Red cells stably expressing RFP, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (Figure S4). It should be noted that with our protocol, one can use any third-generation lentiviral plasmid encoding a fluorescent protein to obtain a fluorescent cell line. For example, we have previously successfully constructed the MDA-MB231_Green cell line stably expressing green fluorescent protein [27] using the pGpur plasmid (Figure S5). Using a primary culture of mouse liver cells to generate a spheroid is convenient because mouse liver cells are easy to obtain, unlike human liver cells. An additional advantage is that work with mouse liver cells enables an analysis of the transcriptome of tumor cells by means of human microarrays for transcriptome analysis, without the technically complicated additional step of separating a small number of human cancer cells from the bulk of the spheroid. The use of primary cell culture gives a more adequate micrometastasis model to assess the effect of a compound on the proliferation of cancer cells, as compared to when tumorous or immortalized liver cell lines are used. Nonetheless, our protocol helps to generate spheroids from any other cells, including established cell lines, and to incorporate additional cell types, such as fibroblasts or immune cells, into the spheroid. In Figure 9 , a heterocellular spheroid composed of HepG2, THP-1_Green, and T47D_Red cells is presented. Such heterocellular spheroids help to reproduce a complex multicellular system, which can be useful for drug screening. However, HepG2 is a cancerous cell line, and it should be used with caution for testing anticancer agents, taking into account the mechanism of action of the drug under investigation. Protocol adaptation may be required to suit specific experimental needs. Figure 9. A representative image of a heterocellular liver spheroid consisting of nonfluorescent HepG2 cells, GFP-expressing THP-1 cells (green), and RFP-expressing T47D cells (red) mixed in a 17:1:1 ratio, respectively. Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). The image was captured by means of a Nexcope NCF950 confocal laser scanning microscope (China). The literature describes examples of successful preparation of heterocellular 3D models of metastases, e.g., to bones [28,29] or to the liver [30]. In those studies, bone tissue cells and cancer cells (prostate, breast, or colon cancer) have been mixed with hepatocytes in various ratios, e.g., 1:1 [28], 9:1 [29], or 10:1 [30]. To model micrometastasis in the liver and to imitate colonization of the organ by metastatic cells, it is necessary to obtain “micrometastases” consisting of one or a few cells; therefore, in our model, the proportion of breast cancer cells in the spheroid was reduced to 17:1. The use of model cancer cells expressing a fluorescent protein allows a researcher to track their proliferation: the transition of micrometastasis to macrometastasis. An hour after coincubation of mouse liver cells (from a single-cell suspension) and a CD44– population of human tumorous T47D_Red cells, the initial stage of formation of a spheroid was observed; within it, stand-alone tumor cells were identified ( Figure 10 ). The introduction of IL-6 into the wells triggered a dedifferentiation process [31] and active proliferation of the tumor cells during the first 2 days. The observed increase in the area of tumor foci ( Figure 10B , C) imitates the formation of macrometastasis. It must be pointed out that without the induction by IL-6, the cells almost did not proliferate ( Figure 10B ). Thus, we successfully modeled in vitro the transition of breast cancer micrometastasis to macrometastasis in the liver. According to the staining with Calcein AM, the formed liver spheroid maintains its viability at a constant level for at least 7 days. Figure 10. Assay of the efficacy of miRNAs in the model of breast cancer micrometastasis within a three-dimensional (3D) liver spheroid. (A) Representative images of spheroids formed from a single-cell suspension of mouse liver cells and CD44– (differentiated) human breast cancer cells (T47D_Red cells stably expressing RFP) after 1 h of incubation or (B) 1, 2, 3, 6, or 7 days of incubation without dedifferentiation (Control), after induction of dedifferentiation with IL-6 (+IL-6), or after IL-6–induced dedifferentiation and addition of a mixture of miRNAs (+IL-6+miRNAs). (C) A change in the percentage of area occupied by T47D_Red tumor cells in the liver spheroid during incubation for 7 days. Data are presented as mean ± SD. To determine the applicability of our model to the testing of antimetastatic drugs, we employed a mixture of miRNAs (miR-195-5p, miR-520a, and miR-630) blocking the dedifferentiation of a differentiated cancer cell. For this purpose, IL-6 and a mixture of miRNAs were added to experimental wells containing spheroids at the stage of dedifferentiation induction to block dedifferentiation and to prevent the transition of the micrometastasis to macrometastasis. It was found that there was no increase in the area of tumor foci in liver spheroids when the mixture of miRNAs was added ( Figure 10C ). The reproducibility of the protocol, namely the ability of the miRNAs mixture to prevent tumor cell proliferation within the three-dimensional liver spheroid, was confirmed in two independent experiments. Both at the development stage and at the stage of evaluation of the efficiency of drug batches, it is important to confirm the mechanism of biological action. For gene therapy modalities, the development of such rapid assays is in demand [32]. Examination of spheroids by an immunofluorescence assay involving specific antibodies allowed us to analyze the expression of stem cell markers in order to confirm the targeted effect of miRNAs on the cancer cells within the spheroid. One hour after coincubation of a single-cell suspension of mouse liver cells and CD44– T47D_Red cells (the initial stage of spheroid formation), stand-alone differentiated tumor cells with the RFP + CD44–CD24 + phenotype were detectable within the spheroid ( Figure 11 ). Figure 11. Representative images of a spheroid at the formation stage at 1 h after coincubation of mouse liver cells and differentiated (CD44–) T47D_Red tumor cells. Cancer T47D_Red cells are red, CD44 + cells are green, CD24 + cells are magenta, and nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). By day 4 of the experiment, in spheroids after the IL-6–induced dedifferentiation, stand-alone tumor cells with the RFP + CD44 + CD24 + phenotype (progenitor cells) or RFP + CD44 + CD24– phenotype (stem cells) were observed, as were foci consisting of several tumor cells having the RFP + CD44 + CD24 + phenotype ( Figure 12A ). In the spheroids incubated with IL-6 and the mixture of miRNAs, only a few RFP + CD44 + CD24 + cells and RFP + CD44–CD24 + (differentiated) cells were noted within the spheroid ( Figure 12B ). Figure 12. Representative images of the spheroid on the fourth day of the experiment. (A) The control (induction by IL-6) and (B) experiment (induction by IL-6 and treatment with the mixture of miRNAs). Cancer T47D_Red cells are red, CD44 + cells are green, CD24 + cells are magenta, and nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). By the seventh day of the experiment, foci of clusters of CD44 + CD24 –/low stem cells were detectable in spheroids of the control group (without miRNAs) ( Figure 13A ). Within the spheroids after exposure to the mixture of miRNAs, predominantly differentiated CD44–CD24– cells and only a few CD44–CD24 + cells were found. Progenitor and stem tumor cells were absent ( Figure 13B ). Figure 13. Representative images of the spheroid on the seventh day of the experiment. (A) The control (induction by IL-6) and (B) experiment (induction by IL-6 and treatment with the mixture of miRNAs). Cancer T47D_Red cells are red, CD44 + cells are green, CD24 + cells are magenta, and nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). Thus, treatment of the spheroid with the mixture of miRNAs in the model of IL-6–induced dedifferentiation helps tumor cells to retain the differentiated phenotype and prevents their proliferation and thus the transition of micrometastasis to macrometastasis. Suppression of genes responsible for the induction and maintenance of stemness of tumor cells by means of the miRNAs in the model of IL-6–induced dedifferentiation in liver spheroids was confirmed by the results of a transcriptomic analysis ( Figure 14 ). Figure 14. Transcriptomic analysis of human breast cancer T47D_Red cells in the model of IL-6–induced dedifferentiation within 3D liver spheroids under the influence of the mixture of miRNAs on days 4 and 7 of incubation. (A) Volcano plot of gene expression in tumor cells in group “miRNAs” vs. group “Control” on the fourth day and (B) on the seventh day. (C) Heat map of differential expression of stemness genes on the fourth day and (D) on the seventh day (group “miRNAs” vs. “Control”). (E) Heat map of differential expression of stemness genes in group “miRNAs on the fourth day” vs. group “miRNAs on the seventh day.” Relative to the control, on day 4, miRNAs statistically significantly (p-value < 0.05, false discovery rate–adjusted p-value < 0.05) suppressed 1,484 genes and activated 153 genes. On day 7, the expression of 1,377 genes proved to be reduced, and the expression of 217 genes was found to be enhanced ( Figure 14A , B). A separate analysis of stemness genes’ expression (the suppression of which underlies the inhibition of tumor cell dedifferentiation by means of the miRNAs) revealed that on day 4 of the incubation, among the 50 stemness genes assessed, 28 genes were statistically significantly inhibited by the miRNAs, and only six genes were activated ( Figure 14C ). The suppressive effect of the miRNAs on the stemness genes persisted on day 7; the expression of 22 stemness genes was found to be reduced, and the expression of seven genes proved to be increased ( Figure 14D ). Among differentially expressed stemness genes, on the seventh day, the inhibitory effect of the miRNAs was still present for 11 stemness genes, and another 11 stemness genes were additionally inhibited; only for four genes, the inhibition switched to activation, while the stemness genes expressed on the fourth day were inactive. If we compare expression levels of the stemness genes under the action of the miRNAs on the fourth and seventh days combined, we can see that the number of suppressed stemness genes is greater than the number of activated ones (19 vs. 12). This observation indicates the persistence and enhancement of miRNAs’ effects over time ( Figure 14E ). Thus, according to the transcriptomic analysis, these miRNAs inhibit stemness genes for a long time, thereby preventing the dedifferentiation of tumor cells into stem tumor cells.\n\nSupplementary information The following supporting information can be downloaded here : 1.

    "title": "Proximity Labelling to Quantify Kv7.4 and Dynein Protein Interaction in Freshly Isolated Rat Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.",
    "abstract": "Understanding protein-protein interactions is crucial for unravelling subcellular protein distribution, contributing to our understanding of cellular organisation. Moreover, interaction studies can reveal insights into the mechanisms that cover protein trafficking within cells. Although various techniques such as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence microscopy are commonly employed to detect protein interactions, their limitations have led to more advanced techniques such as the in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) for spatial co-localisation analysis. The PLA technique, specifically employed in fixed cells and tissues, utilises species-specific secondary PLA probes linked to DNA oligonucleotides. When proteins are within 40 nm of each other, the DNA oligonucleotides on the probes interact, facilitating circular DNA formation through ligation. Rolling-circle amplification then produces DNA circles linked to the PLA probe. Fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides hybridise to the circles, generating detectable signals for precise co-localisation analysis. We employed PLA to examine the co-localisation of dynein with the Kv7.4 channel protein in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells from rat mesenteric arteries. This method enabled us to investigate whether Kv7.4 channels interact with dynein, thereby providing evidence of their retrograde transport by the microtubule network. Our findings illustrate that PLA is a valuable tool for studying potential novel protein interactions with dynein, and the quantifiable approach offers insights into whether these interactions are changed in disease.",

Prepare the HEPES-Krebs solution (see Recipes) Take the enzymes out of the -20 °C freezer and thaw at room temperature. Isolation of the rat mesenteric arteries Sacrifice the rat (in accordance with annex IV of the EU Directive 2010/63EU\non the protection of animals used for scientific purposes). Make the rat unconscious by a single percussive blow to the head.\nImmediately after the onset of unconsciousness, perform cervical\ndislocation to complete the killing. Perform a laparotomy using surgical scissors and elevate the intestines out\nof the abdominal cavity ( Figure 2A –2D). Figure 2. Dissection process of rat mesenteric arteries. A. The male Wistar rat is euthanised via cervical dislocation.\nB–D. A laparotomy is performed, and the rat intestines are\nisolated. E. The intestines are pinned onto a dissection dish\nusing sewing pins to expose the mesenteric vessels. F–H.\nThe main mesenteric artery and vein, surrounded by adipose\ntissue, are visualised. I–K. The surrounding tissue is\nremoved, and 3–4 branches of the mesenteric arteries are\nisolated for the extraction of arterial smooth muscle cells. Cut the intestines just above the rectum and below the stomach and place the\nintestines in a beaker filled with HEPES-Krebs placed on ice ( Figure 2A –2D). Place the intestines into a dissection dish filled with cold HEPES-Krebs\nbuffer and pin the jejunum and ileum along the side of the dissection dish\nforming a circle, allowing visualisation of the mesenteric vessels, with the\nmain arterial branch in the centre ( Figure 2E ). Place the dish under a 10× dissecting microscope for visualisation of\nthe arteries and veins ( Figure\n2F –2G). Arteries can be differentiated from veins by their thicker smooth\nmuscle layer, which makes them more rigid compared to veins.\nFurthermore, the thicker wall creates the appearance of a reduced\nblood volume compared to veins. Remove all tissue surrounding the arteries ( Figure 2G –2H). Begin by locating the larger veins and carefully tear them using two\nforceps; then, remove them all the way down to the lower-order\nbranches. Cut through the mesentery connecting the arterial branches and remove\nall adipose tissue surrounding the arteries. Remove the mesenteric arteries by first cutting at the lower-order branches\nand then free the mesenteric arteries by cutting the central branch ( Figure 2I –2K). Take a small section of the main artery, including 3–4 branches of\nlower-order mesenteric arteries and place it in a 1.5 mL tube filled with\nSMDS solution on ice. Remove the remaining intestines from the dissection dish for disposal. Isolation of the mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells Have a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette ready. To make a fire-polished\npipette, break off the long end of the pipette and throw it out. Expose the\npipette with its broken end to a Bunsen flame, constantly rotating it.\nContinue with this process until the edges are polished and the opening is\nsmoothed and narrowed to an inner diameter of roughly 0.7–1 mm ( Figure 1 ). Wash\nthe pipette with ethanol after each experiment so it can be used for\nsubsequent future experiments. The following solutions used for smooth muscle cell isolation have been\nadapted from Zhong et al. [14] and Chadha et al. [11]. Prepare the following\nstock solutions (Recipes 7–9) by dissolving them in SMDS solution\n(Recipe 5) in 1.5 mL tubes and keep them at room temperature. These stock solutions have to be prepared fresh on the day of the\nexperiment and cannot be stored for future experiments. Place the tube with the mesenteric artery branch in SMDS solution in a 37\n°C heat block for 10 min to equilibrate the arteries at 37 °C. In the meantime, prepare Tube 1 (Recipe 8) by combining the stock solutions\n(Recipe 7) and SMDS solution in a 1.5 mL tube. Transfer the mesenteric arteries to Tube 1. Gently invert the tube 4–5\ntimes to ensure proper mixing of the arteries with the solution and incubate\nat 37 °C for 10 min. In the meantime, prepare Tube 2 (Recipe 9) by combining the stock solutions\n(Recipe 7) and SMDS solution in a 1.5 mL tube. Take the arteries from the heat block and wash five times in ice-cold SMDS\nsolution using a glass Pasteur pipette with a rubber bulb. Transfer the mesenteric arteries to Tube 2. Gently invert the tube 4–5\ntimes to mix the arteries with the solution, and incubate at 37 °C for\n10 min. The arterial branch may appear slightly blurry or fluffy during this\nstep; this means that the enzymatic digestion is effectively\nisolating the cells. Gently wash five times in ice-cold SMDS solution using a glass Pasteur\npipette with a rubber cap. During the last wash, replace the solution with\n500 μL of SMDS. Liberate the myocytes by gently triturating the arterial branch using the\ncustom-made fire-polished glass pipette. Perform approximately 30 up-and-down triturations. Store the supernatant containing liberated myocytes in a separate tube on ice\nand add 500 μL of fresh SMDS to the arterial branch in the tube. Place a\ndroplet of the supernatant on a glass slide and assess the cell density\nusing a 10× microscope. Repeat the trituration process and save the supernatant in separate tubes on\nice, until no more cells are released within the supernatant. This process can take approximately 1–5 rounds of trituration. Note: Consider shortening the artery incubation time\n(1–3 min shorter) with enzymes in tube 1 and tube 2, if\nthe enzymes are newly opened, to prevent over-digestion of the\narteries and enhance myocyte liberation. Combine the supernatants that have liberated myocytes and adjust the\nconcentration of cells by adding more SMDS to achieve the desired cell\ndensity. By placing 50 µL of the cells on a glass coverslip, it is\npossible to check the cell density under a light microscope. There is no\ndefined cell density necessary for undertaking this protocol, but smooth\nmuscle cells should be visible under a light microscope’s 20×\nobjective, and the cells should not be crowded and touching one another. Add 1 μL of 100 mM calcium chloride for every 1 mL of cell suspension\n(resulting in a final concentration of 100 μM calcium chloride). Calcium\nis required for the cells to adhere to the coverslips. Note: Consider increasing the calcium chloride concentration by\n10%–20% if there is significant loss of cells from the coverslip\nafter fixing the cells. Add 100 μL of cell suspension on a 12 mm coverslip in a 24-well plate and\nkeep at room temperature for 30 min to let the cells adhere to the\ncoverslips ( Figure 3A ). After 30 min, the cells can be incubated with a pharmacological\nagent. To do this, dissolve the compound at the desired\nconcentration in SMDS solution supplemented with 100 μM calcium\nchloride, replace the solution on the coverslip with 100 μL of\ncompound solution, and incubate at 37 °C. Figure 3. Adhesion and primary antibody incubation for isolated\nvascular smooth muscle cells. A. Place 100 µL of cell suspension onto each coverslip in\nthe well. B. Create a humidified chamber using a Styrofoam\nicebox and parafilm. C. Incubate the cells with the primary\nantibody by applying a drop of the diluted antibody on the\nparafilm and placing the coverslip with adhered cells on top. D.\nSeal the humidified chamber with cling film for incubation at 4\n°C. Fix the cells by gently aspirating the SMDS solution from the coverslip and\napply 400 μL of 4% PFA to each well. Place the 24-wells on the rocker for\n15 min at room temperature. Wash three times with PBS, 400 μL per well. Use the coverslips immediately for PLA experiment or store coverslips in the\n24-wells plate (with each well containing 1 mL of PBS and sealed with\nparafilm) at 4 °C for up to four weeks until used for the PLA\nexperiment. The duration of storage depends on the specific cell type. Part II: PLA Preparation Allow the PLA wash buffers A and B to reach room temperature prior to\nuse, as cold wash buffers can lead to nonspecific background signal. Permeabilization, blocking, and primary antibody incubation Prepare a sufficient volume of 0.1% Triton-X in PBS to add 400 μL\nof the solution to each coverslip within the well. Add 400 μL of 0.1% Triton-X to each well, place on the rocker, and\nincubate for 5 min to permeabilise the cells. Wash two times for 5 min each in PBS. Remove the PBS and apply three drops of the blocking buffer (provided\nin the PLA probe kit) onto the cells on the coverslip in each well.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Prepare the primary antibody mix. It is very important that the two\nprimary antibodies targeting the protein of interest are raised in\ndifferent species. In our experiment, to look at Kv7.4 and dynein\nco-localisation, we prepared a primary antibody mixture\nconsisting of anti-dynein and anti-Kv7.4 antibodies. Dilute the primary antibodies in the antibody diluent provided in the\nPLA probe kit, following the specific requirements of each antibody. Prepare enough to use 40 μL of the primary antibody mix\nfor each coverslip. Create a humidified chamber ( Figure 3B ). Use the lid of a Styrofoam ice box; the lid must have a\nrecessed area in the middle. Place a piece of parafilm in the centre of the lid, where the\ncoverslips will be placed for incubation. Create four wells using parafilm, each well containing a wet\ntissue inside (see Figure 3B ). Place\nthe four wet tissues in parafilm wells around the flat piece\nof parafilm in the middle of the Styrofoam lid. This will\nhelp maintain moisture and prevent the coverslips from\ndrying out during the overnight incubation with the primary\nantibodies. Add a 40 μL drop of primary antibody mix to the parafilm. Using forceps, lift the coverslip from the blocking solution,\nremoving it from the well. Gently tap the side of the coverslip on a\npaper tissue to remove excess blocking buffer and place it over the\nantibody drop with the side containing cells making contact with the\ndrop and facing downward ( Figure 3C ). Cover the Styrofoam lid with cling film and leave it overnight at 4\n°C ( Figure\n3D ). Note: This primary antibody concentration and incubation\ntime may require optimisation. Probe incubation Note: Each coverslip represents one reaction, and 40 µL of\nsolution is used per reaction. The calculations provided in the\nfollowing steps are for a single reaction. The following day, take the PLA PLUS and MINUS probe out of the\nfridge and vortex. Prepare the PLA probe mix by diluting the PLA PLUS and MINUS probes\n1:5 in the antibody diluent provided in the kit. Make sufficient PLA\nprobe solution to use 40 μL per coverslip. For one coverslip (40 μL): dilute 8 μL of PLUS and 8\nμL of MINUS in 24 μL of antibody diluent. Place the coverslips incubated with the primary antibodies back in\nthe 24-well plate and wash two times for 5 min each in PLA wash\nbuffer A at room temperature on a rocker. Place a new piece of parafilm in the handcrafted humidified chamber\nand add 40 μL drops of PLA probe mix for every coverslip. Add the coverslips on top of the droplets with the side containing\ncells facing downward. Place the humidified chamber in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h. Ligation Place the coverslips back in the 24-well plate and wash two times for\n5 min each in PLA wash buffer A at room temperature on a rocker. Prepare the PLA ligation mix by diluting the 5× ligation buffer\nwith Milli-Q water (1:5 dilution) and add the ligase (1:40 dilution)\nto the mix. For one coverslip (40 μL): dilute 7.8 μL of 5×\nligation buffer in 31.2 μL of Milli-Q water and 1 μL\nof ligase. Wait to add the ligase until immediately prior to incubation. Place a new piece of parafilm in the handcrafted humidified chamber\nand add 40 μL droplets of PLA ligation mix for every coverslip. Add the coverslips on top of the droplets with the side containing\ncells facing downward. Place the humidified chamber in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min. Amplification Note: The fluorophore in the Amplification Red detection kit has an\nexcitation/emission wavelength of 594 nm/624 nm, respectively, and can\nbe detected using the Texas Red filter (see Part III.). Alternative\ndetection fluorophores are also available, such as Amplification Green,\nOrange, and Far Red. Place the coverslips back in the 24-well plate and wash twice for 2\nmin each time in PLA wash buffer A at room temperature on a rocker. Prepare the PLA amplification mix by diluting the 5×\namplification buffer with Milli-Q water (1:5 dilution) and add the\npolymerase (1:80 dilution) to the mix. For one coverslip (40 μL): dilute 7.9 μL of 5×\namplification buffer in 31.6 μL of Milli-Q water and 0.5\nμL of polymerase. Wait to add the polymerase until immediately prior to\nincubation. Place a new piece of parafilm in the handcrafted humidified chamber\nand add 40 μL droplets of PLA amplification mix for every\ncoverslip. Add the coverslips on top of the droplets with the side containing\ncells facing downward. Place the humidified chamber in a 37 °C incubator for 100 min,\nprotected from light. Mounting Place the coverslips back in the 24-well plate and wash twice for 10\nmin each time in PLA wash buffer B at room temperature on a rocker. Protect the samples from light by placing aluminium foil over\nthe 24-well plate. Wash for 1 min in 0.01× PLA wash buffer B. Mount coverslips on microscope slides using 3 μL of mounting media\ncontaining DAPI for each coverslip. Let the coverslips dry at room temperature protected from light for\n10 min. Use clear nail polish to seal the edges of the coverslip to the\nslide. Avoid getting air bubbles caught under the coverslip. Store the slides in the dark at 4 °C for up to four days or at\n-20 °C for six months. Part III: Imaging and analysis Imaging Visualise fluorescent signal by a confocal microscopy ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4. Representative images of a single vascular smooth\nmuscle cell displaying a number of proximity ligation\nassay (PLA) dots. Each red dot represents a site where\nthe two primary antibodies have bound to their\nrespective protein within 40 nm of each other. A. Texas Red channel (excitation wavelength 592), in\nwhich the PLA dots are visible. B. Brightfield image of\nthe vascular smooth muscle cell. C. DAPI staining of the\nnucleus (excitation wavelength 353). D. Merged image of\nA, B, and C. Scale = 5 µm Use appropriate microscope settings. In our specific setup, we capture images using a 63× oil\nimmersion objective on either a ZEIS LSM780 or LSM900 laser scanning\nconfocal microscope. Choose a DAPI filter for nucleus detection and a Texas red filter for\nPLA dot detection. To visualise cell contours and contrast, include\na brightfield imaging channel in your microscopy setup ( Figure 4 ). Ensure consistent laser settings are applied for each experiment. Capture full z-stack images of individual cells. Multiple\ncells can be captured per coverslip. For quantitative comparisons, PLA signals of at least 30\ncells are captured from at least three biological\nreplicates. Include a negative control sample as part of the experiment. A\nsuitable negative control may involve the use of two\nprotein-targeting antibodies that are known to have no\nco-localisation and, therefore, should not produce a signal.\nAlternatively, consider using protein knockdown cells for additional\ncontrol measures. Another appropriate control, as implemented in our\nstudy, involves the use of only one of the primary antibodies. Data analysis Note: Analyse the number of fluorescent PLA dots within each cell. Depending\non the desired approach, PLA dots can be quantified on a single mid-cell z-plane\nor conducted on a maximum intensity projection encompassing the entire cell. Open the image file in ImageJ. Make sure to open the images for PLA dots,\nDAPI, and brightfield in separate windows instead of using the merged\nchannels file. You can achieve this by selecting the Split channel option ( Figure 5A ). Figure 5. Data analysis in ImageJ. A. Specific settings for opening a microscopy image in ImageJ. B.\nExample of threshold parameters for visualizing clear dots while\nminimizing background. C. Example of the data output, showing\nthe number of dots per z-stack, with each row corresponding to a\ndifferent stack. Three individual windows, representing the PLA dots, DAPI, and brightfield\nwill now open. Close the DAPI and brightfield windows so that only the PLA\ndots window remains visible. In the ImageJ browser, select Image > Adjust > Threshold . Adjust the threshold parameters by clicking and dragging the upper bar from\nthe left to the right until the dots become clearly visible and the\nbackground is removed. Ensure that the lower bar is set all the way to the\nright ( Figure 5B ). To count the number of dots, select in the ImageJ browser Analyze > Analyze particles . Adjust the size parameters for particle analysis, adjusting both the minimum\nand maximum size. For our experiments, we typically select a particle size range from\n0.3 to 3 micron^2. Particles outside of this range will be excluded\nfrom the count. Adjust these parameters as per specific\nrequirements. Select the Summarize option and click OK. To mark the counted particles in your PLA image window, select the Add\nto manager option before clicking OK . ImageJ will now give an option to process all images. By selecting Yes , ImageJ will count the PLA dots for each stack and generate an\noutput data file for the number of dots per stack ( Figure 5C ). In case the number of\nPLA dots for one specific stack should be counted, select No ,\nand ImageJ will count the dots for the stack you have currently selected in\nyour PLA image window. To compare the average number of PLA dots for each cell under various\nconditions (such as control or pharmacologically treated cells), add the dot\ncounts for each biological replicate into GraphPad PRISM. Analyse the data\nset using a nested t-test to test whether pharmacological treatment has an\nimpact on the number of interactions between two proteins.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research\narticle(s): van der Horst et al. (2021). Dynein regulates Kv7.4 channel trafficking from\nthe cell membrane. J. Gen. Physiol. ( Figures 3F , 6C, 7B&C and 8A).",

    "title": "Fluorescent Biosensor Imaging of Nitrate in Arabidopsis thaliana.",
    "abstract": "Nitrate (NO3-) is an essential element and nutrient for plants and animals. Despite extensive studies on the regulation of nitrate uptake and downstream responses in various cells, our knowledge of the distribution of nitrogen forms in different root cell types and their cellular compartments is still limited. Previous physiological models have relied on in vitro biochemistry and metabolite level analysis, which limits the ability to differentiate between cell types and compartments. Here, to address this, we report a nuclear-localized, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, which we named nlsNitraMeter3.0, for the quantitative visualization of nitrate concentration and distribution at the cellular level in Arabidopsis thaliana. This biosensor was specifically designed for nitrate measurements, not nitrite. Through genetic engineering to create and select sensors using yeast, Xenopus oocyte, and Arabidopsis expression systems, we developed a reversible and highly specific nitrate sensor. This method, combined with fluorescence imaging systems such as confocal microscopy, allows for the understanding and monitoring of nitrate transporter activity in plant root cells in a minimally invasive manner. Furthermore, this approach enables the functional analysis of nitrate transporters and the measurement of nitrate distribution in plants, providing a valuable tool for plant biology research. In summary, we provide a protocol for sensor development and a biosensor that can be used to monitor nitrate levels in plants. Key features This protocol builds upon the concept of FRET biosensors for in vivo visualization of spatiotemporal nitrate levels at a cellular resolution. Nitrate levels can be quantified utilizing the biosensor in conjunction with either a plate reader or a fluorescence microscope.",
    "methods": "Materials and reagents Biological materials Yeast strain: protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5465 (MATa, ura3–52, trp1, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200, pep4::HIS3, prb1Δ1.6R, can1 , GAL+) (ATCC, catalog number: 208289TM), which was obtained from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center (University of California, Berkeley, CA). Sensors: NIT domain/NasR The full-length open reading frame of NasR from Klebsiella oxytoca ( Boudes et al., 2012 ) in the pDONR221 GATEWAY Entry vector was used as a sensory domain to create the nitrate sensors NiMet3.0 and nlsNiMet3.0. Note: Constructs were inserted using an Entry clone by Gateway LR reactions into the yeast expression vectors pDRFlip30. The NiMet3.0 is fused to the full-length of NasR with pDRFlip30 vector and sandwiched between an N-terminal Aphrodite t9 (AFPt9) variant ( Deuschle et al., 2006 ), with nine amino acids truncated off the C terminus, and a C-terminal monomeric Cerulean (mCer) ( Rizzo et al., 2006 ). Note: The pDRFlip30 vector was modified from pDRFlip39 vector (Addgene, catalog number: 65517). Agrobacterium strain: Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 was used here to obtain high transformation rates and high levels of expression, typically leading to high copy insertion into the genome ( Koncz and Schell, 1986 ).

In this section, we just report a few concepts of the sensor design. DNA constructs Based on the FRET characteristic, we designed the Gateway expression clones with an insert of the bacterial ( K. oxytoca ) NasR/NIT domain ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Map of pDRFlip30-NasR plasmids. NasR, an NO3-binding protein, was fused via attB1 and attB2 linkers to a fluorescent protein FRET pair (donor: Aphrodite, and acceptor: Cerulean). The NasR protein (purple) representation is from a published structure of NasR [PDB 4AKK ( Boudes et al., 2012 )]. The Aphrodite (yellow) representation is from a published structure of Venus [PDB 1MYW ( Rekas et al., 2002 )] and the Cerulean (blue) representation is from a published structure of Cerulean [PDB 2WSO ( Lelimousin et al., 2009 )]. Expression of sensors in yeast and fluorescence analysis Yeast transformation The protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5465 is transformed with the sensors containing the desired above (e.g., NiMet-NIT, NiMet1.0, NiMet2.0, NiMet3.0, nlsNiMet3.0, or NiMet3.0-NRs) by using the modified lithium acetate method from Gietz et al. (1992). In brief: Inoculate cultures in YPD medium and grow at 30 °C overnight to absorbance ~0.5 at OD 600 nm. Spin down (2,000× g ) 1 mL of cells in a microfuge tube (15 s) for each transformation. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 μL of YPD medium by vortexing. Add 2 μL of 10 mg/mL carrier DNA and vortex. Add ~1 μg plasmid and vortex. Add 0.5 mL of PLATE mixture [100 mL stock containing 90 mL of 45% PEG4000, 10 mL of 1 M lithium acetate, 1 mL of 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mL of 0.5 M EDTA] and vortex. Add 20 μL 1 M DTT and vortex. Incubate at 25 for 6–8 h or overnight. Heat-shock cells for 10 min at 42 °C. Place a pipette tip directly into the bottom of the tube, withdraw 50–100 μL of cells, and plate cells on solid - ura DropOut medium. Wrap plates with plastic cling wrap to prevent dehydration. Incubate plates (lid down) at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Detection of NitraMeter responses in yeast using a fluorimeter Select transformed yeast on solid YNB supplemented with 2% glucose and - ura DropOut medium. Pick single colonies by using sterile pipette tips and grow in a 50 mL tube containing 10 mL of - ura DropOut liquid medium. Pick at least three independent colonies. Note: Use fresh transformation. To avoid mutations in yeast or plasmid, do not keep colonies for more than one week on plates. Place tubes in a rack and incubate in an incubator for ~15 h under agitation (220 rpm) at 30 °C until the culture reaches absorbance ~0.5 at OD 600nm . Subculture liquid cultures after dilution to OD 600nm 0.01 in the same liquid medium and grow at 30 °C until absorbance reaches ~0.3 at OD 600nm . Collect the cells by centrifugation at 3,000× g for 10 min at RT to precipitate the cells. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the precipitate by vortexing in 10 mL of wash buffer for 15 s at RT. Centrifuge at 3,000× g for 10 min at RT again. Wash the precipitate two more times as in Step e–f to remove traces of growth medium. Resuspend the precipitate to absorbance ~0.5 at OD 600nm in resuspension buffer. Mix cells well and aliquot 100 μL of the culture into wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate. Measure the fluorescence in a fluorescence plate reader in bottom reading mode using 7.5 nm bandwidth for both excitation and emission. Typically, emission spectra are recorded with the following instrument settings: λem 470–570 nm for donor (mCer), step size 5 nm, gain: 75; and λem 520–570 nm for AFPt9, step size 5 nm, gain: 75. Fluorescence from pDRFlip30 (donor, mCer), pDRFlip39 (donor, t7.ed.eCFPt9), and pDRFlip42-linker (donor, mCer) was measured by excitation at λexc 428 nm; AFPt9 is measured with excitation at λexc 500 nm. Use a single or multichannel pipette to add 100 μL of the culture to wells (mix by pipetting up and down) and to add analyte solution to the cells. Set up at least three replicates per treatment. Try to add equal volumes of solutions to reduce variability and use well-calibrated pipettes, since the assays are quantitative and sensitive to differences in volumes/concentration of sensor and analyte. Record the fluorescence immediately (as fast as possible) after addition of substrate or control solution. It takes approximately 10 min to read a full 96-well plate with the parameters mentioned above. For highly accurate analyses, measure only a few wells at a time to reduce differences in analysis time. It is also possible to use instruments with injectors that allow for immediate recording; use rapid switching between wells to record over time. Note: The sensor exhibits functional activity when employed as a purified recombinant protein. Expression of NiMet3.0, NiMet3.0-NR-R176A, and nlsNiMet3.0 in Arabidopsis DNA constructs for expressing sensors in plants Insert open reading sequence of NasR or NasR-NR-R176A into the multiple cloning site of the p16-Kan vector ( Jones et al., 2014 ): 5′-, a sequence coding for the SV40-derived nuclear localization signal LQPKKKRKVGG ( Schuster et al., 2014 ); a sequence coding for Aphrodite; a Gateway cassette including attR1, Chloramphenicol resistance gene, ccdB terminator gene, and attR2; a sequence coding for mCerulean (mCer); and a sequence coding for the cMyc epitope tag -3′, or pZPFlip UBQ10-KAN vector under the control of the UBQ10 promoter. Note: The p16 promoter ( Schuster et al., 2014 ) from the AT3G60245 gene encoding a 16S ribosomal subunit was used to drive the nuclear-localized NiMet3.0 fusion biosensor, whereas the CaMV 35S promoter ( Battraw and Hall, 1990 ) was used to drive the NiMet3.0 and NiMet3.0-NR-R176A fusion biosensor in plants. Recombine in Gateway LR reactions with NasR or NasR-NR-R176A Entry Clones, resulting in NiMet3.0, NiMet3.0-NR-R176A, and nlsNiMet3.0 expression clones. Generate transgenic plants using the Agrobacterium floral dip method Introduce sensors into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. Grow healthy Arabidopsis plants in 12 h of light, 50% humidity, and at 22 °C until they begin to bolt and produce floral inflorescences (3–4 weeks in a growth chamber). Remove siliques and mature flower clusters before floral dipping. Inoculate a single Agrobacterium colony that was transformed with sensors into 5 mL of liquid LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics [spectinomycin (final concentration 100 μg/mL)] for binary vector selection. Incubate the culture at 28 °C overnight. The following morning, use this feeder culture to inoculate 200 mL of liquid LB with spectinomycin (final concentration 100 μg/mL) and grow the culture at 28 °C for 16–24 h. Collect Agrobacterium cells by centrifugation at 3,000× g for 10 min at RT and discard the supernatant. Then, gently resuspend cells in one volume of the freshly made dipping medium. Dilute Agrobacterium cells to 6 × 10 9 cells/mL. Spray the Agrobacterium on the floral part of the Arabidopsis . Then, lay down the dipped plants in a plastic basin and cover them with plastic wrap for 16–24 h to maintain high humidity. The next day, remove the cover and allow them to grow normally for one month in the greenhouse or the growth chamber; withhold watering when siliques turn brown. Select transformants on agar plates containing 1/2× MS medium with vitamins (PhytoTech Labs, M519) and kanamycin (30 mg/L). Imaging the nitrate sensor in Arabidopsis with fluorescence microscopy confocal microscopy Note: Although a fluorescence confocal microscope is the standard equipment used, light-sheet microscopy is another option. The settings for laser intensity, detector, and objective are similar to those for confocal microscopy. Please refer to the detailed procedure of the light-sheet system in the Supplementary information section. Germinate and grow transgenic seedlings Germinate and grow vertically on 1/2× MS modified basal salt mixture without nitrogen, 1% agar, and 0.05% (w/v) sucrose (pH 5.7) plates. Place 5- or 6-day-old seedlings in the solution containing 1/2× MS medium [1/2× MS and 0.05% sucrose (pH 5.7)] and prepare for imaging on glass slides. Nitrate treatments on glass slides for confocal microscopy Place seedlings on glass slides with 50 μL of solution, surround with a rectangle of vacuum grease, and cover with a square coverslip equal in height and half the width of the vacuum grease rectangle. Exchange the nitrate treatment solution beneath the coverslip by addition to the left and removal from the right side of the coverslip. Acquire confocal images on a Zeiss 780 laser scanning microscope and use a 20×/0.8 Plan-Apochromat dry objective or 40×/1.2 C-Apochromat water objective. Excite CFP (440 nm) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; 514 nm) with lasers. Detect fluorescence emission using a GaAsP photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector, set to detect 463–508 nm for CFP, and a normal PMT detector, set to 520–585 nm for YFP. Set the laser power between 0.5% and 2% with detector gain set to 700–750 to image CFP or YFP. Acquire images at time points based on the purpose of the research (refer to the note below for details on time point settings). Acquire three-dimensional images, with a z-step size of 1.5 μm and half the diameter of the primary root axis in Arabidopsis . Notes: i. For example, if the purpose is to observe the nitrate distribution in the root after different concentrations of medium supplement, it is suitable to set the range and interval of the time points to less than an hour, unless the sample can be kept moist. Additionally, fluorescence blenching should be considered when continuously recording. ii. For other methods that can be used to obtain continuous images or video, please refer to the Supplementary information.",

    "title": "Generating ER-TRG and CA-ER-TRG Knock-in Mice and Quantitative In Vivo Imaging of ER-phagy.",
    "abstract": "ER-phagy, a selective autophagy process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), has been challenging to study in vivo due to the lack of suitable spatiotemporal quantification tools. Existing methods like electron microscopy, biochemical assays, and in vitro reporters lack resolution, scalability, or physiological relevance. Here, we present a detailed protocol for generating two transgenic mouse models: ER-TRG (constitutively expressing an ER lumen-targeting tandem RFP-GFP tag) and CA-ER-TRG (Cre-recombinase-activated ER-TRG). Additionally, we outline procedures for quantitative imaging of ER-phagy in vivo, covering tissue preparation, confocal microscopy, and signal analysis. This protocol offers a robust and reproducible tool for investigating ER-phagy dynamics across various tissues, developmental stages, and pathophysiological conditions, facilitating both fundamental and translational research. Key features • Enables live, single-cell resolution imaging of ER-phagy dynamics across intact tissues in mice. • Features a Cre-recombinase-activated knock-in model (CA-ER-TRG) for spatiotemporally controlled ER-phagy studies in specific cell types. • Quantifies ER-phagy flux via pH-sensitive RFP-GFP signal ratiometry and lysosomal co-localization in vivo.",

Capillary glass tubes G-100 (Narishige, catalog number: G-100)\n\nProcedure A. Generating ER-TRG knock-in mice 1. Clone the ssRFP-GFP-KDEL ORF from pCW57-CMV-ssRFP-GFP-KDEL as ER-phagy reporter sequence into a donor vector for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in at the Hipp11 (H11) locus on chromosome 11. The donor vector (pER-TRG) was based on an H11-CAG-PMD18T backbone, a proprietary vector system provided by GemPharmatech. The expression cassettes, consisting of the CAG promoter (CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin), Kozak sequence (GCCACC), the ssRFP-GFP-KDEL ORF, and a polyA signal, were flanked by homology arms targeting the murine H11 locus ( Figure 1 ). Both the 5′ and 3′ homology arms were approximately 1,100 base pairs (bp) in length, corresponding to the genomic sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the intended H11 cleavage site. The complete plasmid sequences are provided in Supplementary Data 1. Notes: 1. ssRFP stands for a fusion construct consisting of the signal sequence of the ER chaperone BIP (hereafter referred to as ss) fused to red fluorescent protein (ssRFP), to serve as a marker for protein secretion and ER localization. 2. The plasmid pH11-CAG-PMD18T was designed and constructed by Gempharmatech. Detailed information on the construction and sequence of this proprietary vector can be obtained directly from Gempharmatech. Figure 1. Generation of ER-TRG mice. Schematic diagram illustrating the gene targeting strategy for generating the ER-TRG mouse model via CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knock-in. The ssRFP–GFP–KDEL cassette, containing a Kozak sequence (GCCACC), is inserted into the H11 locus under the control of the CAG promoter (CMV immediate early enhancer/β-actin promoter). 2. Generation of genome-edited mice via zygote microinjection a. For the preparation of CRISPR-Cas9 microinjection solution, mix commercially synthesized H11-specifc gRNA, donor vector, and Cas9 protein. The final concentrations of CRISPR-Cas9 components in 0.6 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 2 mM potassium acetate microinjection buffer were as follows: gRNA (2 pmol/μL), Cas9 protein (25 ng/μL), and donor vector (from 0.01 to 0.05 pmol/μL). Filter the final injection solution through Millipore centrifugal columns and spin at 20,000× g for 10 min at room temperature (RT) [9,10]. Note: H11-specifc gRNA: CTGAGCCAACAGTGGTAGTA b. Obtain fertilized oocytes (zygotes) at the pronuclear stage from superovulated C57BL/6J female mice. In brief, inject intraperitoneally 8–10-week-old females with 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG), followed by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 48 h later. Immediately after hCG administration, mate the females with C57BL/6J stud males. Check for the presence of a vaginal plug the following morning. Collect zygotes from the oviducts of plugged females approximately 20–22 h post-hCG injection. Remove cumulus cells by brief incubation in M2 medium containing 300 μg/mL hyaluronidase. Wash the zygotes and culture them in KSOM medium covered with mineral oil at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere until microinjection. c. Perform cytoplasmic microinjections in M2 media using a transjector and Narishige NT-88NE micromanipulators attached to a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope. The total injection volume was approximately 1–2 pL per zygote, which was estimated based on the volume displacement in the injection needle [9]. 3. Embryo transfer a. Mate virgin ICR female mice (8–12 weeks old) with vasectomized ICR male mice. Check for the presence of a vaginal plug the following morning. Females with a visible vaginal plug were designated as pseudo-pregnant and used as foster mothers for embryo transfer on the same day (0.5 days post-coitum, dpc). b. Transfer oocytes that survived microinjections to the oviducts of pseudopregnant ICR foster mice and carry them to term. Identify positively targeted F0 animals by PCR and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies. 4. Identify offspring with successful knock-in via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping (see ER-TRG mice genotyping). Maintain heterozygous lines to avoid homozygote weight reduction. B. ER-TRG mice genotyping 1. Tail-clip and toe-tag offspring at 5–7 days and extract genomic DNA for PCR to identify and confirm the genotype. 2. Immediately place tail or toe clip samples (~1–2 mm) in 200 μL of NaOH (50 mM) and incubate at 100 °C for 45 min to lyse cells and denature proteins. 3. Following lysis, briefly centrifuge samples at 12,000× g for 1 min to pellet insoluble debris. 4. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new tube. Add 20 μL of Tris-HCl (1 M, pH 8.0) to neutralize the NaOH. Vortex the mixture briefly to ensure homogeneity and then centrifuge for a few seconds to collect the solution at the bottom of the tube. Use the neutralized lysate (1–5 μL, typically) directly as the template DNA source for PCR amplification. 5. Perform PCR using specific primer sets as shown in Table 1 to distinguish wild-type (WT) and knock-in alleles. 6. Resolve PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Expected band sizes confirm genotype. Table 1.

Primary hepatocytes isolation and cultures 1. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of adult male mice using a previously described method [11]. First, adult ER-TRG (+/−) mice were anesthetized. The inferior vena cava was then cannulated, and the liver was perfused sequentially with 10 mL of Buffer I (Ca 2+ -free, containing EDTA) to chelate calcium and clear blood, followed by 5 mL of Buffer II containing collagenase to dissociate the extracellular matrix at 37 °C. 2. Excise the liver and gently dissociate cells in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. 3. Filter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer. 4. Centrifuge filtrate at 100× g for 2 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat it once. 5. Resuspend hepatocytes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Plate cells on collagen-coated dishes and maintain at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Fluorescence images of hepatocytes from ER-TRG (+/−) mice are demonstrated in Figure 2 . Figure 2.

(A) Merged channel of RFP and GFP signals. (B–D) Magnified views of the region outlined by the dashed box, representing the RFP channel (B), the GFP channel (C), and their merged channel (D). Scale bar: 10 μm. D. Tissues lysis and western blotting 1. Rapidly excise tissues from euthanized mice, snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C. 2. Homogenize ~30 mg of tissue in a 10-fold mass ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, using a mechanical tissue grinder on ice. 3. Centrifuge homogenates at 13,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C. Collect supernatant. 4. Determine protein concentration using a BCA kit. 5. Load 20–30 μg of denatured protein lysates onto the same SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. 6. Transfer proteins to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes using standard wet-transfer techniques. 7. Block PVDF membrane with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h at RT. 8. Incubate with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Wash with TBST three times. 9. Incubate with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000) for 2 h at RT. Wash with TBST three times. 10. Detect signals using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and image with a Tanon 5200 imaging system. Quantify band intensity using ImageJ. ER-phagy flux is indicated by the ratio of cleaved RFP band intensity to full-length RFP-GFP band intensity ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Immunoblot analysis of ssRFP-GFP-KDEL expression and ER-phagy activity in transgenic mouse liver. Immunoblot analysis of ssRFP-GFP-KDEL expression in liver tissues of transgenic mice. Liver homogenates from ER-TRG (+/−) transgenic mice were probed with an anti-RFP antibody, detecting both the full-length RFP-GFP protein and its cleavage fragments. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Lanes 1−4 represent individual mice. E. Immunohistochemistry 1. Transcardially perfuse mice with PBS followed by freshly prepared 4% PFA. 2. Dissect tissues and post-fix in 4% PFA (20× tissue volume) overnight at 4 °C. 3. Wash fixed tissues in PBS. Incubate sequentially in 20% and 30% (w/v) sucrose/PBS solutions (20× tissue volume) at 4 °C until tissues sink. 4. Embed tissues in OCT compound. Section frozen tissues at 10–30 μm thickness using a cryostat. Mount sections on adhesive slides. 5. For immunostaining, rehydrate and wash sections 3× with PBS (5 min each) and then counterstain with DAPI (1 μg/mL) for 10 min. Wash sections 3× with PBS (5 min each) and mount sections using a mounting reagent for confocal imaging. 6. For staining with monoclonal antibodies, rehydrate and wash sections with PBS, permeabilize sections in permeabilization buffer for 15–20 min at RT, and then block and incubate sections in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. Incubate sections with primary antibodies, which were diluted in blocking buffer, overnight at 4 °C. Following the wash with PBS, incubate sections with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647) for 1 h at RT in the dark. Counterstain sections with DAPI and mount them as described in step E5. F. Fluorescence imaging 1. Conduct imaging on a Zeiss LSM 800 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4-NA oil-immersion objective, 40×/0.95-NA air-immersion objective, and photomultiplier tube detector. Set the following parameters: GFP (ex: 488 nm, em: 480–580 nm), RFP (ex: 561 nm, em: 575–700 nm), DAPI (ex: 353 nm, em: 40–495 nm), and Alexa Fluor 647 (ex: 633 nm, em: 640–710 nm). Use separate scanning tracks for each excitation and emission set. 2. Acquire images using ZEN (blue edition) software and perform 3D reconstructions with Imaris 9.3.1 software. 3. Adjust the gain for each fluorophore individually. Monomeric GFP is inherently brighter than monomeric RFP. However, RFP shows a unique behavior: when it accumulates in vesicular structures and forms multimers, its emitted signal becomes significantly brighter than in its monomeric state. As a result, the signal intensities of vesicles with multimeric RFP can exceed the “background” level of cytosolic RFP monomers. This multimer-related signal enhancement does not occur with GFP. a. Determine the gain settings based on the RFP intensity in tissue sections. In comparative studies, keep these settings consistent across the same tissues. For quantification, optimize gain settings by averaging the gain of six sections for each channel using the gain/offset histogram tool in Zen Black. This ensures signal maximization below saturation and prevents undersaturation, allowing clear visualization of unsaturated, separate RFP puncta in cells. b. Subsequently, adjust the GFP fluorescence intensity. The goal is to clearly highlight RFP-only puncta and minimize the diffuse RFP + GFP + signal. In most images, slightly increase the GFP signal to better delineate cell and tissue contours. Set the gains and offsets for the LAMP1 channel using the same criteria when applicable. 4. Representative fluorescence images of liver tissue from ER-TRG (+/−) mice, acquired using a Zeiss LSM 800 laser scanning confocal microscope, are shown in Figure 4 . Ensure that each image represents a minimum of four to five animals. Figure 4. Fluorescence image of liver tissue from ER-TRG (+/−) mice. Representative confocal microscopy images of RFP and GFP fluorescence in liver tissue from adult ER-TRG (+/−) mice, acquired with a Zeiss LSM 800 laser scanning confocal microscope. The “Merge” panel represents merged channels of RFP, GFP, and DAPI, and the insets shown an enlarged image of the area indicated by the dashed frame. Scale bars: 20 μm (main panels) and 10 μm (insets). G. Generating CA-ER-TRG knock-in mice 1. Insert a loxP-stop-loxP (LSL) cassette between the CAG promoter and the ORF of the ssRFP-GFP-KDEL fusion protein, with a Kozak sequence (GCCACC) upstream of the ORF start codon. Note: The donor vector (pCA-ER-TRG) was based on an H11-CAG-PMD18T backbone, a proprietary vector system provided by GemPharmatech. The expression cassettes, consisting of the CAG promoter, an LSL cassette, Kozak sequence, the ssRFP-GFP-KDEL ORF, and a polyA signal, were flanked by homology arms targeting the murine H11 locus ( Figure 5 ). Both the 5′ and 3′ homology arms were approximately 1,100 bp in length, corresponding to the genomic sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the intended H11 cleavage site. The complete plasmid sequences are provided in Supplementary Data 2. 2. The subsequent procedures are described in steps A2–4 . Figure 5. Generation of CA-ER-TRG mice. Schematic diagram illustrating the gene targeting strategy for generating the CA-ER-TRG mouse model. The ssRFP–GFP–KDEL cassette, containing a Kozak sequence (GCCACC), was inserted into the H11 locus under the control of the CAG promoter. A loxP-stop-loxP cassette was placed between the CAG promoter and the ssRFP–GFP–KDEL cassette. H. CA-ER-TRG mice genotyping 1. Perform PCR using specific primer sets. See Table 2 for the distinction between wild-type (WT) and knock-in (KI) alleles. 2. The subsequent procedures are described in steps B1–6 . Table 2.

AAV-based Cre recombinase delivery to CA-ER-TRG mice 1. Recombinant AAV serotypes (e.g., AAV-PHP.eB for the central nervous system and AAV2/8 for the liver; the production method is given in [12]) expressing Cre recombinase under a cell type–specific promoter (e.g., hSyn1 for neurons, GFAP for astrocytes, TBG for hepatocytes) were obtained or produced. The viral titer was adjusted to ≥1 × 10 13 vg/mL. Note: The recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) used in this study was custom-produced by Wzbio (Shandong, China). It is an AAV-PHP.eB serotype vector encoding Cre recombinase under the control of the human synapsin (hSyn) promoter. The virus was purified by iodixanol gradient centrifugation, and the final titer was determined by qPCR to be 5.0 × 10 12 vector genomes (vg) per milliliter. 2. Intravenously inject each CA-ER-TRG (+/−) mouse with 1 × 10 11 –1 × 10 12 vg of AAV-Cre via the tail vein. 3. Three to four weeks post-injection, anesthetize mice and subject them to transcardial perfusion. Following perfusion, promptly harvest target tissues for subsequent fixation, sectioning, and confocal imaging analysis ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6. Induction and validation of cell type–specific ER-phagy in CA-ER-TRG mice. Representative confocal microscopy images of RFP and GFP fluorescence in hippocampal CA1 region neurons of CA-ER-TRG (+/−) mice after AAV-hSyn-Cre infection. The “R-G merge” panel represents the merged channels of RFP and GFP, while the “Merge” panel shows the merged channels of RFP, GFP, and DAPI. Scale bar: 20 μm. J. Generating inducible ER-TRG (Aldh1l1-CreERT2+/−; CA-ER-TRG+/−) mice 1. CA-ER-TRG mice were crossed with Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice. The ERT2 domain is a modified estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain that renders the Cre recombinase activity tamoxifen-inducible. In the absence of tamoxifen, the ERT2-Cre fusion protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon tamoxifen administration, it translocates to the nucleus to induce recombination. Note: The Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mouse model is a knock-in line engineered to enable inducible genetic manipulation in astrocytes with high selectivity and efficiency. It was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to insert a T2A-CreERT2 fragment immediately before the stop codon of the endogenous Aldh1l1 gene. The expression of the inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT2) is under the control of the native Aldh1l1 promoter, ensuring astrocyte-specific expression [8]. Genotyping of the mice was performed by PCR, with amplicon sizes of 2,126 bp for the 5′ homology arm, 1,457 bp for the 3′ homology arm, and 452 bp for the wild-type allele, confirming precise genomic integration. 2. Genotype offspring to identify double heterozygous mice (Aldh1l1-CreERT2+/−; CA-ER-TRG+/−). Primers for Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice genotyping are listed in Table 3 . Table 3.

Administer tamoxifen (e.g., 75 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in corn oil intraperitoneally for two consecutive days to induce Cre-mediated excision of the STOP cassette, thereby activating ER-TRG expression. 4. Analyze tissues 7 days after the final injection. 5. Representative fluorescence images of brain tissue from inducible ER-TRG (Aldh1l1-CreERT2+/−; CA-ER-TRG+/−) after tamoxifen treatment are shown in Figure 7 . Figure 7. Assessment of ER-phagy activity in inducible ER-TRG mice. Inducible ER-TRG (Aldh1l1-CreERT2+/−; CA-ER-TRG+/−) mice were treated with tamoxifen for 2 days, and fluorescence images were acquired 7 days after treatment. Representative fluorescence images of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex of inducible ER-TRG mice are presented. Mice without tamoxifen treatment were used as controls. Tamoxifen is dissolved in corn oil for intraperitoneal injection in mice due to its lipophilic nature, which ensures both effective dissolution and sustained release of the drug. Scale bar: 10 μm.\n\nValidation of protocol All experiments were independently repeated at least three times. For each tissue type, a minimum of four fluorescence images were acquired from the ER-TRG and CA-ER-TRG mice. Fluorescence images from wild-type mouse tissues served as controls, and the fluorescence intensity from the ER-TRG and CA-ER-TRG mice was calculated and normalized to the average intensity of the control group. All images of the same tissue type were captured using identical fluorescence parameter settings. Statistical significance was assessed using Student’s t-test. The data are shown as mean ± SEM (with error bars in some figures representing SD), and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This protocol has been used and validated in the following research articles: • Sang et al. [7]. Visualizing ER-phagy and ER architecture in vivo. J. Cell Biol. • Li et al. [14].

    "title": "Puromycin Proximity Ligation Assay (Puro-PLA) to Assess Local Translation in Axons From Human Neurons.",
    "abstract": "Local mRNA translation in axons is crucial for the maintenance of neuronal function and homeostasis, particularly in processes such as axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, due to the long distance from axon terminals to the soma. Recent studies have shown that RNA granules can hitchhike on the surface of motile lysosomal vesicles, facilitating their transport within the axon. Accordingly, disruption of lysosomal vesicle trafficking in the axon, achieved by knocking out the lysosome-kinesin adaptor BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), decreases the levels of a subset of mRNAs in the axon. This depletion impairs the local translation of mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and axonal degeneration. Various techniques have been developed to visualize translation in cells, including translating RNA imaging by coat protein knock-off (TRICK), SunTag, and metabolic labeling using the fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT) systems. Here, we describe a sensitive technique to detect newly synthesized proteins at subcellular resolution, the puromycin proximity ligation assay (Puro-PLA). Puromycin, a tRNA analog, incorporates into nascent polypeptide chains and can be detected with an anti-puromycin antibody. Coupling this method with the proximity ligation assay (PLA) allows for precise visualization of newly synthesized target proteins. In this article, we describe a step-by-step protocol for performing Puro-PLA in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal cultures (i3Neurons), offering a powerful tool to study local protein synthesis in the axon. This tool can also be applied to rodent neurons in primary culture, enabling the investigation of axonal protein synthesis across species and disease models. Key features • Establishment of quantitative local translation assay in axons of human iPSC-derived neurons. • Microscopy-based direct visualization of local translation events in neurons. • Puro-PLA is a sensitive method for detecting new protein synthesis occurring within minutes in neurons, enabling precise temporal analysis of translation dynamics.",

To prepare Matrigel coating medium, use 800 µL of cold KnockOut DMEM/F12 medium (straight from the 4 °C refrigerator, do not prewarm) to dissolve the 500 µL frozen Matrigel aliquot on ice. Add the dissolved Matrigel to 50 mL of cold KnockOut DMEM/F12 medium. Perform this step quickly and without prewarming any solution. Critical: Matrigel polymerizes quickly if it is exposed to room temperature. Once dissolved in KnockOut DMEM/F12 medium, keep it stored at 4 °C for up to ten days. b. Add 8 mL of Matrigel coating medium to a 10 cm tissue culture plate and allow it to coat for at least 1 h and up to overnight at 37 °C. Coated plates can be stored at 37 °C inside the incubator for three to five days. Figure 1. Schematic representation of thawing and plating of frozen induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 2. Thawing iPSCs a. Prepare E8Flex medium and complete E8Flex medium (see Recipes). b. Warm up the complete E8Flex medium using a water bath or a dry bead bath kept at 37 °C. c. Remove the Matrigel coating medium from the 10 cm tissue culture plate. Add 10 mL of warm complete E8Flex medium to the plate. The plate is now ready to be used for the seeding of iPSCs. d. Thaw a frozen vial of iPSCs using a water bath at 37 °C for a few minutes ( Figure 1 ). e. Add 1 mL of complete E8Flex medium to the cells and transfer them into a 15 mL conical tube. f. Centrifuge the cells at 250 rcf for 3 min. g. Remove the supernatant containing the freezing medium and resuspend the cells with 1 mL of complete E8Flex medium. h. Count the cells using an automated cell counter (alternatively, use a hemocytometer). i. Calculate the cell density and add 1 million cells in a 10 cm plate containing complete E8Flex medium. j. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 and 95% air incubator. k. After 24 h, the cells will start dividing and forming small islands. At this point, the complete E8Flex medium can be replaced with E8Flex medium. Replace the medium with new warm E8Flex medium every other day until the cells reach 80% confluency. B. Human iPSC-to-i3Neuron induction 1. Preparing plates and induction medium a. Prepare a Matrigel-coated plate as described in step A1. b. Prepare induction medium and complete induction medium (see Recipes). c. Warm up the complete induction medium using a water bath or a dry bead bath kept at 37 °C. d. Replace the Matrigel-coating medium with 10 mL of warm complete induction medium. The plate is now ready to be used for the induction of iPSCs. Figure 2. Schematic representation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) induction and differentiation into i3Neurons 2. Plating iPSCs for induction into i3Neuron a. Take the 80% confluent iPSC plate and remove the medium ( Figure 2 ). b. Wash the cells by adding 5 mL of sterile 1× PBS. c. Remove the 1× PBS and add 1 mL of Accutase. d. Keep the plate in the incubator for 3 min. e. Add 1 mL of complete induction medium and lift the cells by gentle pipetting. f. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube. g. Centrifuge the cells at 250 rcf for 3 min. h. Remove the supernatant containing the Accutase and resuspend the cell pellet using 1 mL of complete induction medium. i. Count the cells using an automated cell counter (alternatively, use a hemocytometer). j. Calculate the cell concentration and plate 800,000 cells in the Matrigel-coated 10 cm culture plate containing the complete induction medium. k. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 and 95% air incubator. l. Replace the medium with warm fresh complete induction medium on days 2 and 3. The total induction time, including cell seeding, is three days. On the fourth day, the cells can be lifted for the next step. C. i3Neuron culture 1. Preparing plates containing coated cover glass and complete BrainPhys a. Using sterile forceps, place a sterile round cover glass in each well of a 24-well plate. b. Add 1 mL of Poly-L-lysine hydrobromide coating solution in each well and incubate overnight at 37 °C. Note: After a few hours, gently press the cover glass down to the bottom of the well using a sterile 1 mL pipette tip. This step ensures that the cover glass is fully submerged in the coating solution and firmly placed at the bottom of the plate. c. Wash each cover glass three times with sterile water. d. Add laminin coating solution to each well and incubate for 45 min at 37 °C. e. Wash each cover glass three times with sterile water. f. Add 1 mL of complete BrainPhys medium to each well. The plate is now ready for neuron plating. g. Warm up the complete BrainPhys medium in a 37 °C water bath or bead bath before use. Figure 3. Schematic representation of plating and maintenance of i3Neurons 2. Plating i3Neurons a. Remove the complete induction medium from the induced iPSCs ( Figure 3 ). b. Wash the cells by adding 5 mL of sterile 1× PBS. c. Remove the 1× PBS and add 1 mL of Accutase. d. Place the plate in the incubator for 3 min. e. Add 1 mL of complete BrainPhys medium and gently pipette to lift the cells. f. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube. g. Centrifuge the cells at 250 rcf for 3 min. h. Carefully remove the supernatant containing Accutase and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of complete BrainPhys medium. i. Count the cells and then plate 20,000 cells per well in the 24-well plate containing the coated coverslips and complete BrainPhys medium. j. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 and 95% air incubator. k. Replace half of the medium every three days with fresh, prewarmed complete BrainPhys medium. Gently apply the medium along the wall of the well. Note: As axons extend and form a delicate, intricate network, they become susceptible to damage from fast medium exchanges. Use gentle pipetting for medium replacement to avoid lifting neurons from the cover glass. Do not use vacuum aspiration. l. Continue performing half-medium changes with complete BrainPhys medium until the day of the experiment. D. Puromycin proximity ligation assay (Puro-PLA) 1. Puromycin labeling of i3Neuron a. Use a 25-day-old culture of i3Neuron grown on coverslips. b. Prepare 2 µM puromycin-containing neuronal medium as follows: add 20 µL of puromycin from 1 mM stock to 10 mL of complete BrainPhys medium. Note: This volume is sufficient for eight cover glasses. Adjust the medium volume as needed. Prepare the puromycin-containing neuronal medium fresh as extended storage of puromycin may reduce activity. c. Warm up the puromycin-containing neuronal medium to 37 °C. d. Remove the existing medium from the wells and add 1 mL of complete BrainPhys medium containing 2 µM puromycin to each well. e. Incubate the neurons for 10 min in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C. f. Immediately wash the neurons once with ice-cold 1× PBS. g. Add 1 mL of fixative (4% PFA) kept at room temperature and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (22–25 °C). h. Wash the neurons three times with 1× PBS, then proceed with Puro-PLA labeling. Note: As a negative control, keep one set of WT i3Neurons without puromycin treatment. Another possible negative control is to treat the cells with anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. 2. Transfer of cover glasses onto Parafilm a. Cut a piece of Parafilm to fit the lid of a 24-well plate. b. Mark the lid according to the experimental setup. c. Tightly attach the Parafilm to the surface of the lid ( Figure 4 ). d. Carefully remove each cover glass, one at a time, from the 24-well plate and place it onto the Parafilm-covered lid with the neuron side facing up. Add 50 µL of 1× PBS on each cover glass to prevent the sample from drying out. Note: Placing the cover glass on top of Parafilm minimizes the risk of neuron detachment during washing and handling. It is particularly important to use a small buffer volume (100 µL) for washing, as detachment is more likely to occur in a well with a larger volume of solution. The hydrophobic nature of Parafilm also helps to keep the solution confined to the cover glass. Figure 4. Photograph of cover glasses placed on a parafilm-wrapped 24-well plate lid 3. Blocking and primary antibody incubation a. Use the Duolink ® In Situ Detection Reagents Red kit to detect the PLA signal. Note: The following protocol is adapted from the manufacturer’s instructions. b. Vortex the Duolink ® blocking solution to ensure it is well mixed. c. Gently remove the 1× PBS from the coverslip by pipetting. The neurons are facing up. d. Apply 50 µL of Duolink ® blocking solution to each coverslip. e. Incubate the neurons for 30 min in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. Note: To create a humidified incubation chamber, place wet tissue paper inside a flat plastic container with a lid and keep it in a 37 °C incubator. This setup prevents evaporation due to heat. Use this humidified chamber for all subsequent incubation steps. f. Prepare the primary antibodies by diluting them in Duolink ® antibody diluent. Note: Dilute primary antibodies according to the manufacturer’s recommendation for immunofluorescence. Use a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-puromycin antibody and 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-RPS7 antibody. g. Gently remove the Duolink ® blocking solution from the coverslip by pipetting. h. Add 50 µL of the diluted primary antibody mixture onto each coverslip and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in the humidified chamber. 4. PLA probe incubation a. Prepare the PLA probe mix by vortexing the probes, then dilute them 1:5 in Duolink ® antibody diluent as follows: for each coverslip, prepare a total reaction volume of 40 µL by combining 8 µL of PLA probe anti-mouse MINUS, 8 µL of PLA probe anti-rabbit PLUS, and 24 µL of Duolink ® antibody diluent. Note: 40 µL is the minimum volume required to cover one coverslip. Scale up the reaction volume according to the experimental setup. Here, we have used anti-rabbit and anti-mouse PLA probes. Alternatively, there are two other Duolink PLA probes available: anti-human (DUO92020 and DUO92021) and anti-goat (DUO92003, DUO92006) that can be used depending on the experimental setup. b. Carefully remove the primary antibodies by gently aspirating from the edge of the cover glass. c. Wash the coverslips twice by gently adding 100 µL of wash buffer A dropwise from the top, allowing each wash to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Note: Avoid drying the cover glass to minimize background signal. d. Add 40 µL of the diluted PLA probe solution to each coverslip and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. 5. Ligation of PLA probes a. Prepare the 1× ligation buffer by diluting the 5× Duolink ® Ligation buffer in molecular-grade water. For each coverslip, prepare a 40 µL reaction volume by mixing 8 µL of 5× Duolink ® ligation buffer with 32 µL of molecular-grade water. Note: 40 µL is the minimum volume required to cover one coverslip. Scale up the reaction volume based on the experimental setup. Ensure the ligation buffer is fully thawed and mixed well before use. b. Carefully remove the PLA probe solution by gently aspirating from the edge of the coverslip. c. Wash the coverslips twice by gently adding 100 µL of wash buffer A dropwise from the top, allowing each wash to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. d. During the wash steps, place the ligase enzyme tube on a freezer block at -20 °C to keep it chilled. e. Prepare the ligation mix immediately before application by adding ligase to the prepared 1× ligation buffer. For a 40 µL reaction volume, add 1 µL of ligase enzyme to 39 µL of 1× ligation buffer and then mix gently. Note: It is crucial to add the ligase immediately before adding the ligation mix to the coverslip to ensure optimal enzyme activity. f. Carefully remove the wash buffer A from the sample by aspirating from the edge of the coverslip. g. Add 40 µL of the prepared ligation mixture to each coverslip. h. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. 6. Amplification of PLA probes a. Prepare the amplification buffer by diluting 5× Duolink ® amplification buffer in molecular-grade water as follows: for each coverslip, prepare 40 µL reaction volume by mixing 8 µL of 5× Duolink ® amplification buffer with 32 µL of molecular-grade water. Note: 40 µL is the minimum volume required to cover each coverslip. Scale up the reaction volume according to the experimental setup. Ensure the amplification buffer is fully thawed and mixed before use and protect it from light, as it is light-sensitive. b. Carefully remove the ligation mixture by aspirating from the edge of the coverslip. c. Wash the coverslips twice by gently adding 100 µL of wash buffer A dropwise from the top, allowing each wash to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. d. During the wash steps, place the polymerase enzyme tube on a freezer block at -20 °C. e. Prepare the amplification solution by adding the polymerase enzyme to the previously prepared 1× amplification buffer as follows: for a 40 µL reaction volume, add 0.5 µL of polymerase enzyme to 39.5 µL of 1× amplification buffer and then mix gently. Note: Add the polymerase immediately before applying the amplification solution to the coverslip to ensure enzyme activity. f. Carefully remove the wash buffer A from the sample by aspirating from the edge of the coverslip. g. Add 40 µL of the prepared amplification solution to each coverslip. h. Incubate for 100 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. i. After incubation, gently remove the amplification solution by aspirating from the edge of the coverslip. j. Wash the coverslips twice by gently adding 100 µL of wash buffer B dropwise from the top, allowing each wash to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. k. Perform a final wash with 0.01× wash buffer B for 1 min at room temperature. E. Immunofluorescence staining after PLA 1. Immunofluorescence staining a. Gently remove the wash buffer B from the sample by aspirating from the edge of the coverslip. b. Re-fix the sample by adding 50 µL of fixative for 10 min at room temperature (22–25 °C). c. Gently remove the fixative from the sample by aspirating from the edge of the coverslip. d. Wash the coverslip three times with 100 µL of 1× PBS. e. Add 50 µL of immunofluorescence blocking buffer and incubate for 10 min. f. During this time, prepare a 1:500 dilution of chicken anti-MAP2 primary antibody in immunofluorescence blocking buffer. g. After the 10 min incubation time, gently remove the immunofluorescence blocking buffer and add 50 µL of primary antibody/blocking buffer mixture per coverslip. Note: Any primary antibody may be used as preferred, following the recommended dilution. However, to avoid cross-reactivity with the antibodies used in step D3f, a different species is required. In this protocol, we used antibodies raised in mouse and rabbit for the Puro-PLA; therefore, we selected a chicken antibody for the immunofluorescence. h. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Note: Alternatively, primary antibody incubation can be performed overnight if required for specific antibodies. i. Carefully aspirate the primary antibody/blocking buffer mixture and wash the coverslip three times with 100 µL of immunofluorescence blocking buffer. j. Prepare a 1:500 dilution of anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody in immunofluorescence blocking buffer and add 50 µL per coverslip. Note: Any secondary antibody may be used as preferred, following the recommended dilution, except those within the red fluorescent spectrum, which was used to detect the PLA signal . k. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. l. Wash the coverslip three times with 100 µL of immunofluorescence blocking buffer. m. Perform a final wash with 100 µL of 1× PBS. n. Prepare a clean slide with 7 µL of DAPI Fluoromount-G mounting media. o. Carefully lift the coverslip using fine forceps and gently remove excess liquid by lightly touching the edge of the coverslip to an absorbent tissue. p. Quickly place the coverslip onto the drop of mounting medium on the slide, neuron side down. q. Place the slide with the mounted sample in a dark, flat box to protect from the light. r. Allow the sample to dry and the mounting medium to solidify for 4 h to overnight at room temperature. Note: For long-term storage, store mounted slides at 4 °C. s. Image the mounted sample using a confocal microscope. F. Image acquisition, analysis, and quantification using ImageJ/Fiji 1. Image capture: Use a confocal microscope (e.g., Zeiss LSM 880) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63× objective lens (NA = 1.4) to image the samples. Capture multiple optical sections and build Z-stacks to obtain images across the entire thickness of the cell. Collect approximately seven sections, spaced ~0.25 µm apart. Note: Any confocal microscope with a 40× or 63× objective can be used for imaging. The image will include three color channels: DAPI (excitation at 405 nm), PLA signal fluorophore, and MAP2 (stained with Alexa Fluor 647, excitation at 647 nm). 2. Image Processing in Fiji: Open the captured image in Fiji (ImageJ) and collapse all the sections by selecting Image > Stacks > Z Project . In the dialog panel that appears, select “Max Intensity” for projection type, then click OK . This step will generate a new image with a single Z-stack containing the three color channels: DAPI, PLA, and MAP2. In Figure 5 , only the MAP2 channel is displayed, showing more intense staining of the soma and dendrites. Axons appear faint in the background. Note that the “z” dimension is no longer visible, as the layers have been collapsed into a single plane. Figure 5. Maximum intensity projection of captured images. The left panel displays the captured image, showing only the MAP2 channel. In the top-left corner, the ZProjection panel is used to generate the maximum intensity projection, which is shown on the right. The soma, dendrite, and axons are indicated. To separate the three color channels, go to Image > Color > Split Channels . This will create three individual images, one for each channel. Select and close the DAPI channel ( Figure 6 ) to focus on the PLA and MAP2 signals. Note: The MAP2 antibody primarily stains the soma and dendrites. Axons will appear in the image as a fainter signal. Figure 6. Single channels for the selected image. The three panels separately display the MAP2 staining (dendrite and soma in cyan), the proximity ligation assay (PLA) signal (red), and DAPI (nuclei in blue). The soma, dendrite, and axons are also indicated. 3. Use the Rectangle tool from the toolbar and draw a 50 × 50 nm square in the MAP2 channel picture. Right-click within the square and select Duplicate . This will create a new image containing only the selected area ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7. Selection and duplication of area of interest. The top-left panel shows neurons stained with MAP2 (cyan). The Rectangle tool is used to select the area of interest (top-right panel), followed by the duplication of the selected area (lower two panels). 4. First, select the duplicated MAP2 image. Adjust brightness and contrast by selecting Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast . Then click Auto to apply automatic adjustments. To smooth the image, go to Process > Smooth . This will help enhance the visibility of finer details in the image ( Figure 8 ). Figure 8. Intensity and Smooth processing of axonal area of interest. The axonal area of interest (left panel) is processed to adjust the brightness and contrast (central panel) and to apply smoothing (right panel). 5. Create an axonal mask using threshold adjustment: With the duplicated MAP2 image selected, go to Image > Adjust > Threshold . In the threshold panel, check Dark Background and then click Auto to automatically set threshold values. This step generates a mask of the axonal area, highlighting regions based on the MAP2 signal present in the axons ( Figure 9 ). Figure 9. Threshold of axonal area. An axonal mask is created by automatically adjusting the Threshold . 6. Select Analyze > Set Measurements > Area; Limit to threshold; Display label ( Figure 10 ). ( Note: This configuration only needs to be performed once to establish the measurements that will be used in the analysis.) After setting the threshold, select Analyze > Measure . A new panel will appear displaying the results ( Figure 10 ). The “Area” value represents the area covered by the MAP2 signal. Please save this value on your Excel table. Figure 10. Settings for measurement and results table. The desired values to be displayed are selected from the Set Measurements panel as shown in the figure. The generated measurements are displayed in the lower panel. 7. Now select the PLA picture and navigate to Edit > Selection > Restore Selection to select the identical square at the same coordinates used for the MAP2 channel. Next, proceed to Duplicate this second channel (right-click) ( Figure 11 ). Figure 11. Selection and duplication of area of interest. The left panel shows the proximity ligation assay (PLA) signal (red). The Rectangle tool is used to select the area of interest, followed by the duplication of the selected area (right panel). 8. Select Process > Smooth > Image > Adjust > Threshold . A panel will appear. Select Dark Background and click Auto . Then, select Analyze > Analyze Particles . You may need to adjust the Size setting for your PLA signal. In this example, we will measure only particles larger than 20 µm 2 , as smaller particles may be background noise ( Figure 12 ). A new panel will appear displaying the results. The Count value indicates the number of PLA reactions detected. Please save this value on your Excel table. Figure 12. Threshold of proximity ligation assay (PLA) panel and particles count. The area of interest (top left panel) showing the PLA signal (red) is processed to apply smoothing (top central panel), and a mask is created by automatically adjusting the Threshold (top right panel). The PLA puncta are then counted using Analyze Particles . The selected particles are shown in the larger central panel. The results appear as a Summary displayed in the lower panel. 9. Compared to the axonal field of WT neurons, axons from BORCS5 KO neurons present a reduced number of PLA particles with a PLA/Area reduction of more than 50% ( Figure 13 ). Figure 13. Wildtype (WT) vs. BORCS5 knock-out (KO) neurons. The MAP2-stained area (left panels), proximity ligation assay (PLA)-counted particles (central panels), and the merged image (right panels) are shown for representative WT neurons (top panels) and BORCS5 KO neurons (bottom panels). Both the MAP2 area and the number of PLA particles are recorded in the Excel file (lowest panel).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and published in the following research article: • De Pace et al.

    "title": "PI(4,5)P2 Imaging Using a GFP Reporter in Living Cells.",
    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] is a phospholipid enriched on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it plays important roles in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics through proteins that directly bind to it. PI(4,5)P2 can be metabolized to other phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol to regulate numerous processes such as cell growth and development. PI(4,5)P2 can also be hydrolyzed to generate the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). Altered metabolism or mislocalization of PI(4,5)P2 can perturb one or more of its functions and contribute to disease states. Here, we present a protocol to visualize and quantify the localization of PI(4,5)P2 in live cells. The protocol uses a highly specific PI(4,5)P2 protein binding domain coupled to enhanced green fluorescence protein (PH-PLCD1-GFP), enabling localization and quantification of cytosol-facing PI(4,5)P2 to be determined. Localization and quantification of the PH-PLCD1-GFP, PI(4,5)P2 specific probe, is enabled by fluorescence imaging and confocal microscopy. This approach can be used to study the dynamics of PI(4,5)P2 localization temporally in live cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. Key features • Protocol for the quantification of PI(4,5)P2 membrane localization in live cells. • Uses the expression of the highly specific PH-PLCD1-GFP, PI(4,5)P2 probe, in cells, followed by fluorescence image acquisition using confocal microscopy and subsequent image processing. • Adaptable to various cell types and experimental conditions. • Presents detailed instructions for reagent preparation, fluorescence measurement, and quantification.",

Biosphere ® plus filter tip, 1000 μL, 200 μL, 100 μL, 10 μL (Sarstedt)\n\nProcedure A. Transfection of U2OS cells with PH-PLCD1-GFP All the following steps are performed in a Class II biosafety cabinet under sterile conditions. 1. Seed U2OS cells in 1 mL of complete media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% AA) in a 2-well chamber slide system at a density of 50,000 cells per well one day prior to transfection. Note: The size of each well in a 2-well chamber slide system is 4.2 cm 2 . If a different well format is used, volumes/concentrations may be upscaled or downscaled accordingly. 2. For cell counting, load 10 μL of cell suspension into each chamber of the dual-chambered counting slide and insert into the Bio-Rad automated cell counter, which automatically provides total cell concentration in cells/mL. 3. On the day of transfection, change media to AA-free DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS (1 mL per well). 4. In a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, dilute PH-PLCD1-GFP DNA plasmid in Opti-MEM to achieve a concentration of 0.5 μg in 75 μL of Opti-MEM per well. 5. In another 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, dilute Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM to achieve a concentration of 3 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 in 75 μL of Opti-MEM per well. 6. Add diluted PH-PLCD1-GFP DNA (0.5 μg in 75 μL of Opti-MEM) to diluted Lipofectamine 2000 (3 μL in 75 μL of Opti-MEM) and gently mix by pipetting. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. 7. Add 150 μL of PH-PLCD1-GFP DNA-Lipofectamine complex mixture dropwise to each well and incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 24 h. 8. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, change transfection media to fresh complete DMEM media with AA and incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for an additional 24 h to allow peak expression of the GFP reporter, consistent with the general transfection guidelines. The post-transfection time frame for optimal reporter expression can be optimized based on the cell type being studied. 9. Following 48 h post-transfection, cells are ready for imaging. The robust expression of the GFP-tagged reporter in over 80% of U2OS cells confirmed successful transfection. B. Imaging U2OS cells transfected with PH-PLCD1-GFP Images of U2OS cells transfected with PH-PLCD1-GFP are acquired using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z.1 spinning disk confocal microscope at 100× magnification in a temperature-controlled chamber maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 and ambient O 2 and humidity following the steps described below. Notes: 1. While not strictly required, a spinning disc confocal microscope was used for live cell Z-stack imaging due to its ability to capture rapid transient dynamics through faster acquisition and its lower phototoxicity. 2. By using the lowest laser power necessary to acquire high-quality images, along with a spinning disk confocal system, photobleaching was minimized and not observed under the conditions used. 3. Imaging was carried out over a period of approximately 10–20 min, during which pH was preserved by using CO 2 -buffered imaging medium. No replenishment of medium was required during the acquisition period as the imaging time was kept short and environmental parameters (e.g., temperature and CO 2 levels) were well controlled. 1. Set up the parameters for image acquisition as follows: laser intensity at 20%, exposure at 65 m/s, and EM gain at 50. Select cells that are well defined and not in proximity to other cells within the microscope field. Note: These settings can be used as a starting point and may require adjustment to optimize the signal to background ratio based on cell type, reporter expression, and microscope configuration ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Zeiss imaging software interface for adjusting image acquisition settings. The full screen view (left) displays the overall interface, with a red square indicating the region that is magnified in the inset (right) to show laser intensity, exposure, and EM gain settings used for image acquisition. 2. Once a cell has been selected, acquire z-stack images using a 488 nm excitation wavelength and an emission filter at 517 nm while keeping a constant interval (0.36 μm) between each focal plane ( Figure 2 ). Note: Image acquisition may be carried out in a blinded manner to minimize bias. Figure 2. Zeiss imaging software interface for adjusting Z-stack image acquisition settings. The full screen view (left) displays the overall interface, with a red square indicating the region that is magnified in the inset (right) to show Z-stack image acquisition settings. 3. After acquiring the Z-stack image, display the image in orthogonal (ortho) mode, position the intersection point at the center of the cell, and create an image from the view ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Zeiss imaging software interface for an orthogonal view of the cell generated from the Z-stack. The full screen view (left) displays the overall interface, with a red square indicating the region that is magnified in the inset (right) to show the intersection point at the center of the cell to generate an orthogonal view. 4. In the graphics section, uncheck the visibility option to hide the lines and save the image in TIFF format ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4. Zeiss imaging software interface for an orthogonal view of the cell generated from the Z-stack. The full screen view (left) displays the overall interface, with a red square indicating the region that is magnified in the inset (right) to demonstrate how to hide axis lines by unchecking the visibility option in the graphics section.

Quantification by FIJI may be carried out in a blinded manner to minimize bias. 2. If your image is too bright or too dark, you may need to adjust the contrast/brightness. 2. Go to the ROI Manager by clicking Analyze > Tools > ROI manager . 3. Select the rectangle tool from the Toolbar to draw the first square on the image. Note: Due to variability in cell size across cell types, the dimensions of the rectangular ROI were not strictly prespecified. Instead, the ROI size was adjusted to ensure appropriate sampling of either cytosolic or membrane signal, while maintaining consistency in size across ROIs within the same imaging field and across the same experiment. The ROI was chosen to be small enough to focus on subcellular regions of interest, rather than encompassing the entire cell. 4. When the rectangle is in the desired position, click Add [t] in the ROI manager. 5. Enable show all on the ROI manager to view all saved ROIs. 6. Draw three equal squares on the dorsal plasma membrane (cell apex and immediately left and right) and another three identical squares below these in the cytosol, and three random squares outside the cell (background) ( Figure 5 ). Notes: 1. For the squares positioned immediately to the left and right of the apex, place the squares at locations that encompass most of the membrane within each square. 2. Membrane intensity was measured at the apical region of the cell to standardize the sampling location. While the GFP signal may vary along the membrane, consistent apical sampling ensured comparability across conditions. 3. A separate membrane marker was not used, as the PH-PLCd1-GFP reporter provides sufficient and specific plasma membrane labeling due to its selective binding to PI(4,5)P 2 . 7. Once the nine squares are added to the ROI manager, click measure in the ROI manager and export results ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5. ImageJ interface showing placement of ROIs corresponding to the plasma membrane, cytosol, and background. Mean fluorescence intensities were measured within each ROI to calculate the plasma membrane to cytosol intensity ratio. 8. Calculate the mean intensity from the three background ROIs and subtract this value from each of the individual mean intensity measurements for the plasma membrane and cytosol. 9. Divide the mean intensity of each of the three squares on the dorsal plasma membrane (one on the apex and two immediately adjacent) by the mean intensity of the cytosolic ROI directly below it. The final plasma membrane to cytosol ratio of PH-PLCD1-GFP per cell is the average of three individual membrane to cytosol ratios. An Excel sheet with representative calculations is included in the supplementary materials (Supplementary file 1). 10. By following steps C1–9, the plasma membrane to cytosol ratio of PH-PLCD1-GFP was quantified for two images to demonstrate the quantification approach described in this protocol ( Figure 6 ).

    "title": "Quantitative Analysis of Kinetochore Protein Levels and Inter-Kinetochore Distances in Mammalian Cells During Mitosis.",
    "abstract": "The mammalian kinetochore is a multi-layered protein complex that forms on the centromeric chromatin. The kinetochore serves as the attachment hub for the plus ends of microtubules emanating from the centrosomes during mitosis. For karyokinesis, bipolar kinetochore-microtubule attachment and subsequent microtubule depolymerization lead to the development of inter-kinetochore tension between the sister chromatids. These events are instrumental in initiating a signaling cascade culminating in the segregation of the sister chromatids equally between the new daughter cells. Of the hundreds of conserved proteins that constitute the mammalian kinetochore, many that reside in the outermost layer are loaded during early mitosis and removed around metaphase-anaphase. Dynamically localized kinetochore proteins include those required for kinetochore-microtubule attachment, spindle assembly checkpoint proteins, various kinases, and molecular motors. The abundance of these kinetochore-localized proteins varies at prometaphase, metaphase, and anaphase, and is thus considered diagnostic of the fidelity of progression through these stages of mitosis. Here, we document detailed, state-of-the-art methodologies based on high-resolution fluorescence confocal microscopy followed by quantification of the levels of kinetochore-localized proteins during mitosis. We also document methods to accurately measure distances between sister kinetochores in mammalian cells, a surrogate readout for inter-kinetochore tension, which is essential for chromosome segregation. Key features • Immunostaining of cultured and suitably fixed adherent mammalian cells growing as monolayers. • Confocal fluorescence imaging for the purpose of fluorescence quantification. • 2D and 3D image reconstruction and analysis of the acquired images using appropriate background correction and normalization. • Quantification of the inter-sister kinetochore distances using 3D image reconstruction. Graphical overview Key steps involved in fluorescence quantification of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein loading at the kinetochores and in the calculation of inter-sister kinetochore distances. High-resolution confocal image datasets of cells subjected to appropriate treatment as per the experimental need (drugs, inhibitors, gene-specific siRNA, etc.) are used for quantifying the levels of SAC proteins at the kinetochores, measuring inter-sister kinetochore distances, or both. Quantification and analysis of both parameters are performed using image analysis software such as Fiji (open source) or the IMARIS software suite. Figure created with BioRender.com.",

Place the tube on a rocker and mix at slow speed until completely dissolved. Avoid frothing of the solution. Caution: High-speed mixing can denature proteins including BSA, of which frothing is a sign. Add 250 μL of Triton X-100 to the solution. Slowly mix the solution on a rocker to dissolve all the components completely. Add 1× PBS to make up the volume to 50 mL and gently mix to homogeneity. Laboratory supplies Clean glass slides and coverslips Critical: The coverslips should be properly cleaned and ideally be of category #1.5 (even thickness between 0.16 and 0.19 mm) to minimize chromatic aberration and refractive index mismatches between the lens, immersion medium, and sample mounting medium.\n\nProcedure Cell fixation and immunofluorescence labeling Note: Prior to fixation and immunofluorescence labeling, cells may be subjected to treatment as per experimental needs. For instance, siRNA-mediated protein depletion or using specific inhibitors against the protein of interest and subsequent scoring for mitotic phenotype(s) may suggest its role in cell division. After treatment of the cells as per experimental requirements, remove the coverslips containing the cells and place them in a fresh 6-well plate with the surface containing the cells facing upward for further processing. Wash the cells 2–3 times with 2 mL of 1× PBS each time. Add 2–3 mL of pre-chilled (at -20 °C) absolute methanol (AR grade or HPLC grade) to the coverslips to fix the cells. Immediately place the 6-well plate at -20 °C for a minimum of 30 min to complete the fixation process. Note: The coverslips may be stored at -20 °C submerged in absolute methanol for an extended period of time without letting the methanol dry out. Note: An alternate method of fixation has been described in the literature for mammalian cell kinetochores, using 4% formaldehyde and a buffer consisting of PIPES-HEPES-EDTA and magnesium chloride (PHEM) [10]. This method may be optimized and alternatively used. If this method of fixation is used, the following immunostaining steps must be immediately performed, since aldehyde fixation does not remain stable over long periods. Additionally, only 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS may also be used for fixation prior to immunostaining [7, 8, 11]. Rehydrate the cells by adding adequate 1× PBS and wash 3–4 times (2 mL each time) to ensure complete rehydration. Use a clean, fine-tipped pair of forceps to lift the coverslips and gently place them cell-side up on a fresh Parafilm TM sheet inside a humidified chamber prepared by lining a large cell culture dish with a damp paper towel and the lid closed. Caution: All following steps are performed in the humidified chamber. Add approximately 50–100 μL of blocking solution on each coverslip to cover the entire surface and leave at room temperature for 1 h. Only enough blocking solution should be added to form a large drop covering the entire coverslip. Prepare the primary antibody solution by diluting all required primary antibodies (caution: raised in different animals) in blocking buffer in a fresh microcentrifuge tube (Mad1: 1:200, CREST: 1:100, α-tubulin: 1:800) at room temperature. After 1 h of blocking, gently aspirate off the blocking solution from the edge of the coverslip to remove the blocking solution, add approximately 40–50 μL of diluted primary antibody to each coverslip, and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Note: 40 μL of the diluted antibody solution is sufficient to cover a 12 mm circle coverslip. Remove the antibody solution and wash the cells thrice with blocking solution. Dilute fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor ® 488 anti-rabbit IgG: 1:800, Alexa Fluor ® 594 anti-mouse IgG: 1:800, and Cy TM 5 anti-human IgG: 1:800) in a single microcentrifuge tube containing blocking solution and add 40–50 μL to each coverslip. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Aspirate off the secondary antibody solution and wash the cells with 1× blocking solution thrice. Wash cells with 1× PBS once to remove the blocking solution. Add 50 μL of diluted DAPI (1:10,000 of a 5 mg/mL stock made in DMSO) and incubate for a maximum of 2 min at room temperature. Aspirate off the DAPI solution and wash the cells thrice with 1× PBS. Wash the cells once with de-ionized water to remove the PBS. Note: The salts in the PBS can cause noise during fluorescence/confocal imaging and must therefore be removed. Label a clean, frosted glass slide on the frosting using a lead pencil. Place 5 µL of ProLong Diamond TM mounting media on it. Gently lift the coverslips using forceps and drain any excess liquid by touching the bottom edge of the vertically held coverslip on a piece of lint-free tissue paper. Place the coverslip on the drop of mounting media (cell-side down) by laying it down gently from one edge and letting the weight of the coverslip spread the mounting media under it as it settles. Remove any trapped air bubbles between the coverslip and the slide by pushing them outward with gentle pressure on the coverslip using the tip of the forceps. Allow the mounted coverslips to air-dry overnight at room temperature, protected from light on a flat, horizontal surface. Caution: This step should not be performed in the humidified chamber. The dried coverslips may be imaged immediately on a confocal microscope or stored at -20 °C in a slide box for later use. Image acquisition Acquire high resolution images of prometaphase and metaphase cells on a Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning optical confocal microscope (or equivalent) using an HC PL APO 63×-1.4 NA oil-immersion objective and a HyD (hybrid) or PMT detector. Keep the imaging parameters constant for all experimental conditions using the Leica LASX software (or other acquisition software, as applicable). Keep the zoom constant at 4.5× for imaging mitotic cells (both metaphase and prometaphase). Use simultaneous scanning sequences for two different wavelength channels for image acquisition. Ensure that the emission wavelength of one fluorophore does not cross-excite any other fluorophore. For example, in scan sequence 1, use laser lines for 405 nm and 594 nm, and in scan sequence 2, use laser lines for 488 nm and 647 nm. Note: Alternatively, image acquisition can be performed using sequential scanning to eliminate the possibility of inadvertent fluorophore cross-excitation. However, the scanning sequence should begin at the highest wavelength (647 nm) and end at the lowest wavelength (405 nm). Critical: An important consideration during imaging for fluorescence quantification is to never expose the fluorophore tagged to the protein of interest while focusing or locating cells prior to image acquisition. This is important to prevent bleaching of the fluorophore when the laser hits the sample and may therefore impact accurate quantitative measurements. Adjust the oversaturation and undersaturation of the emission signals using the Quick Look-up Table (QLUT) or an equivalent feature to stay within the dynamic range of the detectors ( Table 1 ). Table 1. Imaging parameters used during acquisition Checklist of imaging parameter settings to be ensured before imaging S. no. Setting name Imaging parameters Remarks 1 Scan Mode xyz 2 Imaging resolution 1024 × 1024 The images should be acquired at high resolution for effective 2D and 3D quantification. 3 Scan Direction X Bidirectional For faster coverage of the imaged field. 4 Scan Speed 200 Hz Higher frequency (scan speed) enables faster coverage of the imaged field but can compromise image resolution. Caution : For kinetochore fluorescence quantification through fixed cell imaging, image resolution is more important than imaging speed. The software should clearly be able to tell the kinetochore apart from the background (this must be manually ascertained). 5 Magnification 63× Other companies use Plan Apochromat lenses of 60×/64× magnification, for which the parameters would remain similar. 6 Objective name and numerical aperture HC PL APO CS2 63×/1.40 NA (numerical aperture) oil immersion lens A higher NA lens provides better resolution. 7 Immersion Oil (Leica type F immersion liquid, catalog number: 11513859) An equivalent immersion oil/immersion liquid from other manufacturers may also be used. 8 Zoom [Region of Interest (ROI) imaging] 4.5 Keep the zoom factor such that only the dividing cell is imaged (zoom factor was kept at 4.5 in the Leica TCS SP8 microscope). In a laser scanning microscope, this reduces the area of the field that needs to be scanned, leading to faster imaging. 10 Pinhole diameter 0.5 Airy Units (AU) The pinhole diameter is usually set at 1 AU for most confocal microscopes. For kinetochore imaging, which usually shows bright fluorescence emission, a lower pinhole diameter (such as 0.5 AU) increases the x-y resolution. Caution: Lower pinhole diameters cannot be used for weak fluorescence intensity/signals. A good primary antibody that gives a strong and specific fluorescence signal must be used for immunostaining. 11 Scanning sequence 1 488 nm for antigen to be quantified and 647 nm for CREST The two fluorophores can be simultaneously excited, and the emission signals simultaneously captured on two separate detectors. 12 Scanning sequence 2 405 nm for DAPI and 594 nm for microtubules The two fluorophores can be simultaneously excited, and the emission signals simultaneously captured on two separate detectors. Use an imaging pixel format of 1024 × 1024 and a scan speed of 200 Hz for image acquisition. The higher pixel format enables higher image resolution and subsequent quantification of fluorescence intensities with greater accuracy. If required, reduce the pinhole diameter to 0.5 Airy units (AU) for better structural definition of the kinetochores. Note: Reducing the pinhole omits low emission intensities and can therefore be used only when the emission signal is strong. Keep the z-step size at 0.3 μm. Start image acquisition after ensuring all settings are accurate. Acquire z-sections (optical depth section images) of each cell in steps of 0.3 μm each, starting from the first out-of-focus plane on one side of the cell, optically sectioning through the cell, and ending at the first out-of-focus z-plane on the other end of the cell. Image analysis Quantification of SAC proteins at the kinetochore can be achieved using 3D reconstruction of the z-slices in the IMARIS software suite. Alternatively, this can also be performed from 2D images as described in Hoffman et al. [5] using Fiji, Metamorph, or other software packages. Here, we describe the quantification of fluorescence intensities at the kinetochore both in 2D as well as in 3D. The schematics of the workflow are represented as flowcharts for fluorescence intensity measurements in 2D ( Figure 1 ) and 3D ( Figure 2 ). Figure 1. Schematic flowchart for fluorescence intensity measurement in 2D. Open the image in Fiji, select the z-plane with the brightest signal for SAC protein, zoom into the kinetochore area, draw a circular ROI (0.45 μm diameter) around the CREST signal, draw a circular ROI (0.63 µm diameter) around the CREST signal for background correction, measure fluorescence intensity ( Analyze > Measure ), and export all intensity values as an MS Excel spreadsheet for further analyses. Figure created with BioRender.com. Figure 2. Schematic flowchart for fluorescence intensity measurement in 3D. Launch IMARIS software suite, open the image file, select the image to be analyzed, select the channel to be used for analysis, crop the cell in 3D, open the spot function , assign the spot size and add new spot, check the background subtraction box and click the next button, click the statistical spreadsheet followed by detailed button, and export all intensity values as an MS Excel spreadsheet for further analyses. Figure created with BioRender.com. The quantification of SAC protein levels at the kinetochore using 2D imaging (Fiji) is illustrated in Figure 3 with the following steps: For quantification of SAC proteins at the kinetochore, consider cells that have clearly defined kinetochore immunofluorescence (as visualized using the CREST stain). Open the selected cells in Fiji. Choose the z-plane(s) containing the visibly brightest signal for Mad1 (the SAC protein example illustrated here) by going through the entire z-stack and selecting the channels for CREST (resident kinetochore protein) and Mad1 for quantification. Zoom into the kinetochore (chromosomal) region of the cell. It is important to maintain the same zoom for all channels to ensure the regions of interest (ROI) across channels have the same XY dimensions. Draw a circular ROI of diameter 0.45 μm encompassing the CREST signal using the circular drawing tool from the Fiji menu bar and designate it as the inner circle . Critical: The average size may be empirically determined for individual cell lines using several control kinetochores across multiple cells to capture the CREST (kinetochore) signal and the signal of the loaded kinetochore SAC protein. SAC proteins at kinetochores may not always be seen overlaid on the same exact pixels as the kinetochore antigen. The loading of these proteins can accumulate significantly on laterally adjacent pixels attached to the kinetochore, especially in prometaphase. Draw a larger circle of 0.63 μm diameter (approximately double the area of the inner circle) around the inner circle and designate it as the outer circle . The fluorescence intensity from the outer circle will be used for calculating the local background during quantification. Figure 3. Fluorescence quantification of SAC protein loading at the kinetochore in 2D using Fiji image analysis software. The window on the far left is the confocal micrograph showing kinetochores (pseudo-colored in magenta). An ROI is drawn around the kinetochore using the tool shown in the red box. The diameter of each circular ROI is assigned in the window labeled Specify . The box labeled Scaled units (microns) is checked to convert the measurement of the circular ROI to micrometers. Each ROI is added to the ROI manager as shown in the window on the far right and designated as either outer circle or inner circle . The yellow dotted box represents ROIs drawn around each kinetochore to be quantified; the inset of the same represents the zoomed image. Once all ROIs are drawn, measure the fluorescence intensities using the Analyze > Measure tool on the Fiji menu bar. This generates a data sheet for all fluorescence intensities and can be exported as an MS Excel spreadsheet for further calculations. Paste the ROIs from the CREST channel on the Mad1 channel and obtain fluorescence measurements for the Mad1 channel as described in step C6. After exporting the fluorescence intensities from all channels to an MS Excel spreadsheet, perform the following calculations. For calculating the fluorescence intensity of the region between the inner and the outer circles (F S ), subtract the integrated fluorescence of the inner circle (F I ) from the integrated fluorescence of the outer circle (F O ). F S = F O - F I Next, calculate the area of the region between the inner and outer circles (A S ) by subtracting the area of the inner circle (A I ) from the area of the outer circle (A O ). A S = A O - A I Calculate the background intensity (F Background ) using the equation below: F Background = F S (A I /A S ) The background corrected fluorescence intensity of CREST is obtained by subtracting the background intensity (F Background ) from the intensity of the inner circle (F I ). F CREST = F I - F Background Calculate the final fluorescence intensity of Mad1 (F Mad1 ) in the same manner by following steps C10–12 for the Mad1 channel. Normalize the Mad1 intensity to the CREST intensity by dividing the background-corrected Mad1 intensity by the background-corrected CREST intensity for each kinetochore. Mad1:CREST = F Mad1 /F CREST The normalized ratio of Mad1:CREST is plotted as a scatter plot using GraphPad Prism. Note: Other kinetochore resident proteins such as CENP-A and CENP-C (Cmentowski et al [12]) are also commonly used as kinetochore normalization markers. The underlying assumption is that the kinetochore structure and organization (inner and outer kinetochore layers) do not change upon SAC protein loading on the outermost fibrous corona in mitosis. Quantification of inter-kinetochore distance (using Fiji) Sequence of steps for fluorescence intensity measurement in 2D: Open image in Fiji > select z-plane with brightest signal for SAC protein > Analyze > line draw tool > draw line joining centroids of sister kinetochores > analyze > measure > export fluorescent intensities values as MS Excel spreadsheet for further analyses. Inter-kinetochore distance is measured using Fiji in 2D. Consider only those cells for quantification that have a tightly formed metaphase plate and in which most kinetochore pairs are aligned almost parallel to the spindle axis (the line connecting the two spindle poles). This is indicative of the late metaphase stage, where most kinetochores have captured microtubules and sufficient inter-kinetochore tension has been generated. Select a single z-plane containing the highest number of visibly brightest CREST signals by moving across the z-stack. Select the line draw tool from the Analyse tab on the Fiji menu bar and draw a straight line joining the centroids of a pair of kinetochores on the sister chromatids. This is illustrated in Figure 4 . The morphological features that characterize mammalian kinetochores are a faint, comet-like tail of CREST intensity connecting the two kinetochores. A pair of sister kinetochores (located on sister chromatids) is determined by moving through the z-stack. Adjacent CREST signals that come into and go out of focus in the same frame while moving through the z-stack are presumed to be a pair and therefore may be considered for distance measurements. The distance between the pair of kinetochores is measured by selecting the Analyze > Measure tool on the Fiji menu bar. This generates a data sheet for inter-kinetochore distance in micrometers and can be exported as an MS Excel spreadsheet. Twenty pairs of kinetochores per cell over a total of 20 cells per replicate are analyzed in this manner to obtain statistically significant data. The distance measurements between kinetochore pairs from a set of experiments are plotted as a scatter plot using the GraphPad Prism software. Figure 4. Quantification of inter-kinetochore distance in 2D using Fiji image analysis software. The window on the far left is the confocal micrograph showing kinetochores (pseudo-colored in magenta). A line connecting the centers of each pair of kinetochores (ROI) is drawn using the line tool (red box). The yellow dotted box highlights the representative lines drawn to connect the centers of two kinetochores, whose inset represents the zoomed form. Each ROI is added to the ROI manager (window on the far right) for calculating the inter-kinetochore distance. Quantification of SAC protein(s) at the kinetochore in 3D A flowchart depicting fluorescence intensity measurement steps in 3D is shown in Figure 2 . The IMARIS software suite is used for fluorescence quantification of SAC proteins at the kinetochore. Launch the IMARIS software suite and open the acquired images using the Open tab on the menu bar as indicated in Figure 5 (yellow box). A window containing all the acquired images appears. Open the image file from the list in the dialogue box as shown in figure 6 . Upon opening the selected image file, a 3D rendered image containing the xyz coordinates and all channels for that image (405 nm, 488 nm, 594 nm, and 647 nm) is displayed as below ( Figure 7 ). Since channels for DAPI (405 nm) and microtubules (594 nm) are not considered for quantification of SAC proteins at the kinetochore, turn off these channels. Now, only signals for CREST in magenta (594 nm) and Mad1 (SAC protein) in green (488 nm) are displayed ( Figure 8 ). Select the Crop 3D option from the menu bar for cropping a cell in 3D. Carefully select the cell of interest using the selection tool, ensuring the exclusion of unwanted neighboring or background cells. Apply the cropping function by clicking OK to display only the 3D-cropped image ( Figure 9 ). Select the Spot function tab and press add new spot button as indicated in Figure 10 (yellow box). Once the Spot function is activated, a new window appears, as indicated in Figure 10 (yellow box). Figure 5. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the IMARIS software suite. The yellow dotted box and inset show the menu bar functions for opening the confocal image files for initiating the analysis. Figure 6. GUI of the IMARIS software suite showing the acquired confocal image files, enabling the user to select an image for analysis and open the selected file from the displayed dialogue box (yellow dotted box). Figure 7. 3D reconstruction of the acquired confocal image displaying the xyz spatial coordinates and fluorescence channel information: Mad1 (green), CREST (magenta), DAPI (blue), and microtubules (red). Figure 8. 3D cropping of the selected image. Click the edit button on the menu bar and click on the Crop 3D button from the dropdown menu for cropping the cell of interest in 3D. This function retains the x, y, z information of the selected image upon cropping. Figure 9. 3D cropping of the selected image. The white dotted box represents the region containing the cell of interest to be cropped in 3D. The OK button at the bottom right (yellow dotted box) enables the cropping of the cell of interest. Figure 10. Activating the spot function on the IMARIS GUI The channel for CREST (magenta) is selected, and the spot size of 0.45 μm is designated for kinetochores of HeLa cells. Also, the background subtraction box is checked to ensure that the software automatically subtracts the background fluorescence in the processed image ( Figure 11 ). Figure 11. Assigning the spot size for kinetochores. Kinetochores are assigned a spot size of 0.45 μm in the selected channel for CREST (magenta) in HeLa cells. The average size may be empirically determined for individual cell lines using several control kinetochores across multiple cells to capture the CREST (kinetochore) signal and the signal of the loaded kinetochore SAC protein. The software automatically picks CREST-positive spots and displays them as grey balls. Spurious spots may also be occasionally picked by the software but can be manually deleted by adjusting the slider for the intensity ( Figure 12 , yellow inset box at the bottom). Conversely, spots that are clearly identified as kinetochores but may have been missed by the software can be added manually using the slider shown in the yellow dotted box in Figure 12 . Figure 12. Kinetochore spots of 0.45 μm diameter as rendered in grey by the spot function on IMARIS. The yellow dotted box displays the interactive slider for selectively removing non-specific spots. Once all kinetochores have been selected, click the Next button to convert the grey spots to magenta as indicated in Figure 13 . Figure 13. Finalizing the selected kinetochore spots. Click the statistical spreadsheet button followed by the detailed option button to simultaneously obtain the intensity sum values for the selected kinetochores (CREST) as well as the SAC protein loaded on the kinetochores (Mad1) ( Figure 14 , yellow dotted box). Figure 14. Fluorescence intensity sum values of the CREST and Mad1 channels are displayed in the yellow dotted box. Integrated intensity sum values for each spot for CREST and Mad1 are exported as an MS Excel spreadsheet for further calculations, as indicated in Figure 15 . Figure 15. Screenshot of MS Excel spreadsheet displaying the quantified integrated fluorescence intensity measurements extracted for CREST and Mad1 as measured by IMARIS. For quantifying the level of Mad1 at the kinetochore, the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of Mad1:CREST is calculated for each spot by dividing the fluorescence intensity of Mad1 by that of CREST. These values are then sorted from high to low and the top 20 kinetochore intensity values are considered for each cell. These calculations are performed for at least 20 cells per replicate to obtain robust, statistically significant data. Quantification of inter-kinetochore distance in 3D Import the acquired raw image file into the IMARIS software suite. Access the file menu located in the upper left corner. Click on Open file to open the confocal image files containing all the acquired images and select and open the individual z-image to be quantified (single confocal plane). Click the OK button to open the selected image (yellow box, Figure 16 ). Figure 16. IMARIS GUI displaying the confocal image file containing all acquired images. An individual image can be selected and opened by clicking on the image followed by clicking OK. Select the Slice mode from the software menu bar. Since only the kinetochore channel (CREST, 647 nm) is required for quantification of inter-kinetochore distances, turn off all the other channels by un-checking the individual boxes as shown in Figure 17 (yellow dotted box). Figure 17. The presented image depicts a 2D confocal microscopy reconstruction, visualized using x, y, and z spatial coordinates. The image displays various fluorophore markers: Mad1 (green), CREST (magenta), DAPI (blue), and microtubules (red). Crop the cell of interest by selecting Crop 3D from the Edit button on the menu bar as described in step E5. Zoom into the chosen metaphase cell such that the individual kinetochores are clearly visible. The morphological features that characterize mammalian kinetochores are a faint, comet-like tail of CREST intensity connecting the two kinetochores. A pair of kinetochores of sister chromatids is determined by moving through the z-stack. Adjacent CREST signals that come into and go out of focus at the same time while moving through the z-stack are presumed to be a pair and therefore may be considered for distance measurement ( Figure 18 ). Figure 18. The yellow box depicts a metaphase cell containing pairs of sister kinetochores aligned at the metaphase plate Click on the center of each kinetochore pair. A line joining the two sister kinetochores appears as shown in Figure 19 . The inter-kinetochore distance (here, 0.922 μm) appears in the dialogue bar in the upper-left corner (yellow box). Repeat for each kinetochore pair for all experimental conditions and record the values in an MS Excel spreadsheet. A minimum of 20 kinetochore pairs from each cell and 20 cells from each replicate are measured to obtain statistically significant data. Figure 19. A specific z-plane is identified where two CREST spots from a pair of kinetochores are clearly discernible within the yellow dotted box. This z-plane is selected for the quantification of interkinetochore distance. The measured distance between the kinetochores of a pair is displayed in the box demarcated by the white dotted line (top left). The measurements obtained following the described method are represented as a scatter plot using the GraphPad Prism software.\n\nValidation of protocol Validation of quantitative analyses of fluorescence intensity The methods described in this paper are widely accepted and have been used in the fields of kinetochore and mitosis biology for over twenty years [2, 5–8, 12–15]. However, users of either method may choose to cross-validate them. For instance, data using 2D quantification [13] and 3D quantification [6,7] of SAC proteins (Zw10, Mad1) upon depletion of the same gene (hLIC1) in the same cell type (HeLa) show reproducible phenotypes across the two methods.",

    "title": "Isolation of Viral Biofilms From HTLV-1 Chronically Infected T Cells and Integrity Analysis.",
    "abstract": "The human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic retrovirus that predominantly spreads through cell-to-cell contact due to the limited infectivity of cell-free viruses. Among various modes of intercellular transmission, HTLV-1 biofilms emerge as adhesive structures, polarized at the cell surface, which encapsulate virions within a protective matrix. This biofilm is supposed to facilitate simultaneous virion delivery during infection. Yet, the molecular and functional intricacies of viral biofilms remain largely unexplored, despite their pivotal role in understanding retroviral pathogenesis. In this study, we optimized a protocol to isolate HTLV-1 biofilms from chronically infected T cells, facilitating their structural and molecular characterization using proteomic and super-resolution microscopy analyses. This protocol involves cultivating HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells at high density to facilitate the natural detachment of viral biofilms into the supernatant. Then, employing successive centrifugations, the cells are separated from the detached biofilms, and these structures are pelleted at medium speed (10,000× g). This method circumvents the need for mechanical, chemical, or enzymatic biofilm detachment, bypasses the use of ultracentrifugation, and enables us to resuspend the biofilms in the appropriate buffer for subsequent analyses such as western blotting or super-resolution microscopy imaging as presented. Key features • Isolation of viral biofilms from HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells after 4 days of culture at high cellular density. • Structural analysis of viral biofilms using super-resolution microscopy techniques. • Experiments performed in vitro within a confined biosafety level 3 (BSL3) environment. • This protocol requires at least five days to complete.",

The cell suspension (stock culture) is regularly amplified and stored at -150 °C in cryotubes containing fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented with 10% DMSO. Cells need to be thawed and put in culture at least one week prior to the experiment. Prepare complete RPMI medium: RPMI 10% FCS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S). Warm complete RPMI medium and PBS at 37 °C using a water bath. Pellet HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells from a stock culture at 1,000× g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 10 mL of PBS in a 50 mL falcon tube (wash). Spin the cell suspension at 1,000× g for 5 min. Resuspend cells at a concentration of 0.5 × 10 6 cells/mL in 4 mL of complete RPMI medium. Transfer the homogenized suspension into a T25 cm 3 flask. Incubate the flask vertically at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 for 96 h ( Figure 1A ). Note: The doubling time of the C91-PL cell line is 3 days. After 4 days of incubation at high cellular density (0.5 × 10 6 cells/mL), the cell count reaches approximately 1.25 million cells in 1 mL and therefore a total of 5 million cells in 4 mL. Figure 1. Isolation of HTLV-1 biofilms from chronically infected T cells. A. Protocol for isolation of viral biofilms from chronically infected T cells (C91-PL). C91-PL cells were maintained in culture for 96 h to allow natural biofilm detachment in the supernatant. Step 1: Cells and large cellular debris were removed from the suspension by centrifugation at 1,000× g . Step 2: Biofilm isolation proceeded at 10,000× g . Step 3: Centrifugation at 100,000× g did not pellet more biofilms. B. Immunoblot probed for HTLV-1 Gagp19 showing Gag expression in viral biofilms isolated at 10,000× g (2) or 100,000× g (3). Biofilm isolation using sequential centrifugations Note: The centrifugation speeds that were tested (10,000 × g and 100,000 × g) to pellet viral biofilms are described below. After 96 h of incubation, collect and split the cell suspension (without mixing) in two Eppendorf tubes of 2 mL. Spin at 1,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells and clarify the supernatant ( Figure 1A .1). Collect the supernatants (1) and transfer them into two new Eppendorf tubes of 2 mL. Spin the supernatants (1) at 10,000× g for 40 min at 4 °C ( Figure 1A .2). Collect the supernatants (2) and transfer them into two open-top thin wall ultra-clear tubes of 5 mL. In parallel, keep the 10,000× g pellets (2) for subsequent analyses. For western blot, resuspend the pellets in a total volume of 60 μL of PBS with 0.2% Triton. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and store at 4 °C. Spin the supernatants (2) at 100,000× g for 90 min at 4 °C ( Figure 1A .3). Discard the supernatants and keep the 100,000× g pellets (3) for subsequent analyses. For the western blot, identical pellets are pooled and resuspended in a total volume of 60 μL of PBS with 0.2% Triton. Incubate for 10 min at RT and store at 4 °C. Keep samples at 4 °C for short-term storage (1 week) or -20 °C for long-term storage (several months). Detection of isolated biofilms using western blot Note: Prepare a 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel topped by a 4% stacking gel (see Recipes). All membrane incubation steps are performed under gentle agitation on a lab rocker. Prepare each sample by mixing in new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes: 5 μL of biofilm suspension (10,000× g or 100,000× g fractions) 4 μL of Laemmli SDS 4× buffer 7 μL of Milli-Q H 2 O Boil samples at 95 °C for 5 min. Spin samples at 500× g for 1 min. Load 4 μL of the prestained protein ladder into the first well of the electrophoresis gel. Load 16 μL of each sample into the following wells. Run migration at 80 V until the samples reach the stacking gel. Run migration at 100 V until the samples reach the end of the running gel. Pre-wet a PVDF membrane in methanol for 10 min (activation) and briefly rinse in transfer buffer. Transfer the separated proteins onto the activated PVDF membrane using the wet transfer method at 400 mA for 1 h. Incubate the membrane in 10 mL of TBST buffer supplemented with 5% milk for 30 min (membrane saturation). Transfer the membrane in the primary antibody mix containing: 3 mL of 5% milk in TBS-T buffer 3 μL (1:1000) anti-HTLV-1 Gagp19 primary mouse antibody Incubate overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Wash the membrane three times in 5% milk in TBS-T buffer for 10 min under gentle agitation. Transfer the membrane in the secondary antibody mix containing: 10 mL of 5% milk in TBS-T buffer 3.3 μL (1:3,000) anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody Incubate at RT for 2 h under gentle agitation. Wash the membrane three times in TBST buffer for 10 min under gentle agitation. Reveal the membrane using the ECL prime kit (Amersham) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Image the revealed membrane ( Figure 1B ) with the ChemiDoc imaging system using the following parameters: Select Chemiluminescence mode. Set the exposure time manually to 1s. Note: If your signal is too weak to be detected with 1 s of exposure, select “Rapid Auto-exposure.” Data analysis (Western blot): HTLV-1 Gagp19 proteins were detected in pellets obtained at 10,000× g ( Figure 1B .2) by western blot, demonstrating that viral material has successfully been isolated with this speed. Gagp19 proteins were not detected at 100,000× g by western blot, suggesting that most viral biofilms were pelleted at centrifugation speeds ≤ 10,000× g . Therefore, 10,000× g speed was used to pellet viral biofilms for the following analyses (super-resolution microscopy). Analysis of isolated biofilms using super-resolution STED microscopy Note: To confirm the successful isolation of HTLV-1 biofilms, we chose to analyze the viral material pelleted at 10,000 × g using stimulated emission-depletion (STED) fluorescence microscopy. This technique allows us to go below 100 nm in x, y resolution and therefore decipher the spatial organization of individual viral particles, measure their diameter, and check if they successfully incorporated viral markers (i.e., Env glycoproteins) ( Figure 3 ). Electroporation of the pGag-YFP plasmid into HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells To visualize viral particles, we electroporated HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells with a DNA construct encoding the fluorescent HTLV-1 Gag-YFP protein, which is incorporated into the nascent virions ( Figure 2A ). This electroporation protocol was optimized for 8 × 10 6 cells mixed with 10 μg of plasmids. Warm Opti-MEM (1×) reduced serum medium and PBS at 37 °C using a water bath. Pellet HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells from a stock culture at 1,000× g for 5 min. Resuspend cells in 10 mL of PBS in a 50 mL Falcon tube. Spin the cell suspension at 1,000× g for 5 min (wash). Count and resuspend cells at a concentration of 2 × 10 7 cells/mL in 1 mL of Opti-MEM medium. Add 10 μg of pHTLV-1 Gag-YFP plasmids. Mix gently by pipetting up and down using a P1000 pipette. Transfer 400 μL of this cell suspension (= 8 × 10 6 cells) into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Mix again gently by pipetting up and down using a P1000 pipette. Transfer the mix into a 0.4 cm electroporation cuvette. Place the cuvette into the pod of the Gene Pulser Xcell electroporation system. Use the following electroporation program: Voltage: 180 V Pulse length: 10 ms Number of pulses: 3 Time between pulses: 1 s Press the red Pulse button to start the program. Wait until the electroporation ( Figure 2A ) is completed (a few seconds). Transfer 200 μL of the cell suspension into 4 mL of prewarmed RPMI 10% FCS without P/S in a 10 mL Falcon tube. Mix gently by pipetting up and down using a P1000 pipette. Divide the cell suspension into two wells of a 6-well plate (volume per well = 2 mL). Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 for 96 h. Note: The doubling time of the C91-PL cell line is 3 days. After 4 days of incubation at high cellular density (0.5 × 10 6 cells/mL), the cell count reaches approximately 1.25 million cells in 1 mL and therefore a total of 5 million cells in 4 mL. 60% of these cells die from the lack of nutrients, which allows spontaneous viral biofilm release. Figure 2. Electroporation of HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells with a plasmid encoding HTLV-1 Gag-YFP fluorescent proteins. A. Scheme: Electroporation of HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells (C91-PL) with a plasmid encoding HTLV-1 Gag-YFP. Gag-YFP(+) biofilms isolated at 10,000× g are then plated on a poly-L-lysine-coated fluorodish for immunofluorescence staining and STED imaging (see below). B. Representative confocal microscopy images of living Gag-YFP(+) chronically infected T cells. Each image is a projection of 10 successive optical z-slices of 1 μm. These images show the successful accumulation of Gag-YFP(+) virions (yellow) at the cell surface 24 h post-electroporation. Scale bars = 10 μm. Remark: We confirmed in Arone et al. [12] that Gag-YFP proteins were successfully incorporated into Gag WT(+) and Env WT(+) virions. This demonstrates that the YFP fluorescent signal reflects wild-type virion accumulation into HTLV-1 biofilms (DOI: 10.1128/mbio.01326-23). Isolation and plating of Gag-YFP+ biofilms for super-resolution microscopy imaging After 96 h of incubation, transfer each well into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes (without mixing). Spin them at 1,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells ( Figure 1A .1) and clarify the supernatant. Collect the supernatants and transfer them into two new Eppendorf tubes of 2 mL. Spin the supernatants at 10,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet viral biofilms as in Figure 1A .2. Discard the supernatants, resuspend, and pool pellets containing biofilms in a total volume of 60 μL of TNE buffer for storage. Note: At this point, you can keep the samples at 4 °C for short-term storage (1 week) or -20 °C for long-term storage (several months). Note: The percentage of cells that dissociates their biofilm is very challenging to estimate. On one hand, even if HTLV-1 chronically infected T cells are releasing biofilms, viral aggregates can still be detected at the cell surface (they are continuously producing viral particles/biofilms), so we cannot discriminate between cells that have “lost their biofilms” and cells that did not. On the other hand, not every cell carries a biofilm at a given timepoint, and these structures are variable in size. Coat glass-bottom fluorodishes with poly-L-lysine using the following steps: i. Add 500 μL of PBS containing 0.01% poly-L-lysine in the center of a fluorodish using a P1000 pipette. ii. Incubate for 30 min at RT. iii. Remove the poly-L-lysine coating solution. iv. Wash the bottom of the fluorodish by gently adding and removing 500 μL of PBS. v. Repeat the washing step three times. vi. Remove all residual PBS. Transfer 30 μL of the Gag-YFP(+) biofilms previously isolated into a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf. Add 470 μL of TNE buffer and gently mix by pipetting up and down to dilute the biofilm suspension. Transfer the mix (total volume = 500 μL) in the poly-L-lysine coated fluorodish ( Figure 2 ). Incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark to let the biofilms adhere to the coated glass. Add 1.5 mL of TNE buffer and proceed to the fixation and staining steps (see below). Staining of Gag-YFP+ biofilms for stimulated emission-depletion (STED) microscopy: Note: STED microscopy principle: Using a depletion beam with a “donut-shaped” intensity profile, fluorophore emission can be selectively silenced in the periphery of an excited spot, thus effectively reducing the area of detected fluorescence, and improving the lateral resolution. This allows the detection of individual viral particles in biofilms. Once biofilms have adhered to the coated glass ( Figure 2 ), remove the TNE buffer. Add 500 μL of PFA buffer (fixation). Incubate for 15 min at RT. Remove PFA and add 500 μL of freshly prepared 50 mM NH 4 Cl (quenching). Incubate for 5 min at RT. Remove NH 4 Cl and add 1 mL of PBS (wash). Remove PBS and add 1 mL of PBS containing 0.05% saponin and 3% BSA (permeabilization/saturation buffer). Incubate for 15 min at RT. Remove permeabilization/saturation buffer and add the primary antibody mix containing: i. 200 μL of permeabilization/saturation buffer ii 1 μL (1:200) anti-YFP primary rabbit antibody iii. 2 μL (1:100) anti-HTLV-1 Envgp46 primary mouse antibody Incubate for 90 min at RT. Remove the primary antibody mix. Wash the sample by gently adding and removing 1 mL of permeabilization/saturation buffer. Repeat the washing step three times. Remove permeabilization/saturation buffer and add the secondary antibody mix containing: i. 200 μL of permeabilization/saturation buffer ii. 2 μL (1:100) anti-rabbit IgG STAR 580 secondary antibody iii. 2 μL (1:100) anti-mouse IgG STAR Red secondary antibody Incubate for 90 min at RT in the dark. Remove the secondary antibody mix. Wash the sample by gently adding and removing 1 mL of PBS buffer. Repeat the washing step three times. Keep the sample in 2 mL of PBS at 4 °C in the dark until STED imaging ( Figure 3A ). Figure 3. Imaging fluorescent HTLV-1 biofilms using super-resolution STED microscopy. A. Representative STED microscopy images of fixed Gag-YFP(+) biofilms pelleted at 10,000× g and stained for the viral envelope protein (Env). Scale bars = 500 nm. B. The white cross-section, shown in A, is plotted next to the corresponding image (left graph) where the three yellow peaks correspond to individual viral particles (FWHM = 148 nm, 150 nm, and 144 nm). The right plot shows the FWHM distribution of n = 25 cross-sections of Gag-YFP(+) particles and represents the distribution of particles’ diameter. FWHM: full width at half maximum of the Gag-YFP fluorescent signal peak, measured using Spectragryph software. SD: standard deviation of the mean. Imaging parameters (STED): Dual-color STED 2D images ( Figure 3B ) were acquired on an STED microscope equipped with a 100× oil objective using 580 nm (Star-Orange) and 630 nm (Star-Red) excitation laser sources, coupled with a pulsed 775 nm STED laser. Using 25% of STED laser power, we could obtain a lateral resolution of less than 100 nm. All images were processed with ImageJ software. (DOI: 10.1128/mbio.01326-23.) Image analysis (STED): Using STED microscopy, we were able to detect Gag-YFP(+) structures in the 10,000× g isolates ( Figure 3A ). As shown in the representative images in Figure 3A , Gag-YFP(+) signal corresponds to spherical individual particles with a mean diameter (calculated with the full width at half maximum, FWHM, of the fluorescent peak) of 174 nm ± 19 nm ( Figure 3B ).\nThis size is consistent with the diameter of HTLV-1 virions measured by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy [15]. Moreover, Gag-YFP(+) viral particles successfully incorporated Env glycoproteins ( Figure 3A ): most Gag-YFP(+) viral cores were in close vicinity with Env signal, which was confirmed in Arone et al. [12]. Although some particles did not exhibit Env glycoproteins at their surface, it is known that HTLV-1 particles contain variable numbers of Env molecules, most of which are unevenly distributed in the viral lipidic envelope [16].\nOverall, our results demonstrate the successful isolation of HTLV-1 biofilms containing unaltered Gag(+)/Env(+) viral particles. These isolated biofilms were also analyzed using atomic force microscopy and mass spectrometry by Arone et al. [12].\n\nValidation of protocol The protocol has been successfully employed in various studies in the lab, as well as in our most recent publication (Arone et al. [12], DOI: 10.1128/mbio.01326-23; Figure 1 , Figure 2 ). In this study, HTLV-1 biofilms were isolated using this protocol and processed by mass spectrometry to do a large-scale identification of biofilm components.",

    "title": "Imaging of estrogen receptor-α in rat pial arterioles using a digital immunofluorescent microscope.",
    "abstract": "Many of estrogen's effects on vascular reactivity are mediated through interaction with estrogen receptors (1, 2, 3). Although two sub-types exist (estrogen receptor -α and β),estrogen receptor-α has been identified in both the smooth muscle and in endothelial cells of pial arterial segments using fluorescent staining combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (4). Furthermore, ER-α is located in the nuclei and in the cytoplasm of rat basilar arteries (5). The receptors are abundant and fluoresce brightly, but clear visualization of discrete groups of receptors is difficult likely due to the numbers located in many cell layers of pial vessel segments. Additionally, many reports using immunohistochemical techniques paired with confocal microscopy poorly detail the requirements critical for reproduction of experiments (6). Our purpose for this article is to describe a simple technique to optimize the staining and visualization of ER-α using cross-sectional slices of pial arterioles obtain from female rat brains. We first perfuse rats with Evans blue dye to easily identify surface pial arteries which we isolate under a dissecting microscope. Use of a cryostat to slice 8 μm cross sections of the arteries allows us to obtain thin vessel sections so that different vessel planes are more clearly visualized. Cutting across the vessel rather than use of a small vessel segment has the advantage of easier viewing of the endothelial and smooth muscle layers. In addition, use of a digital immunofluorescent microscope with extended depth software produces clear images of ten to twelve different vessel planes and is less costly than use of a confocal laser scanning microscope.",
    "methods": "Protocol 1. Isolation and Preparation of Pial Arteries While the rat is anesthetized insert and secure a catheter into an artery and perfuse with 1% Evans blue in 1X PBS. Pial vessels stain well with the Evans blue dye making them easier to isolate. Extract the brain and store at -70°C until needed. Optimally, brains should be stored no longer than 2 months. Using a dissecting microscope remove pial arterioles (average diameter 35-50 μm) from the surface of the brain . Carefully pull off all the blue-stained arterioles from dorsal and lateral the surface of the cortex using fine- tipped forceps. Remove excess adherent cortical tissue before placing in the fixative. Fix the harvested arterioles in 2% cold paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS for 30 min. To prepare the arterioles for sectioning pour embedding medium on the freezing disc/chuck (set at -20°C). Place arteriole section flat on the chuck and wait for it to freeze. Firmly place the vessel up-right on the cryostat freezing disc on embedding media with the tip of the artery facing you. Hold it with tweezers until it is solidly frozen. Place the freezing disc with the vessel into the cryostat head and cut 8 μm pial arteriole rings with the cryostat. Mount the arteriole sections on chromium-potassium-gelatin subbed slides. Store the prepared slides in a slide box in the refrigerator at 4°C overnight. 2. ER-α Immunofluorescent Staining Day 1 Remove the slides from the refrigerator; bring each to room temperature. To wash the slides pour 1-1.5 ml 0.1M PBS (enough to cover all the sections) let sit for 10 minutes, drain and repeat procedure twice more. Each edge of the slide has a hydrophobic marker. Consequently, the liquid remains on the surface of the slide. With each washing the liquid is poured out and replaced with fresh 0.1 M PBS. Incubate slides in 1 ml of 50mM ammonium chloride for 30 min at room temperature to reduce endogenous fluorescence. Wash the slides in 0.1M PBS 3x10 min. as described in 2.2 Block slides in 0.1% Triton-X 100 plus 1% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS for 30 min. to reduce non- specific binding. Incubate samples with the primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-ER-α; 1:500) in PBS + 0.1% Triton-X + 1% NGS overnight at 4°C. Day 2 Remove the slides from the refrigerator; bring each to room temperature. Wash the slides in 0.1M PBS 3x10 min. as described in 2.2 Incubate with Oregon Green 488 secondary anti-rabbit in 1% NGS +0.1%Triton-X100 + PBS for 2 hour in the dark at room temperature. From this step, the next steps must be done in the dark. Wash the slides in 0.1M PBS 3x10 min. as described in 2.2 Under a ventilated hood, place 1 drop of 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) plus mounting media on the vessels and then place a cover slip over the sample. Apply clear nail polish to seal the edges of the cover slip. Do not move the slides until completely dry, which takes approximately 24 hours. 3. Digital Fluorescence Imaging For imaging ER-α in the pial vessel slice we use a Nikon Eclipse 80i digital fluorescent microscope with filters for 3 colors (blue, green and red) equipped with a digital camera. Insert the prepared slides with the stained pial vessel segments under the microscope and adjust to visualize the fluorescently labeled areas of interest. Start at x100 magnification then increase to x600 magnification. Use the camera to capture images in DAPI (blue) and FITC (green) channels for cell nuclei (DAPI) and ER-α (Oregon Green) using Nikon Extended Depth Focus software to convert multiple views of vessel segments into 2-D images. 4. Representative Results: We localized estrogen receptor-α in pial arterial vessels using fluorescent probes and optimized our visualization of the receptor using digital fluorescence microscopy. To detect the presence of the receptor, a rabbit polyclonal primary antibody and an Oregon Green 488 labeled secondary antibody was used to image the receptors in pial arteries isolated from the surface of the brain. Also, a nuclear stain (DAPI) was used to identify the cell nuclei and determine if we could detect receptors located in the nucleus since ER-α has been reported to be present in the cell cyotosol and the nucleus. In addition, we conducted confirmatory experiments to validate the specificity of the primary antibody and to verify binding of the secondary to the primary antibody. Figure 1. Immunofluorescent staining for ER- α (green) and counterstaining with DAPI (blue) in a pial artery ring isolated from female rat brain. Fig 1A shows the merged images suggesting the presence of some intranuclear estrogen receptor-a (arrow). Fig 1B and 1C are the focused image of ER- α which is a combination of Z-stack images. Images were taken at x600 magnification and are from the cut ring of the same vessel in different planes. Arrows indicate estrogen receptor- α. Figure 2. Immunofluorescent staining for control groups in a pial artery ring isolated from female rat brain. Fig 2D shows the vessel without primary antibody. Fig 2E shows the vessel without the secondary antibody (note distinct autofluorescence along endothelial side). Images were taken at x600 magnification and are from the cut ring of the same vessel in different planes.",

    "title": "FLARE: A Flow Cytometry-Based Fluorescent Assay for Measuring HSV-1 Nuclear Egress.",
    "abstract": "During herpesvirus replication, capsids are assembled inside the nucleus and translocated into the cytosol by a non-canonical nucleocytoplasmic export process termed nuclear egress. Traditional methods of measuring nuclear egress rely on imaging-based technologies such as confocal and electron microscopy. These techniques are labor-intensive, limited by the number of cells that can be examined, and may not accurately represent the entire population, generating a potential bias during data interpretation. To overcome these problems, we have developed a flow cytometry-based method to measure HSV-1 nuclear egress that we termed FLARE (FLow cytometry-based Assay of nucleaR Egress). This assay uses a double fluorescent reporter system, utilizing HSV-1-tdTomato to identify infected cells and an Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated, capsid-specific antibody to detect cytosolic capsids, thereby distinguishing infected cells with nuclear egress from those without it. This assay provides more quantitative results than traditional methods, enables large-scale high throughput, and can be adapted for use with other herpesviruses. Key features • Quantification of HSV-1 nuclear egress by flow cytometry using a double fluorescent reporter system. • The assay is suitable for large-scale high-throughput screens, e.g., CRISPR/Cas9. • The assay can be adapted for use with other herpesviruses, provided a mature capsid-specific antibody is available.",

Cell counter slides (Thermo Scientific, catalog number: C10228 )\n\nProcedure A. Before experiments (BSL-2) 1. Maintain HeLa cells in 10-cm culture dishes at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Keep cell density between 1 million/dish and 15 million/dish. Prepare and keep the stock of HSV-1 virus at -80 °C. B. Day 1: Cell seeding (BSL-2) 1. Retrieve HeLa cells from the incubator. Aspirate the supernatant and wash cells once with 5 mL of PBS. 2. Aspirate the PBS and add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin. Incubate cells for ~3 min at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 to allow cells to detach. 3. Resuspend cells in 8 mL of complete cell culture growth medium (see Recipe 1). 4. Pipette 25 μL of cell suspension into a centrifuge tube and mix with 25 μL of 0.4% trypan blue. Pipette 10 μL of this mixture into a cell counting slide. Measure the cell density with a cell counter. 5. Seed HeLa cells in a 6-well plate at a cell density of 200,000 cells/mL, with 2 mL of total volume per well. Incubate overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . 6. Label one well as “counting,” one well as “UC” (uninfected control), two wells as “HSV-1-tdTomato,” and two wells as “HSV-1-tdTomato-d34” (a control for the defect in nuclear egress) (see General notes 1 and 2). For any additional conditions, prepare 2 wells for each condition as desired. C. Day 2: Virus infection (BSL-2) 1. Retrieve the 6-well plate from the incubator. Aspirate the growth medium from the well labeled “counting” and wash once with 2 mL of PBS. 2. Aspirate the PBS and add 300 μL of 0.05% trypsin. Incubate cells for ~3 min at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 until all cells have detached. 3. Resuspend cells with 700 μL of growth medium. 4. Pipette 25 μL of resuspended cells into a centrifuge tube and mix with 25 μL of 0.4% trypan blue. Pipette 10 μL of the mixture into a cell counting slide and measure the cell density with a cell counter. Discard cells after counting. a. Target cell density should be between 4 and 8 × 10 5 cells/mL. 5. Calculate the amount of virus to use for the experiment based on the determined cell density. Virus should be made up in 1 mL of Opti-MEM media. a. For HSV-1-tdTomato, use a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. b. For HSV-1-tdTomato-d34, use an MOI of 10 (see General note 3). 6. Aspirate the supernatant from wells labeled “UC,” “HSV-1-tdTomato,” and “HSV-1-tdTomato-d34.” Infect cells with 300 μL of their respective viruses. For the UC, mock-infect cells using 300 μL of Opti-MEM media. Return the plate to the incubator. 7. Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 1 h, gently agitating the plate by hand every 15 min to distribute the virus evenly. 8. Following the 1 h infection, aspirate the supernatant and add 2 mL of growth medium into each well. Return the plate to the incubator. D. Day 3: Sample preparation for flow cytometry (before step 6: BSL-2; after step 6: BSL-1) 1. Twenty-four hours post-infection (hpi) (see General note 4), take the plate out of the incubator and aspirate the growth medium from each well. Wash cells once with 2 mL of PBS. 2. Aspirate the PBS and add 300 μL of 0.05% trypsin into each well. Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for ~3 min until all cells detach. 3. Resuspend cells with 300 μL of growth medium. 4. Pool and transfer cells infected with the same virus into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge cells at 500× g for 5 min at room temperature. Bleach the 6-well plates with 20% bleach. 5. Aspirate the supernatant, leaving the pellet intact. Fix cells by resuspending the cell pellet in 200 μL of 4% PFA for the UC-labeled tube (containing a 200 μL cell aliquot) and 400 μL of 4% PFA for the HSV-1-tdTomato- and HSV-1-tdTomato-d34-labeled tubes (containing 400 μL cell aliquots in each tube). Rock cells in PFA for 20 min at room temperature on a rocker set to low-to-medium speed. Pause point: (Optional) Fix cells overnight at 4 °C on a rocker set to low speed (see General note 5). 6. Prepare samples for membrane permeabilization. For the uninfected cell sample, transfer 100 μL of fixed cells into a new centrifuge tube labeled “UC.” For HSV-1-tdTomato and HSV-1-tdTomato-d34-infected cell samples, transfer 100 μL of fixed, infected cells into centrifuge tubes labeled as “2 ry only,” “Digitonin,” and “Triton X-100” for each virus. 7. Permeabilize cells for 30 min at room temperature by mixing 100 μL of cells with 100 μL of detergent by pipetting cells up and down 5–10 times without introducing any bubbles. a. For “UC” and “2 ry only” samples, permeabilize cells with 100 μL of 2× full membrane permeabilization solution (see Recipe 4). b. For “Digitonin” samples, permeabilize cells with 100 μL of 2× partial (plasma membrane) permeabilization solution (see Recipes 2 and 3). c. For “Triton X-100” samples, permeabilize cells with 100 μL of 2× full membrane permeabilization solution (see Recipe 4). Critical: The extent of permeabilization will influence the signal read out by flow cytometry (see General note 6). We do not recommend vortexing samples during permeabilization, as the use of greater mechanical force may over-permeabilize the cells, especially for partial permeabilization. 8. Block cells (200 μL) for 1 h at room temperature by adding 200 μL of 2× blocking buffer (see Recipe 5 and General note 7). 9. Add 100 μL of 5× primary antibody solution (see Recipe 6) into “UC,” “Digitonin,” and “Triton X-100” tubes for each virus. (Working concentration of the 8F5 mouse anti-VP5 antibody is 0.65 μg/mL.) Add 100 μL of blocking buffer into “2 ry only.” 10. Incubate cells in primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker set to low speed to ensure uniform antibody binding. Pause point: (Optional) Incubate cells in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C on a rocker set to low speed (see General note 8). 11. Following incubation with primary antibody, add 1,000 μL of PBS to each sample, bringing up the total volume to 1.5 mL. 12. Centrifuge samples at 500× g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant. Make sure not to disturb the pellet (see General note 9). 13. Resuspend cell pellets with 200 μL of secondary antibody solution (see Recipe 7). 14. Incubate samples at room temperature for 1 h on a rocker set to low speed to ensure uniform antibody binding. Pause point: (Optional) Incubate samples in secondary antibody overnight at 4 °C on a rocker set to low speed. 15. Process samples with flow cytometry.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: Dai et al. [17]. ER protein CLCC1 promotes nuclear envelope fusion in herpesviral and host processes. Nat Commun (Figure 1A and Extended Data Figure 1A–C). The same images were used for Figures 2 and 4 of this paper, alongside additional information provided in this protocol. Measuring nuclear egress infected with an HSV-1 mutant with a nuclear egress defect [17] To confirm the phenotype of our assay, we generated an HSV-1 mutant virus defective in nuclear egress, HSV-1-tdTomato-d34. In this mutant virus, the UL34 gene encoding one of the nuclear egress complex components is replaced by an ATGTCC sequence. Nuclear egress in HeLa cells infected with HSV-1-tdTomato-d34 is measured using the same procedure described for infection with HSV-1-tdTomato ( Figures 2 and 3 ). In tandem with flow cytometry experiments, confocal microscopy was performed in non-infected, HSV-1-tdTomato-infected, and HSV-1-tdTomato-d34-infected HeLa cells ( Figure 4 ). HSV-1-tdTomato-d34-infected cells exhibited ~10% nuclear egress compared to HSV-1-tdTomato-infected cells, where ~90% nuclear egress was observed ( Figure 3 ). Accordingly, by confocal microscopy, nuclear egress was observed in HSV-1-tdTomato- but not HSV-1-tdTomato-d34-infected cells under partial permeabilization conditions (digitonin treatment). As a control, cells were treated with Triton X-100 to confirm the presence of capsids in both HSV-1-tdTomato- and HSV-1-tdTomato-d34-infected cells. Figure 4. Confocal images validate the FLow cytometry–based Assay of nucleaR Egress (FLARE). Immunofluorescence images of cells permeabilized using the same conditions as in the FLARE assay. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates containing coverslips. The next day, cells were infected with either HSV-1-tdTomato or HSV-1-tdTomato-d34 mutant virus. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were either partially permeabilized with digitonin or fully permeabilized with Triton X-100 and then incubated with the capsid-specific (8F5) primary antibody and Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated secondary antibody. Conditions were the same as in Figure 2. Green = capsids, blue = nucleus, red = infection. Cells infected with HSV-1-tdTomato have only the cytoplasmic capsid signal (green) when permeabilized with digitonin (first row), but both nuclear and cytoplasmic signals when permeabilized with Triton X-100 (third row). Cells infected with HSV-1-tdTomato-d34 mutant, which has a nuclear egress defect, have no cytoplasmic capsid signal when permeabilized with digitonin (second row), but have nuclear signal when permeabilized with Triton X-100 (fourth row). Scale bar = 10 μm. Each image is representative of at least three biological replicates. Testing the efficacy of an anti-VP5 antibody As viral capsid proteins are first synthesized in ribosomes in the cytoplasm, we tested how much background signal was detected when using an antibody bound to free capsid proteins but not specific to the mature capsid. To address this, we used a 6F10 antibody, which binds its epitope on the major capsid protein VP5 (residues A862-H880) [18], in free or capsid-bound form. During infection with the HSV-1-tdTomato-d34 strain, under partial permeabilization conditions (digitonin), we observed a high percentage of double-positive cells in the 6F10-stained sample ( Figure 5 ). This confirmed that the free VP5 protein can be detected in the cytoplasm regardless of the nuclear egress. Therefore, the use of a capsid-specific antibody, i.e., an antibody that only binds a fully formed capsid but not a free capsid protein, is essential for the detection of nuclear egress in our assay. Figure 5. A capsid-specific antibody is required for the nuclear egress assay. (A) HeLa cells were infected with HSV-1-tdTomato-d34 (impaired nuclear egress) at an MOI of 10. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were fixed in 4% PFA and either partially (digitonin) or fully permeabilized (Triton X-100). Subsequently, cells were incubated with either an anti-VP5 (6F10) or the capsid-specific anti-VP5 (8F5) primary antibody and Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated secondary antibody. Signal was measured by flow cytometry, with cells plotted against Td-Tomato (Y-axis) and Alexa Fluor-488 (X-axis). Cells were gated as previously described. (B) Quantification of antibody specificity (TdTomato+/Alexa Fluor-488+, percent double-positive in digitonin over percent double-positive in Triton X-100) in HSV-1-tdTomato-d34-infected cells from three individual experiments. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Testing nuclear egress in other cell lines To broaden the applicability of our assay, we also performed it on Vero and Hep-2 cells, which are commonly used to study HSV-1 infection ( Figure 6 ). When comparing nuclear egress results during HSV-1-tdTomato and HSV-1-tdTomato-d34 infection, there is a significant difference observed in both Vero and Hep-2 infected cells. We conclude that our assay works for a variety of cell lines and would serve as a great tool to better study HSV-1 nuclear egress. Nonetheless, optimization may be required for other cell lines.",

    "title": "Fixation and Expansion Microscopy of Xenopus Egg Extract Spindles.",
    "abstract": "In vitro systems based on Xenopus egg extracts have elucidated many aspects of spindle assembly. Still, numerous unknowns remain, particularly concerning the variation in spindle morphologies. The X. laevis and X. tropicalis egg extract systems, which recapitulate diverse spindle sizes and architectures, serve as ideal tools to investigate the regulation of spindle morphometrics. However, fully understanding spindle architectural differences is hindered by the spindle's size and high microtubule density. Indeed, classical fluorescence microscopy lacks the resolution to detail the organization of spindle microtubules, and although electron tomography can distinguish individual microtubules, segmenting thousands of microtubules and tracking them across dozens of sections remains an unachieved challenge. Therefore, we set out to apply expansion microscopy to the study of Xenopus egg extract spindles. During this process, we realized that optimizing spindle fixation as well was crucial to preserve microtubule integrity. Here, we present an optimized fixation and expansion microscopy protocol that enables the study of spindle architecture in egg extracts of both X. laevis and X. tropicalis. Our method retains the fluorescence of rhodamine tubulins added to the extracts and allows for both pre- and post-expansion immunofluorescence analysis. Key features • Expansion of optimally fixed spindle assembled from egg extracts of X. leavis, X. tropicalis, and possibly others. • Retains the fluorescence of the rhodamine-tubulin that copolymerizes with endogenous Xenopus tubulin within spindle microtubules, allowing their imaging without immunolabeling. • Compatible with both pre- and post-expansion immunolabeling to increase labeling possibilities. • Optimized spindle fixation that best preserves microtubule integrity for expansion and can also be used without expansion for regular immunofluorescence experiments.",

Take the spindle dilution buffer and spindle cushion buffer out of the fridge at least 2 h before spin-downs. 2. Prepare the PBSI. 3. Prepare the centrifugation setup: a. Place a Teflon adaptor inside a Kimble glass tube. b. Add 5 mL of room-temperature spindle cushion buffer, avoiding bubbles and without projecting on the tube wall. c. Place a 12 mm round coverslip inside the tube and make it settle on the Teflon adaptor. Note: If the coverslip floats, just touch it with forceps to make it sink. 4. When ready, take 20–50 μL of egg extract spindle reaction using a cut 200 μL pipette tip and add it to 1 mL of room-temperature spindle dilution buffer in a 1.5 mL tube. Note: The quantity of egg extract can vary based on how many eggs were laid, so the amount of extract in each reaction should be determined based on the total extract amount made and the planned experiments for the day [19,20]. 20–50 μL results in sufficient spindles for imaging and subsequent expansion. 5. Mix by inverting the tube a few times. 6. Layer the mix onto the cushion, pipetting using a cut 1 mL pipette tip ( Figure 2A ). Note: Be careful not to mix the two phases. Tilt the tube and make the extract/dilution buffer mixture slowly flow along the wall of the tube. Figure 2. Spindle spin-downs. (A) Centrifugation setup. The fixed extract sample (cloudy layer, yellow dashed line) should rest above the cushion buffer, while the coverslip (black dashed line) rests on the adaptor. (B) Usage of the metal hook to retrieve the coverslip (black dashed line) after centrifugation. (C) Fixation in cold methanol. (D) Rehydration in a humidifying and light-protected Petri dish by pipetting PBSI onto the coverslip (black dashed line). 7. Place the tube in the adapter rubber sleeve within the JS13-1 swinging rotor. 8. Centrifuge at 17,000× g for 15 min at 16 °C. B. Spindle fixation on the coverslip This is the most crucial step of the protocol for maintaining faithful microtubule structures; it has been optimized specifically for ExM. See General note 1 for further details before proceeding. 1. Right before the end of centrifugation: a. Prepare a Petri dish protected from light using aluminum foil and by putting parafilm on the bottom, as well as wet Kimwipes on its sides, so that it will stay humid. b. Get the metal hook (made from a syringe and bent needle, see Figure 1B ), a timer, and forceps ready. c. Prepare a fresh cold methanol bath by adding approximately 50 mL of -20 °C methanol at the very last moment in a 100 mL beaker. 2. Retrieve the coverslip using the metal hook and forceps ( Figure 2B ). 3. Dip the coverslip inside the cold methanol for 10 s ( Figure 2C ). See General note 1. 4. Take the coverslip from methanol and put it on parafilm, sample-side up. 5. Rehydrate immediately using 120 μL of PBSI ( Figure 2D ). 6. Wash 3 times with 120 μL of PBSI for 5 min and then twice with 120 μL of PBS. See Section G. Notes: 1. The protocol can be paused at this step for 1–3 days (such as over a weekend) by leaving the coverslip covered with 120 μL of PBS in the humid, light-protected Petri dish at 4 °C. 2. At this step, perform any immunofluorescence labeling of proteins of interest as described in [22]. 3. At this step, the coverslip can be imaged to observe spindles before expansion to control for quality or for correlation with post-expansion images to calculate the expansion factor or verify expansion quality (loss of signal or deformations) as described in Guilloux et al. [13]. C. Anchoring 1. Prepare the anchoring solution. 2. Cover the coverslip with 120 μL of anchoring solution. 3. Replace the solution with a new 120 μL of anchoring solution. 4. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature within the light-protected Petri dish. 5. During this time, prepare the denaturation buffer and the PBT and warm up the water bath to 95 °C. Make sure that the incubator is set to 37 °C. D. Gelation 1. Thaw the monomer solution and the 10× APS stock solution on ice. 2. Add 0.17 μL of TEMED to the 85 μL of monomer solution, flick well, and keep on ice. 3. Add 1.7 μL of 10× APS to the monomer solution, flick well, and keep on ice. 4. Remove as much anchoring solution as possible from the coverslip using vacuum aspiration. 5. Pipette the activated monomer solution up and down 3–4 times and make a 75 μL drop on the parafilm. 6. Retrieve the coverslip using forceps, maintaining vacuum aspiration ( Figure 3A ), and place it face down on the drop ( Figure 3B ). Figure 3. Gelation. (A) Coverslip (black dashed line) retrieved while aspirating. (B) Sample placed face down on the gelation solution. (C) Incubation in the dark without the humid Kimwipes and the lid slightly open. 7. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min. 8. Confirm the gelation by flicking the tube containing the rest of the activated gelation solution and remove the wet Kimwipes from the Petri dish. 9. Move the Petri dish to the 37 °C incubator and incubate for 30 min within the light-protected Petri dish only slightly open ( Figure 3C ). E. Denaturation 1. Using a metal spatula, retrieve the gel associated with the coverslip ( Figure 4A ) and transfer it to a light-protected glass Petri dish containing 5 mL of denaturation buffer, with the coverslip down and gel on top ( Figure 4B ). Figure 4. Denaturation. (A) Gel-associated coverslip to be retrieved (black dashed line). (B) Transfer to the denaturation solution. (C) Release of the gel and removal of the coverslip. (D) Incubation of the gel. Keep it in the dark with aluminum foil. (E) Water bath setup. The water bath is closed, protecting the gel from light and maintaining the temperature. 2. Quickly after, carefully remove the coverslip using a flat metal spatula ( Figure 4C ). 3. Take the coverslip out and add a few milliliters of denaturation buffer ( Figure 4D ). 4. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min. Note: If the room temperature is too low and the SDS precipitates from the denaturation buffer in the Petri dish, warm the dish up for a few seconds in the water bath and then keep the Petri dish near a heat source for the rest of the incubation. See General note 2. 5. Exchange the buffer for fresh denaturation buffer and move the glass dish to the 95 °C water bath, placing it at the water surface using a tube rack ( Figure 4E ). 6. Close the bath and incubate for 30 min. See General note 3. 7. Wash three times with at least 5 mL of PBT for 5 min at room temperature. 8. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature with Hoechst diluted to 20 μg/mL in PBT on the rotator. 9. Wash two times in PBS at room temperature. 10. Transfer the gel, sample-side up, to a light-protected 6-well plate filled with PBS and store at 4 °C until ready to expand. F. Expansion 1. Transfer the gel, sample-side up, to a glass Petri dish protected from light using aluminum foil ( Figure 5A ) and fill the dish with water (MilliQ). Figure 5. Expansion. (A) Gel after denaturation. (B) Gel after the first expansion in the 5 cm dish. (C) Gel after the second expansion in the 14 cm dish. Keep the gel protected from light at all times using aluminum foil. 2. Let the gel expand for 1 h, making sure that the gel is not sticking to the glass Petri dish. 3. Remove the water ( Figure 5B ), transfer the gel to a larger glass Petri dish (14 cm), and add fresh water (MilliQ). 4. Incubate the gel until fully expanded (30 additional minutes is usually sufficient), making sure that the gel is not sticking to the glass Petri dish by gently swirling the dish. The fully expanded gel should be approximately 4.5 cm in diameter ( Figure 5C ). See General note 2. Note: Alternatively, the second expansion can also be performed in a 5 cm dish to take advantage of its size as a proxy for full gel expansion. 5. The gel is ready for imaging ( Figure 5C ). See step G2. 6. When done with imaging, retrieve the gel in a glass Petri dish filled with PBS. 7. Incubate for about 30 min at room temperature to shrink the gel back. 8. Transfer the gel to a light-protected 6-well plate filled with fresh PBS and store it at 4 °C to re-expand and image it again later. Note: It can be useful to re-image a gel, for example, to acquire more structures. The gel preserves better when stored after shrinkage in PBS at 4 °C for (in our hands) up to 4 cycles of expansion/shrinkage without obvious alteration. Additionally, the shrunken form in PBS is necessary for post-expansion immunofluorescence [23]. G. Imaging See General note 4. 1. Pre-expansion imaging: a. Replace the PBS with PBS containing 10 μg/mL of Hoechst (Hoechst stock solution diluted 1:1,000 in PBS). b. Rinse twice with PBS. c. Seal the bottom side of the metal slide with a 12 mm round coverslip using warm Valap sealant. d. Fill the cavity with PBS. e. Mount the coverslip with spindles by putting it sample-side down ( Figure 6A ) and blotting the excess PBS using Kimwipes ( Figure 6B , C). f. Image using an upright microscope and air objective. g. Retrieve the coverslip by adding an excess of PBS ( Figure 6D ). Figure 6. Imaging setups. (A) Placing of the coverslip (black dashed line) on the PBS-filled chamber of the imaging metal slide. (B) Blotting away the excess PBS. (C) Final setup for pre-expansion imaging. (D) Addition of excess PBS floats the coverslip for retrieval after imaging. (E) Expanded gel (black dashed line) placed on taped glass slides, sample-side up. The entire gel can be mounted without cutting. (F) Addition of two large 24 mm × 60 mm coverslips (yellow dashed line) over the expanded gel. The setup is ready for upright post-expansion imaging. 2. Post-expansion imaging a. With an upright microscope, the whole gel can be mounted on two microscope slides taped together ( Figure 6E ). This allows screening of the entire gel, keeping its integrity and avoiding loss of structures of interest by cutting the gel to image it. i. To mount the gel, remove the water from the Petri dish. ii. Take the gel out using a metal spatula and put its side opposite to the sample on Kimwipes to dry it, which prevents it from moving when on the slide. iii. Transfer it to the double slide ( Figure 6E ). iv. Mount two large (24 mm × 60 mm) coverslips ( Figure 6F ) by slowly sliding them onto the gel surface, allowing any air bubbles to be pushed out. v. Image under air or water objectives. b. With an inverted microscope, pieces of gel can be mounted in a Poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottom dish to image spindles at higher resolution. i. Cut the gel into small pieces that would fit on the glass bottom of the dish. ii. Dry the gel pieces on Kimwipes. iii. Mount by gently pressing it, sample-face down, onto the Poly-d-lysine-coated glass. iv. Image using air or water objectives.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article(s): • Guilloux et al. [13]. Optimized expansion microscopy reveals species-specific spindle microtubule organization in Xenopus egg extracts. Molecular Biology of the Cell ( Figure 6A –D, Movie S1, Movie S2) Overall, close to 700 spindles were analyzed to develop this protocol, with particular emphasis on fixation, including 52 spindles from 4 egg extracts to validate the final protocol. Both expanded and non-expanded spindles were imaged, followed by careful measurements with multiple methods and metrics to calculate and characterize the increase in resolution and advantages of expansion microscopy. Measurements allowing to validate the protocol included assessing the variability of the expansion factor, the maintenance of fluorescence distribution along spindle length, and evaluating possible expansion-induced deformations (Guilloux et al. [13], Figures 2 –5, Supplemental Figures S3–S4).",

    "title": "Development of the Mammary Gland in Mouse: A Whole-Mount Microscopic Analysis.",
    "abstract": "The mammary gland undergoes functional, developmental, and structural changes that are essential for lactation and reproductive processes. An overview of such unique tissue can offer clearer insights into mammary development and tumorigenesis. Compared to traditional methods, mouse mammary gland whole mount is a pivotal technique that provides three-dimensional structural perspectives on gland morphology and developmental stages, offering an inexpensive and accessible approach. This protocol outlines the tissue isolation of the mouse mammary gland and provides detailed instructions for whole-mount staining and analysis. Mammary gland tissues are carefully dissected from euthanized mice and stained with Carmine Alum to highlight the ductal structures, enabling detailed visualization of the branching patterns and morphological changes. Light microscopy is used to capture a panoramic image of the stained mammary gland, enabling the quantitative analysis of terminal end buds (TEBs) and bifurcated TEBs to further investigate mammary gland remodeling. This method can provide invaluable insights, particularly in the study of mammary gland morphogenesis and tumorigenesis, underscoring its significance in both basic research and clinical applications. Key features • Monitor mammary gland development within 2 days using whole-mount staining.",

Secure the limbs of the mice to a foam board with pushpins. Using sterile scissors, make a skin incision on the abdomen and extend it toward the midline and hind limbs without breaching the peritoneum ( Figure 1A ). Figure 1. Isolation of mouse mammary gland tissue for whole-mount staining. A. The euthanized mouse is secured on a foam board, and its skin is incised along the midline (as indicated by the red line). B. The incised skin is pinned back to fully expose the fourth pair of mammary glands (as marked within the red circle). C. The entire mammary gland tissue is flattened on a glass slide. D. The glass slide is inserted into a centrifuge tube for staining. Securely pin the opened skin flat onto the foam board to adequately expose the fourth pair of mammary glands ( Figure 1B ). Gently grasp the distal end of the entire fat pads using sterile forceps and slowly remove the mammary glands from the skin using sterile scissors. For detailed steps, refer to the video \"Skin incision, removal of the mammary gland and spreading of the tissue onto glass slides\" in [5]. Transfer the entire tissue onto a glass slide and gently spread the tissue using forceps ( Figure 1C ). Place the glass slide at room temperature (RT) and allow the tissue edges to dry. After confirming that the tissue is securely adhered and not easily detached, transfer it into a 50 mL centrifuge tube for subsequent whole-mount staining ( Figure 1D ). Whole-mount staining Slowly add newly prepared Carnoy’s fixative to a 50 mL centrifuge tube, ensuring complete immersion of the entire mammary gland tissue in the chemical fume hood for 2–4 h or overnight at RT ( Figure 2A ). Figure 2. Process of whole-mount staining of mouse mammary gland tissue. A. The entire mammary gland tissue is fixed in Carnoy’s fixative. B. The entire mammary gland tissue is stained in Carmine Alum. C. The stained mammary gland tissue is cleared in xylene. D. The cleared mammary gland tissue is covered in neutral balsam. Transfer the glass slides to a 50 mL centrifuge tube for washing with 70% ethanol in the chemical fume hood for 15 min at RT. Mammary gland tissue processed in this step can be stored for several months. Pass the glass slides sequentially through 50% and 30% ethanol and ddH 2 O in the chemical fume hood for 5 min each at RT. Transfer the glass slides to Carmine Alum in the chemical fume hood at 4 °C overnight. Adjust staining duration based on the size and thickness of mammary gland tissue. Completed staining reveals a carmine-colored mammary epithelial tree and lymph node ( Figure 2B ). Wash the glass slides with wash buffer in the chemical fume hood at RT until the solution becomes clear. Pass the glass slides sequentially through 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol in the chemical fume hood for 15 min each at RT. Transfer glass slides to xylene for tissue clearing ( Figure 2C ) and mount them with Permount in the chemical fume hood at RT. Apply Permount or neutral balsam to cover the entire mammary gland tissue in the chemical fume hood ( Figure 2D ) and store at RT. Whole-mount analysis Capture images of the stained entire mammary gland tissue using a dissecting microscope ( Figure 3A ). Figure 3. Information from whole-mount analysis of mouse mammary gland tissue. A. The stained entire mammary gland tissue was captured by dissecting microscopy and contains information at different distances from the lymph node (scale bars, 2.5 mm). B–C. Images of TEBs (B) and bifurcated TEBs (C) were enlarged from the panoramic image (scale bars, 100 μm). Count the number of TEBs ( Figure 3B ) and bifurcated TEBs ( Figure 3C ) directly on the images using a counter. Count the number of ducts and acini at distances of 5, 10, and 15 mm from the lymph node along the direction of the mammary gland ( Figure 3A ).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article(s): Wang et al.

    "title": "Reconstitution of Membrane-tethered Postsynaptic Density Condensates Using Supported Lipid Bilayer.",
    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells utilize sub-cellular compartmentalization to restrict reaction components within a defined localization to perform specified biological functions. One way to achieve this is via membrane enclosure; however, many compartments are not bounded with lipid membrane bilayers. In the past few years, it has been increasingly recognized that molecular components in non- or semi-membrane-bound compartments might form biological condensates autonomously (i.e., without requirement of energy input) once threshold concentrations are reached, via a physical chemistry process known as liquid-liquid phase separation. Molecular components within these compartments are stably maintained at high concentrations and separated from the surrounding diluted solution without the need for a physical barrier. Biochemical reconstitution using recombinantly purified proteins has served as an important tool for understanding organizational principles behind these biological condensates. Common techniques include turbidity measurement, fluorescence imaging of 3D droplets, and atomic force microscopy measurements of condensate droplets. Nevertheless, many molecular compartments are semi-membrane-bound with one side attached to the plasma membrane and the other side exposed to the cytoplasm and/or attached to the cytoskeleton; therefore, reconstitution in 3D solution cannot fully recapture their physiological configuration. Here, we utilize a postsynaptic density minimal system to demonstrate that biochemical reconstitution can be applied on supported lipid bilayer (SLB); we have also incorporated actin cytoskeleton into the reconstitution system to mimic the molecular organization in postsynaptic termini. The same system could be adapted to study other membrane-proximal, cytoskeleton-supported condensations.",

Mix the following components in a glass vial: POPC (13.16 mM stock) 7.1 μL DGS-NTA (Ni) (4.74 mM stock) 0.42 μL PIP2 (500 μM stock) 3.9 μL PEG5000PE (170 μM stock) 0.57 μL Note that the above lipid quantities are calculated to coat a single cover glass well (i.e., 75 μg total). Dry the lipid mix under a stream of nitrogen gas with rotation. You will see multiple white layers adhered to the wall of the vial after the lipids are dried ( Figure 1 ). Note that 1% DiO perchlorate dye is included to label the lipids for a better visualization in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Image showing dried lipid layers adhered to the wall of a glass vial. 1% DiO dye is included to label the lipids for better demonstration. Continue to dry the lipids under vacuum for at least 1 h to ensure removal of residual chloroform. Resuspend the lipid mixture with vigorous pipetting and vortexing in ≤300 μL (the resuspension volume/the column injection volume is determined by the column resolution) of PBS buffer supplemented with 1% v/v sodium cholate. Lipids should be completely transparent once fully dissolved in detergent-containing buffer. Subject the dissolved lipid mixture to a HiTrap desalting column equilibrated with the detergent-free PBS buffer. Use an FPLC system and pool fractions with detected UV absorbance at 280 nm, followed by dilution to the desired volume with PBS buffer. Add 150 μL of lipid solution to coat each well glass to generate SLBs. Preparation of supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) Wash the chambered cover glass (well area of 0.7 cm 2 ) with 5% Hellmanex III overnight at room temperature and thoroughly rinse with Milli-Q water the next morning. Wash the cover glass with 5 M NaOH for 1 h at 50 °C and then rinse thoroughly with Milli-Q water. Repeat this wash step three times. To each cleaned cover glass, add 500 μL of PBS buffer for equilibration, take out, and discard. Add 150 μL of SUVs to each cover glass well and incubate for 1 h at 42 °C to generate SLBs. Wash the SLBs with 750 μL of reaction buffer three times to achieve 216-fold dilution. It should be noted that SLBs should not be exposed to the atmosphere to prevent oxidation. Block the SLBs with 1 mg/mL BSA (stock concentration of 100 mg/mL) in the reaction buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Add 2 μM 10% Alexa 647- or Cy3-labeled, His8-tagged PSD-95 protein to the SLBs and leave for incubation with SLBs for 1 h at room temperature. Wash away the unbound His-PSD-95 with the reaction buffer three times (750 μL per wash). Image using Zeiss LSM 800 microscope (Figure 2Ai). Imaging membrane localization of PIP2 binder Add 1 μM 10% Alexa 488–labeled IRSp53 protein to the SLBs and leave for incubation with SLBs for 1 h at room temperature. Wash the SLBs with the reaction buffer three times (750 μL per wash) to remove any unbound IRSp53 protein. Image using Zeiss LSM 800 microscope (Figure 2Aii). Figure 2.

Actin reconstitution and labeled actin preparation Reconstitute lyophilized muscle actin protein to 10 mg/mL with 100 μL of deionized water and then dilute to 0.4 mg/mL in G-buffer supplemented with 0.2 mM ATP and 0.5 mM DTT. After reconstitution, incubate actin on ice for 1 h to depolymerize actin oligomers that form during storage. Further centrifuge the actin resuspension at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube and determine the total protein concentration with a NanoDrop. Reconstitute lyophilized rhodamine muscle actin protein to 10 mg/mL with 2 μL of deionized water and then dilute to 2 mg/mL with G-buffer supplemented with 0.2 mM ATP and 1 mM DTT. Leave actin solution on ice for 1 h to depolymerize actin oligomers. Centrifuge the rhodamine actin resuspension at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Transfer the top 90% of the supernatant to a new tube and determine the total protein concentration and percentage of rhodamine-labeled protein with a NanoDrop.

    "title": "Using HBmito Crimson to Observe Mitochondrial Cristae Through STED Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial cristae, formed by folding the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM), are essential for cellular energy supply. However, the observation of the IM is challenging due to the limitations in spatiotemporal resolution offered by conventional microscopy and the absence of suitable in vitro probes speciﬁcally targeting the IM. Here, we describe a detailed imaging protocol for the mitochondrial inner membrane using the Si-rhodamine dye HBmito Crimson, which has excellent photophysical properties, to label live cells for imaging via stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. This allows for STED imaging over more than 500 frames (approximately one hour), with a spatial resolution of 40 nm, enabling the observation of cristae dynamics during various mitochondrial processes. The protocol includes detailed steps for cell staining, image acquisition, image processing, and resolution analysis. Utilizing the superior resolution of STED microscopy, the structure and complex dynamic changes of cristae can be visualized. Key features • The protocol is designed to visualize mitochondrial cristae in living cells using STED microscopy. • The protocol enables nanoscale observation of dynamic mitochondrial cristae. • Real-time observation of mitochondrial morphological changes, fusion, and fission events.",

STED saturation power measurement STED saturation power refers to the laser power required to effectively deplete the fluorescence of dye molecules. Dyes with low saturation power improve the overall quality of STED imaging, especially in high-resolution, long-term experiments. Therefore, saturation power is a key parameter for determining whether a dye is suitable for high-resolution imaging. Additionally, measuring saturation power can help estimate the optimal depletion laser intensity needed for imaging, such as in section C for setting the depletion power of HBmito Crimson. The resolution in STED microscopy can be described by the following formula: d ≈ λ 2 N . A . 1 + I S T E D I s a t λ is the excitation wavelength, N.A. is the numerical aperture of the microscope objective, I STED is the intensity of the depletion laser, and I sat is the saturation intensity of the fluorophore. From the formula, it is evident that when I STED remains constant, decreasing the saturation power I sat increases I STED /I sat , resulting in higher resolution. Therefore, low-saturation-power probes can achieve high resolution at lower laser powers, effectively reducing photobleaching and phototoxicity. 1. Add 1 mL of HBmito Crimson DMSO solution to a 35 mm glass bottom dish. 2. Set the spatial light modulator (775 nm) mode to “none” in the background interface of the commercial STED system, transforming the depletion beam of the donut distribution into a Gaussian distribution. Set the excitation intensity to 3%, which can be calibrated according to the dye's brightness. Adjust the excitation intensity to 3%, calibrated based on the brightness of the dye. Gradually increase the depletion laser intensity from 0%, in increments of 1%–3% (approximately 2–5 mW), e.g., 0%, 2%, 4%, and so on, up to 50%. At each depletion laser intensity level, capture two images—one with the excitation laser on and one with it off. Record the average fluorescence intensity for each image. 3. For each depletion laser power, subtract the average fluorescence intensity of the excitation-off image from that of the excitation-on image. Plot the normalized fluorescence intensity against the depletion laser intensity. Fit the data to a curve and identify the point at which the fluorescence intensity decreases to 50% of its initial value. The corresponding depletion laser intensity at this point is the saturation power of the dye. Note: Repeat the imaging and recording at each laser intensity multiple times to ensure data accuracy and reliability. Monitor the sample for photobleaching to prevent damage from excessive excitation and adjust the laser settings as needed to minimize photobleaching. B. Sample preparation In our work, COS7 cells were cultured in a cell culture flask with COS7 medium. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 for 2–3 days. When the cells reach 80% density, remove the original COS7 medium and wash the cells with 3 mL of PBS to eliminate the residual medium. Add 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution for digestion for 3 min. After digestion, add 1 mL of COS7 cell medium to stop the digestion process. Centrifuge the digested cells at 200× g for 3 min to collect the cell pellet. Seed approximately 6 × 10 4 –9 × 10 4 cells into 35 mm glass-bottom dishes. For optimal imaging results, ensure that the cells are evenly distributed and not overcrowded after seeding. Allow the cells to grow in the incubator for 24 h. A confluence between 40%–80% is ideal for subsequent labeling and imaging procedures. If cell washing is required, the optimal imaging time is within 1 h after washing. Remove the original medium and add 1 mL of HBmito Crimson solution, incubating for 10 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 environment. Without washing, proceed directly to STED imaging, making the necessary adjustments to meet specific experimental requirements. Note: When preparing cells for imaging, several key factors must be considered: Cell density: Maintain an appropriate cell density (between 40% and 80%) to ensure cell health while providing sufficient space for single-cell imaging. High cell density may lead to cell aggregation, adversely affecting image quality. Culture medium selection: Choose an appropriate basal medium and serum for different cell lines to ensure optimal growth conditions. Contamination control: Cells must be free of any contamination to ensure reliable imaging results. The inclusion of antibiotics in the culture medium can help prevent contamination. C. Image acquisition This protocol is specifically designed for use with the Abberior Facility Line, but the method can be adapted for use with other STED microscopes as well. When acquiring live-cell imaging with fluorophores, it is crucial to select the appropriate wavelength range. Optimal excitation power, depletion laser power, pixel size, line accumulations, and dwell time should be empirically determined to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing photobleaching, particularly during extended time-lapse imaging. We also recommend positioning the cells in the center of the field of view (FOV), as the imaging quality is best at the center of the FOV. Excitation power : Select an appropriate excitation wavelength based on the dye properties and experimental requirements. For HBmito Crimson, use an excitation wavelength of 640 nm. Start with a low excitation intensity (1%–5%) and gradually increase the excitation intensity in increments of 1%–3%. Determine an appropriate excitation power value based on the signal intensity observed in the image. Be cautious to avoid over-excitation, which can lead to photobleaching of the sample and prevent signal oversaturation. Depletion laser power : Select an appropriate depletion wavelength. For HBmito Crimson, use a STED depletion laser wavelength of 775 nm. Start with a depletion laser power of 15%–20% (approximately 20–30 mW) and gradually increase the intensity in increments of 1%–3% (approximately 2–5 mW). Adjust the depletion light intensity based on the observed resolution and SNR in the images. Pixel size : In STED microscopy, setting an appropriate pixel size is crucial to satisfy the Nyquist sampling theorem and ensure that the acquired images accurately reflect the sample's details and resolution. Pixel size should be at least 1/2 of the resolution, i.e., pixel size ≤ d/2. Dwell time : Dwell time determines the exposure time for each pixel, thereby influencing the SNR and resolution of the image. For most samples, the setting of dwell time is typically between 1 and 10 μs. This range ensures that the image maintains an adequate SNR. If the sample signal is relatively weak, the exposure time can be increased to 10–20 μs to enhance the signal collection per pixel. A longer dwell time will improve the SNR, but it also increases the overall imaging time and the risk of photobleaching. Line accumulations : The setting of line accumulations affects the SNR and resolution of the image. For common samples, the default line accumulations are typically set between 2 and 4 times. This range significantly enhances the SNR while avoiding excessive exposure that could lead to photobleaching. If the SNR is weak, the number of line accumulations can be increased, ensuring the sample remains stable and motionless during the acquisition process and does not shift due to prolonged acquisition times. For unstable samples, it is advisable to reduce the number of line accumulations. For experiments requiring high resolution and high SNR, consider setting line accumulations to higher values (e.g., 8 or more). Conversely, for rapid imaging needs or samples prone to photobleaching, lower line accumulations (e.g., 1–2 times) can be selected to reduce photobleaching and imaging time. To determine the optimal imaging parameters, we recommend using the method of controlled variables, systematically altering one parameter at a time to observe its effect on image quality. This approach allows for achieving the best image quality and highest resolution. Power on the microscope system, ensuring proper communication between the software and hardware, and open the Abberior Facility Line software. Select the 63× oil immersion objective and apply immersion oil to the lens. Place the standard beads sample on the sample holder, open the software, select the alignment function, and wait for the system dialog to display the message \"alignment successful,\" indicating the program is complete. Ensure both excitation and depletion lasers are properly aligned. Connect the live-cell incubation chamber to the microscope system. Once the environmental conditions in the incubation chamber stabilize at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , and 75% humidity, add the prepared sample. Use the microscope’s autofocus function to locate the sample’s focal plane. The Abberior autofocus actively stabilizes the Z-position of the sample, with continuous Z-drift compensation ensuring that focal drift does not occur during confocal and STED imaging. Identify a suitable imaging area in confocal mode. Adjust the imaging parameters accordingly. As shown in Figure 2 , λ Ex 640 nm: 15.7 μW; λ Dep 775 nm: 71.2 mW; pixel size: 20 nm; line accumulations: 3; dwell time: 6.5 μs; ROI: 44.5 μm × 50.74 μm; detection wavelength: 650–750 nm. Figure 2. Comparison of confocal and STED imaging results in living COS7 cell mitochondria labeled with HBmito Crimson. Scale bar in the original image is 5 μm. Scale bar in the enlarged image is 1 μm. Acquire STED images, ensuring that confocal and STED images are collected simultaneously. For long-term imaging, appropriately reduce the excitation power, depletion power, line accumulations, and dwell time based on empirical observations. Depletion laser intensity can be reduced to approximately half of that used for single-frame imaging to meet the imaging requirements. Set the time intervals and number of imaging frames, then acquire images. As shown in Figure 3 , λ Ex 640 nm: 12.75 μW; λ Dep 775 nm: 34.7 mW; pixel size: 25 nm; line accumulations: 3; dwell time: 5 μs; frame time: 8.22 s; ROI: 4.75 μm × 7.025 μm; detection wavelength: 650–750 nm. Figure 3. Long-term imaging of mitochondria in COS7 cells labeled with HBmito Crimson; white arrow indicates fusion event. Scale bar: 1 μm. Note: When determining parameters for long-term imaging, ensure the minimal necessary laser intensity and exposure time to achieve only the required resolution. For mitochondrial cristae imaging, the minimum resolution requirement is defined as the clear visualization of cristae structures at the given power level. By utilizing these optimized settings, long-term imaging can minimize photobleaching effects, allowing for the acquisition of more frames and extending the imaging duration. Save the data. D. Extended image processing Process single-frame images directly using Huygens software, setting post-processing parameters for each channel separately. For long-term imaging, it is recommended to first perform intensity correction, followed by batch deconvolution in Huygens software. Open the Huygens Professional software. Import the image files that need deconvolution by selecting File > Open . Access the image properties by selecting the image in the main window. This option can be found under the Edit menu or by right-clicking the image and selecting Properties . Set the microscope parameters accordingly: Objective lens: Enter the numerical aperture (N.A.) and magnification of the objective lens used to acquire the images. Excitation wavelength ( λ Ex ): Specify the excitation wavelength used during imaging. Emission wavelength ( λ Em ): Enter the emission wavelength corresponding to the fluorescence channel. Voxel size: Input the pixel size (in x, y, and z dimensions) used during image acquisition. Refractive index: Enter the refractive index of the immersion medium used (e.g., oil, water, glycerol). Pinhole radius: If using a confocal microscope, specify the pinhole radius or size. Select point spread function (PSF): In the Restoration menu, select the PSF option. If the software does not automatically detect the PSF, you can manually select or load the appropriate PSF file. Select Deconvolution Wizard from the Restoration menu. Deconvolution is typically performed using the classic maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) algorithm, where the software automatically calculates parameters like SNR and background. These default settings are optimized to handle most images. However, parameters such as iteration count, SNR, and background can be manually adjusted to enhance image quality, especially for more complex or low-SNR images. Click the Run button to start deconvolution processing. After processing, use the software's visualization tool to view the deconvolved image. Save the processed image by selecting Save As from the File menu. Save the image in common formats such as TIFF, JPEG, or other available formats. Use the Batch Processor tool to perform batch deconvolution processing on multiple image files. After setting the batch processing parameters and file path, click the Start Batch button to start processing.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article: Ren et al [11].

    "title": "Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Quantification of the Mouse Hind Paw Footpads: A Detailed and Simplified Protocol.",
    "abstract": "Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is an underdiagnosed condition characterized by sensory and autonomic dysfunction due to impairment of small nerve fibers in skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. Various underlying disorders are associated with SFN, and the pathophysiology of nerve fiber damage and functional impairment is the subject of extensive research. Diagnosis of SFN is challenging as standard electrodiagnostic techniques assess large fiber function and therefore are normal in SFN patients. The current gold standard for SFN diagnosis in humans is a skin biopsy, commonly obtained from the distal leg, hairy skin region, with evaluation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) using protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) immunolabeling. While well-established in clinical practice, equivalent standardized, reproducible methods for assessing IENFD in experimental mouse models are lacking, which limits translational research in this field. Previous work in mice has relied on diverse antibodies, variable tissue sampling, and the use of confocal microscopy to trace nerve fibers. Other approaches have used chromogenic precipitate-based staining, which limits the ability to co-label multiple proteins. Here, we present a detailed, simple, and reproducible protocol for IENFD quantification of small nerves in the distal glabrous skin of the mouse hind paw. This protocol uses the two distal footpads, ensuring consistent sampling across animals. Prior to sectioning, the tissue is fixed and cryoprotected. Serial 20-μm sections are mounted on glass slides, dried, permeabilized, blocked, and immunostained with an anti-PGP9.5 monoclonal antibody, and then detected by binding secondary fluorescent-labeled antibodies. Although murine hairy skin analysis may apparently show a higher translational value, as it better reflects human biopsy sites, it is compromised by dense hair shafts and follicles, which interrupt epidermis continuity and thus interfere with sampling consistency. Polyneuropathy sensory symptoms, in fact, begin at the most distal sensory site, which is the glabrous skin of the toes. Thus, evaluation of this anatomical location best represents the clinical realm and may have the best sensitivity for identifying early axonal changes. In this protocol, we focused on IENFD quantification as done in human samples. Mechanoreceptors such as Meissner corpuscles are detectable and quantifiable by this method, and represent additional value since pressure-evoked pain, transmitted by these, is often reported by affected individuals. This immunolabeling protocol can be completed within one day [involving a small number of animals, where all three stages can be performed during a long working day (approximately 12 h)], while the entire workflow, including fixation and cryoprotection, is completed in up to 72 h. Importantly, the dermal and epidermal small fibers can be visualized using a standard fluorescence microscope, thereby avoiding the need for confocal imaging while maintaining high reproducibility. Preliminary validation in several animal models of inflammatory neuropathy and pain demonstrated a reproducible approximately 50% reduction in IENFD compared to controls, reaching statistical significance with n = 4 per group. This method supports SFN research and preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutics. Key features • Immunostaining protocol for visualizing small epidermal nerve fibers in mouse hind paw footpads. • Use of PGP9.5 labeling, with a monoclonal antibody that is used for human diagnostics, enabling translational comparability between mouse models and clinical studies. • Fluorescence microscopy analysis, without dependence on confocal imaging. • A rapid (12-72 h) and reproducible workflow for skin processing and intraepidermal nerve fiber quantification.",

Euthanasia and tissue dissection 1. Euthanize mice by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (200 mg/mL stock solution, 10 mL/kg, 2,000 mg/kg; CTS Chemical Industries Ltd.) or other institutionally accepted procedures. 2. Amputate the hind paws with nurses’ scissors ( Figure 1 ) and place them on a plastic dish cooled on ice. Figure 1. Dissection tools for isolation of the mouse footpads. From left to right: Nurses’ scissors, Jeweler’s forceps, tissue forceps, Vannas scissors, and Petri dish on a stable surface. 3. Dissect the two distal glabrous footpads (#2 and #3 from medial to lateral) from each hind paw ( Figure 2 ) under a binocular microscope. Remove the pads by making a deep 45° incision ( Figure 2 ) and extract a conical-shaped tissue from the deep portion of the paw skin using Vannas scissors, tissue forceps, and Jeweler’s forceps ( Figure 1 ). Note: Optimal sampling is achieved by cutting the glabrous skin layer together with only the very thin underlying connective tissue, avoiding deeper dissection toward the tendinous or bony layers of the footpad. The correct depth can be recognized by preserving the intact dermal-epidermal structure without visible muscle or bone exposure. Figure 2. Hind paw footpads’ dissection. (A) The palmar surface of the paw is positioned facing upward. Dashed circle indicates the locations of the medial (#2) and lateral (#3) distal footpads selected for sampling. A conical skin sample, including the pads, is excised using Vannas scissors at an approximate 45° angle. (B) Schematic representation illustrating the angle and orientation of the skin tissue excision. B. Tissue fixation and cryoprotection 1. Transfer the dissected skin pads to an Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of 4% PFA solution and fixate the tissue for 30 min on ice. 2. Transfer the tissue to an Eppendorf filled with 1 mL of PBS and let it stand for an additional 30 min on ice. 3. Transfer the tissue to an Eppendorf filled with 1 mL of 30% sucrose solution and incubate at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The protocol was validated for this duration; however, incubation can be extended up to 48 h (due to technical constraints) without affecting tissue morphology or staining quality. 4. Fill a silicon mold with optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) at RT and embed the skin in the OCT with the palmar surface facing up. 5. Place molds at -20 °C on a horizontal surface, undisturbed, for a minimum of 30 min to freeze ( Figure 3A ). 6. Once fully solidified, remove the OCT from the mold and transfer it to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube to prevent dehydration ( Figure 3B ). Estimated time: The time required for dissection and tissue transfer steps between solutions varies according to the number of animals processed; for a single animal, this step takes about 2 h and 15 min. Optional pause point: These Eppendorf tubes can be stored at -20 °C until sectioning. Notes: 1. The glabrous skin of the footpad was dissected with Vannas scissors, including the epidermis and a thin layer of dermis, avoiding deeper connective, tendinous, or bony tissue. Correct depth was confirmed by the absence of muscle or bone exposure. To ensure consistency across mice, the cut was made parallel to the surface of the pad at the junction between the central pad and surrounding skin. 2. Samples can safely remain in sucrose for up to 48 h without noticeable adverse effects. Since the tissue dimensions are very small, the tissue sinking to the bottom of the Eppendorf tube is not observed in all cases; rather, the minimal 1 h duration in the sucrose solution was found to be sufficient to gradually equilibrate and protect the tissue from ice crystal formation during freezing. Once cryoprotection is complete, tissues are embedded in OCT compound for freezing and sectioning. C. Cryosectioning 1. Set the cryostat to -18 °C ( Figure 3C ). Figure 3. Tissue embedded in OCT compound positioned in the cryostat for sectioning. (A) Multiple frozen footpad samples embedded in OCT-filled silicon molds. (B) A frozen OCT block containing an embedded footpad sample immersed in the OCT before sectioning. (C) Overview of the cryostat showing the OCT-embedded tissue block. (D) Enlarged view of the cold stage with the OCT-embedded tissue block positioned for sectioning. The blocks are trimmed and, therefore, the footpads are visible. (E) Enlarged view of the disc chuck secured in the specimen head, demonstrating tissue mounting for sectioning. (F) Enlarged view of the tissue demonstrating two domes (indicated by solid arrows) separated by a central concavity (indicated by a dashed arrow). (G) Schematic side view of the biopsy showing the optimal and non-optimal cutting areas. The red dashed arrows represent regions that should not be collected, while the solid green arrow indicates the optimal region from which sections should be collected for staining. (H) Schematic front view of the biopsy showing the height of the domes in the optimal sectioning area (indicated by the green arrow). OCT: Optimal cutting temperature. 2. Dispense a thin, even layer of fresh OCT directly onto a pre-cooled cryostat specimen holder (disc chuck) while it is on the cryostat cooling stage. Carefully place the embedded tissue block onto the OCT so that it lies flat, with the skin pads facing upward ( Figure 3D ). 3. Once the OCT layer has solidified, rotate the disc chuck to position the skin pads parallel to the sectioning plane ( Figure 3E ). 4. Trim the OCT-embedded tissue to identify the two footpads, which appear as distinct convex domes separated by a central concavity. 5. Cut serial 20 µm-thick tissue sections. In our hands, approximately nine consecutive sections are required to reach the optimal level corresponding to the central region of the pads, where two distinct convex domes are separated by a central concavity ( Figure 3F ). The first nine sections should not be collected, as they do not represent the optimal region for analysis. Once this level is reached, the tissue samples are positioned at their optimal height, allowing for the collection that best captures the anatomical features of the domes and the central concavity ( Figure 3G ). The average dome height of approximately 450 µm was determined by measuring the distance from the top of the ridge to the level of the surrounding footpad skin surface ( Figure 3H ). The biopsy itself is collected slightly deeper than this level, which explains why the total tissue block dimensions often exceed 450 µm. From this optimal region, we typically collect an additional nine consecutive sections, yielding a total of three slides containing three sections per slide. A schematic illustration and a higher-magnification image are provided to depict the distinct convex domes and central concavity, clarifying the anatomical reference used for sectioning. 6. Mount three non-adjacent tissue sections on each slide, representing three repeated tissue samplings. 7. Mark the slide with a pencil. Estimated time: The time required for cutting the tissue varies according to the number of animals processed; for a single animal, this step takes up to 15 min. Optional pause point: Store the slides at -20 °C until further use. D. Immunostaining 1. Place the slides in a 55 mm glass Petri dish containing 25 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Incubate for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation (~30 rpm). 2. Rinse the slides three times with 25 mL of PBS for 5 min each in a Coplin jar. 3. Outline tissue sections using a hydrophobic barrier Immunopen. 4. Incubate in blocking solution (0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal horse serum in PBS), at 50 µL per slide for 1 h at RT without shaking in the stain tray. 5. Incubate with the primary antibody diluted 1:200 in blocking solution, 50 µL per slide, for 1 h at RT in the stain tray. 6. Rinse the slides three times with 25 mL of PBS for 5 min in a Coplin jar. 7. Incubate with the secondary antibody diluted 1:400 in blocking buffer, 50 µL per slide, for 45–60 min at RT. 8. Rinse the slides three times with 25 mL of PBS, 5 min each in a Coplin jar at RT. Keep the Coplin jar covered, as the secondary antibody is light sensitive. 9. Cover sections with a glass coverslip using Fluoromount, 50 µL per slide. Optional pause point: Store mounted slides at 4 °C [in a light-proof (dark, closed) box] for long-term preservation until further use. Estimated time: The time required for staining the tissues is 6.5 h. Note: We recommend performing slide counting and quantification within one week after staining, as we observed that cellular morphology may change over time. After one week, some fibers that initially appeared intact showed altered morphology or lost their visible penetration from the dermis into the epidermis. Nevertheless, slides can still be used for imaging and general qualitative assessment even after several weeks, as we did not identify a specific time point beyond which the slides must be discarded. E. Image acquisition 1. Use microscope software that enables image acquisition and length measurements. 2. Use the 4× objective lens and the DAPI (405 nm) fluorescence channel to identify two footpads in each section. DAPI staining highlights the nuclei, allowing clear visualization of the epidermal layer and the boundaries of the pads. 3. Measure the linear length of each pad along the surface of the epidermis using the polylinear line tool of the CellSens Microscope Imaging Software. These measurements will be used to calculate fiber density ( Figure 4B ). Figure 4. Representative images of skin sections for intraepidermal nerve fiber analysis. (A) Length measurement of epidermal surface across two digital pads using microscope software (4×, DAPI 405 nm channel). (B) Higher magnification (20×, DAPI 405 nm channel) DAPI-labeled basal keratinocyte cell layer. The papillary appearance of the dermis is highlighted by DAPI labeling. (C) 488 nm channel for detection of PGP9.5. Anti-PGP9.5 exhibits some nonspecific binding to dermal connective tissue, which can aid in identifying the dermal–epidermal junction and visualizing nerve fibers crossing it. At 20× magnification (20×), Meissner’s corpuscles can also be identified in the epidermis (white arrow). DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). PGP9.5: Protein gene product 9.5. Scale bars: 200 µm (A) and 100 µm (B and C). Note: Since counting the ridges represents the most critical step for the success of the protocol, samples or slides with folded or poorly stained ridges were excluded from the analysis. 4. Use the 20× objective lens to identify the dermal-epidermal junction lined by the basal cell layer ( Figure 4B ). 5. Use the 488 nm fluorescence channel to detect PGP9.5 labeled axons ( Figure 4C ). Note that not all axons are visible at the same focus plane; thus, focus adjustments are required to inspect all fibers within the thickness of the tissue. 6. Longitudinally scan each pad and manually count the fibers that clearly cross the dermal-epidermal junction and traverse the basal cell layer of the epidermis. Only fibers that unambiguously penetrate the dermal–epidermal junction should be counted (see counting criteria, Figure 5 ). Do not count fibers that do not clearly penetrate the dermal–epidermal junction (Figure 5Aa). Any segment that penetrates the basal cell layer is counted (Figure 5Aa). Nerve fibers that do not cross into the epidermis (Figure 5Ab) and nerve fibers that are present within the epidermis without a clear crossing point (Figure 5Af) are not counted. Notes: 1. Do not include fragments, tangential profiles, or fibers associated with adnexal structures such as sweat glands. 2. Adjust the focal plane during counting to visualize fibers at different tissue depths, ensuring that all intraepidermal fibers are detected. 3. The entire tissue fits within three frames of view. Although images are not captured, fibers are counted manually at 20× magnification, using the stage control wheel to map and count along the entire tissue. Estimated time: The time required for scanning and counting the fibers varies according to the number of animals; for a single animal, this step takes 10 min. Note: Images were acquired using the CellSens software (Olympus). Comparable results can be obtained using alternative platforms such as ImageJ/Fiji, Zen (Zeiss), or NIS-Elements (Nikon). To ensure reproducibility, all images should be acquired at a resolution of at least 0.3 µm/pixel using a calibrated fluorescence microscope (20–40× objective). Calibration with a micrometer scale prior to acquisition is recommended to confirm spatial accuracy. Figure 5. Illustration of intraepidermal nerve fiber counting criteria. (A) Schematic representation of intraepidermal nerve fibers that are considered for quantification: a) A nerve fiber that crosses the dermal–epidermal junction is counted; b) a nerve fiber in the dermis that does not cross the dermal–epidermal junction is not counted; c) a nerve fiber in the dermis that crosses the keratinocyte cell layer is counted, but a branch that remains in the dermis is not; d) a nerve fiber that branches below the dermal-epidermal junction is counted as two nerve fibers; e) a nerve fiber that branches above the junction is counted as a single nerve; and f) a nerve fiber that is present in the epidermis without a clear crossing through the dermal-epidermal junction is not counted. (B) Immunofluorescence images of glabrous skin showing PGP9.5-immunolabeled epidermal small fibers. White boxes represent recognized fibers corresponding to the above-mentioned criteria. Note that a Meissner corpuscle is seen in glabrous skin (in box a, between two small fibers) and may be quantified for additional analysis. (C) Combined staining of DAPI and PGP9.5. The papillary appearance of the dermis is highlighted by DAPI labeling, while PGP9.5 stains dermal nerve fibers. This allows for a clear distinction between the two layers and the trajectory of the nerve fibers. Blue arrows indicate nerve fibers that originate in the dermis: the lower blue arrow points to a fiber within the dermis, while the upper blue arrow marks its continuation into the epidermis. In contrast, the white arrows point to fibers located in the epidermis without a clear crossing through the dermal–epidermal junction. DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). PGP9.5: Protein gene product 9.5. Scale bars: 100 µm (B) and 20 µm (C).\n\nValidation of protocol • Tissue sampling, processing, and immunofluorescence staining: Previous work [12] established a rigorous workflow for preparing glabrous footpad skin, detailing dissection, fixation, embedding, sectioning, and permeabilization steps that are critical for preserving tissue integrity. Importantly, the study validated that precise sectioning combined with standardized immunolabeling reliably reveals small-diameter intraepidermal nerve fibers with high reproducibility. These findings provided a methodological foundation for our protocol, ensuring that the early preparation and staining steps are technically robust and capable of generating accurate and reproducible visualization of epidermal innervation. • Anti-PGP9.5 antibody for small fiber identification: The monoclonal anti-PGP9.5 antibody, widely regarded as the gold standard in human clinical evaluation, enables clear labeling of C and Aδ fibers and supports accurate visualization and quantification comparable to validated protocols using thick or thin skin biopsies [11,16]. In our protocol, 20 μm cryosections of mouse glabrous (footpad) skin are processed using Triton-based permeabilization with controlled shaking, followed by blocking and same-day incubation with both primary and secondary antibodies. This streamlined approach ensures high specificity, reproducibility, and direct applicability to the murine setting while maintaining alignment with established standards. Our staining also enabled the clear visualization of Meissner corpuscles—mechanoreceptors located in the dermal papillae that are directly associated with C fibers. Both structures play an essential role in sensing tactile and nociceptive stimuli in the paw. The staining method thus serves as a marker not only for thin fiber quantification but also for the reliable identification of Meissner corpuscles, another advantage of the approach. In addition to intraepidermal nerve fibers and Meissner corpuscles, we also observed that PGP9.5 immunostaining highlighted sweat glands. • Reproducibility and statistical validation of thin fiber quantification: In order to validate our results, fiber quantification was independently assessed by an additional evaluator who was blinded to the identity of the slides. The majority of our experiments were performed on 12-week-old ICR mice, with a dataset comprising more than 30 animals. Quantification was based on the average of two glabrous pads per sample, providing a consistent measure of intra-sample variability. We compared the two footpads within the same paw and found no significant differences in measured parameter(s) (p > 0.05). Therefore, sampling both footpads increases the likelihood of obtaining a technically successful measurement while also providing biological replication that supports the robustness of the findings. In control animals, the average fiber count per two glabrous pads was approximately 15 ± 5 fibers. For quantification, both evaluators performed counts on three replicates from a single slide of each sample. Each replicate included two glabrous pads, and the average of the counts was used due to their high consistency. Quantification reproducibility was assessed by two independent examiners, showing high inter-rater reliability (r > 0.9) and a mean standard deviation below 10% across samples, indicating robust consistency of the IENFD analysis. The minimal deviation observed between the two independent counts further confirms that the staining is clear, reproducible, and robust, with fibers appearing distinct and reliably quantifiable.",

    "title": "Monitoring Endocytosis of Integral Membrane Proteins Using Western Blot-Based Detection of Biotinylated Antibody Uptake.",
    "abstract": "The antibody-uptake assay is a commonly used technique to monitor endocytosis of integral membrane proteins including transmembrane and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). The antibody-uptake assay typically involves incubating live cells with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of the integral membrane protein of interest. Antibody uptake is then detected by flow cytometry or confocal microscopy. However, these detection modalities may be inaccessible to some labs or require extensive training to operate. Thus, we developed an easy and novel sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot-based approach to the antibody-uptake assay that exploits the strong affinity between biotin and streptavidin. Instead of incubating cells with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies to monitor antibody uptake, our assay involves incubating cells with biotinylated antibodies, processing the cell lysates for western blot, and probing the membrane with detectably conjugated streptavidin. From preparation to quantification, this protocol requires less hands-on time than other approaches and is amenable to small-scale drug or siRNA screens. Here, we demonstrate the utility of our approach using the well-characterized misfolded GPI-AP, YFP-tagged C179A mutant of prion protein (YFP-PrP*), as our model substrate. YFP-PrP* constitutively traffics to the plasma membrane (PM), where it binds to anti-GFP antibody, and immediately undergoes endocytosis to lysosomes. To validate our protocol, we present measurements of antibody uptake under conditions known to enhance or inhibit YFP-PrP*'s traffic to the PM. Using this assay, we present new evidence that, under certain conditions, YFP-PrP* is able to undergo degradation via a pathway that does not involve exposure on the cell surface. Key features • Incubate live cells with biotinylated primary antibody and a lysosomal degradation inhibitor, process lysates for western blot, and probe the blot with detectably conjugated streptavidin. • Fast, easy, and semi-quantitative assay to test whether integral membrane proteins are degraded through pathways involving exposure on the plasma membrane. • Conduct screens for small molecules, siRNAs, or conditions that promote or inhibit traffic of your protein of interest through the plasma membrane. • Pair this protocol with a synchronized trafficking assay to detect changes in the rate of proteins traversing the plasma membrane.",
    "methods": "Materials and reagents Biological materials 1. Healthy cells. This protocol applies to any adherent, proliferating, or differentiated cultured cells. Note: Since we are monitoring traffic of YFP-PrP* to the cell surface via the RESET pathway for the proof-of-principle experiments presented below in the Validation of protocol section, we opted to use normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. NRK cells were used by Satpute-Krishnan et al. in the Lippincott–Schwartz lab to identify the RESET pathway [20]. In follow-up work, we used them to further dissect the RESET pathway [18,19,22]. These NRK cells were derived from a clonal line previously characterized by the Lippincott-Schwartz lab as adherent cells and used in membrane trafficking studies [24]. Recommendations: 1. Determine the number of replicates per condition within and across experiments. For experimental results that one plans to quantify, we recommend a minimum of three biological replicates. Each biological replicate should be executed on a different day using freshly prepared medium and drug treatments. For example, in our proof-of-principle experiments, we conducted three biological replicates to obtain measurements and perform statistical analysis (described below). If the experimentalist has little to no experience executing cell culture experiments or carrying out western blots, we recommend a minimum of three technical replicates within a single experiment. This will allow for troubleshooting in the case of varied results. 2. Include a positive control to verify that your biotinylated antibody binds to the antigen (i.e., your integral membrane protein of interest) in the context of the antibody-uptake conditions. If there is no preexisting evidence that your integral membrane protein of interest traffics to the PM, consider overexpressing a fusion protein to test the antigen–antibody interaction. This fusion protein would include the extracellular domain of your integral membrane protein of interest (i.e., the antigen) on a known PM-resident protein and function as a positive control. To validate our protocol, we used the following cells for our positive controls: a. YFP-PrP* NRK cells: These NRK cells stably express the well-characterized RESET substrate, YFP-PrP*, at physiological levels, similar to the prion protein in mouse brain lysate [19,20]. YFP-PrP* includes an N-terminal prolactin signal sequence to ensure ER-translocation, a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tag, followed by the Syrian hamster prion protein (PrP) mature domain containing a C179A point mutation [20]. YFP-PrP* and GFP-PrP* were each previously shown to bind and internalize anti-GFP antibodies upon accessing the PM [18–21]. b. YFP-PrP* NRK cells treated with thapsigargin (TG): TG-treatment of YFP-PrP* NRK cells was shown to increase the flux of YFP-PrP* traffic to the PM and antibody uptake when compared to untreated YFP-PrP* NRK cells [20]. 3. Include negative controls to determine baseline antibody uptake. This can be cells treated with RNAi or CRISPR knockout technology to remove the integral membrane protein of interest, or cells treated with chemical or siRNA-based inhibitors of the secretory pathway to prevent the integral membrane protein of interest from accessing the PM. To validate our protocol, we used the following cells for our negative controls: a. NRK cells: These untransfected cells serve as a negative control for anti-GFP antibody uptake because they do not express an FP-tagged protein. They are the “parental” cell line from which the YFP-PrP* NRK stable cell line was derived. b. YFP-CD3δ NRK cells: These NRK cells stably express YFP-CD3δ, a well-characterized ER-associated degradation (ERAD) substrate [25,26], at similar levels to the expression of YFP-PrP* in YFP-PrP* NRK cells [19,20]. They serve as a negative control because YFP-CD3δ would not be expected to undergo ER export but is instead degraded at the ER [25,26]. c. YFP-PrP* NRK cells treated with BRD4780: BRD4780-treatment of YFP-PrP* NRK cells was shown to inhibit RESET of YFP-PrP* [18]. Thus, BRD4780 would be expected to block traffic to the PM and thereby prevent anti-GFP antibody uptake. d. YFP-PrP* NRK cells treated without biotinylated anti-GFP antibody in media: These cells would not be expected to show a streptavidin-binding band by western blot, because no biotinylated antibodies would have been added in the medium for the cells to uptake.

Cell culture and preparation 1. Thaw cells into a 10 cm tissue culture-treated dish in standard cell culture medium. Note: To validate our protocol, we used NRK, YFP-PrP* NRK, and YFP-CD3δ NRK cells cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. We did not include penicillin/streptomycin. We cultured the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 and maintained them in the growth phase. 2. Split the cells into a multi-well tissue culture-treated dish. Depending on the cell type, split them at the optimal confluency for growth or differentiation. For our validation experiments, we used a 6-well tissue culture-treated dish. We split cells so they were at 35% confluency and allowed the cells to double over 24 h to approximately 70% confluency. Notes: 1. The optimal tissue-culture treatment may depend on the cell type. For example, we have observed that NRK cells are naturally adherent and adhere to untreated glass or commercially available tissue culture-treated plastic in under 1 h after trypsinization. However, other cell types may require the dish to be prepared with additional coatings, such as extracellular matrix proteins or poly-L-lysine. 2. Prior to performing the antibody-uptake experiment, we recommend optimizing cell culture seeding, incubation, and splitting procedures, because these depend on the cell type. For example, we have observed NRK cells double within 24 h and do not require being cultured at high densities (e.g., they can easily form colonies when single cells are seeded alone in a well). However, other cell types need to be seeded at greater than 50% confluency to survive. The growth behavior of NRK cells under our standard culturing conditions is predictable, allowing us to split and seed them based on confluency. However, for cell types that have limited proliferative capacity such as primary cells or iPSC-derived differentiated cells, an absolute cell count may be required to seed the cells for optimal cell culture viability and antibody-uptake results. B. Treatment with biotinylated antibody diluted in culture media and cell lysis 1. Check cells under a phase microscope on the day of the experiment to ensure healthy growth and confluency. We performed our experiments on cells that were 70% confluent in order to avoid overcrowding and contact inhibition. 2. Prepare all media in advance of treating cells. We allowed media to warm up to room temperature for 15 min before preparing treatments. We prepared the following treatments: a. +Baf condition: Complete medium with 500 nM bafilomycin A1. b. +Baf +Ab condition: Complete medium with 500 nM bafilomycin A1 and 1 μg/mL biotinylated antibody. c. +Baf +TG +Ab condition: Complete medium with 500 nM bafilomycin A1, 0.1 μM TG, and 1 μg/mL biotinylated antibody. d. BRD4780 pretreatment media: Complete medium with 100 μM BRD4780. e. +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab condition: Complete medium with 100 μM BRD4780 added to cells for a 3 h pretreatment, followed by the addition of 500 nM bafilomycin A1 and 1 μg/mL biotinylated antibody. f. +BRD4780 +Baf +BRD4780 +TG +Ab condition: Complete medium with 100 μM BRD4780 added to cells for a 3 h pretreatment, followed by the addition of 500 nM bafilomycin A1, 0.1 μM TG, and 1 μg/mL biotinylated antibody. Note: Depending on the cell type, it may be necessary to warm the medium to 37 °C before adding medium and antibodies to cells. 3. Aspirate existing culture media and add prepared media containing bafilomycin, +/- biotinylated antibody, and +/- drug modulators. Notes: 1. We included bafilomycin A1 in each treatment. Bafilomycin A1 is a potent inhibitor of vacuolar ATPases that prevents acidification of lysosomes and consequently prevents lysosomal degradation [27]. Blocking lysosomal degradation of the internalized biotinylated antibody is necessary for subsequent western blot analysis. 2. Specifically for +BRD4780 treatments, we pretreated cells with 100 μM BRD4780 for 3 h to induce degradation of TMED9, which we previously showed causes complete inhibition of RESET [18]. After pretreating the cells with BRD4780 for 3 h, we added bafilomycin A1 and biotinylated anti-GFP antibody or bafilomycin A1, TG, and biotinylated anti-GFP antibody to the culture medium for an additional 2 h. 4. Incubate cells for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 (normal cell culture conditions). 5. Remove cells from the incubator and aspirate all culture media. 6. Wash cells three times with PBS prechilled to 4 °C. Critical: During each of the three washes, rock the dish back-and-forth three times to wash away biotinylated antibody that was not internalized by the cells. 7. Add lysis buffer to cells, scrape with precut pipette tips, and collect lysates in prelabeled boil-proof microfuge tubes. Note: We used 200 μL of 2× SB+TCEP pipetted directly into each well of the 6-well plates to lyse cells. We precut p200 pipette tips using standard desk scissors at approximately the 10 μL point at a 45° angle to increase the bore size and the surface area for scraping the cells. However, the key is to scrape the surface of the well and gather the lysate together to move it into boil-proof microfuge tubes. 8. Boil the lysates for 1 min and vortex for 5 s three times in order to break up all of the DNA and solubilize the lysate. 9. Store lysates at -20 °C. C. Western blot Note: Western blot procedure may be conducted based on the individual lab’s specific western blot workflows. 1. Allow frozen samples stored at -20 °C to thaw at room temperature (approximately 5 min). 2. Vortex all samples briefly (approximately 5 s) to ensure a homogenous mixture. Note: If samples were collected in lysis buffer (i.e., RIPA buffer) instead of directly in sample buffer (i.e., Laemmli buffer with reducing agent), add appropriate volumes of western blot sample buffer to each sample. 3. Load samples into the prepared polyacrylamide gel in a gel running apparatus. Note: We use Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN Protein electrophoresis equipment and tris-glycine SDS as running buffer. Critical: Ensure equal or near-equal loading of total protein across all lanes. We do this by seeding the same number of cells in each well at the start of the experiment. Alternatively, immediately after cell lysis, one can employ total protein normalization techniques (e.g., BCA assay). 4. Run gel for approximately 60–75 min at 100 V. Note: If using Bio-Rad’s Stain-Free TM system, activate and collect an image of Stain-Free TM gel to detect total protein. 5. Transfer the gel to an activated PVDF membrane for blotting. Note: After transfer, image the Stain-Free TM blot. The Stain-Free TM system provides an image of total protein, which we use as a loading control. If the Stain-Free TM system is not available, stain the blot with Ponceau S to image total protein loaded into each lane. Ponceau S washes away during the following steps. We recommend using a low fluorescence membrane to improve the western blot signal, especially when using fluorescent secondary antibodies. 6. Block membrane. Note: We used Bio-Rad’s EveryBlot blocking buffer for 10 min at room temperature on a gentle shaker. An alternative is 2% bovine serum albumin (biotin-free) in TBST. Critical: Do not use milk as a blocking buffer. Milk naturally contains biotin, which may interfere with the streptavidin binding and blotting procedure. 7. Probe the blot with streptavidin that was pre-conjugated to a detectable label. Dilute the streptavidin in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Note: We used DyLight800-conjugated streptavidin and diluted it at 1:5,000 in Bio-Rad’s EveryBlot blocking buffer. An alternative is HRP-conjugated streptavidin. An advantage of probing DyLight800-conjugated streptavidin is that the same blot may be reprobed with an antibody against your protein of interest and detected using an HRP-conjugated secondary with no cross-talk between western blot images. Alternatively, run the lysates on two identical gels, and probe one with HRP-streptavidin and the other with the primary antibody against your protein of interest for a standard western blot procedure using an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. 8. Wash the blot three times for 10 min each time with TBST. 9. Image the streptavidin blot with a gel documentation imaging system, selecting exposure times that allow the light collected to remain within the camera’s dynamic range. Note: We use Bio-Rad’s ChemiDoc MP gel documentation imaging system to collect images of the DyLight 800 or chemiluminescence. This system displays an indicator when pixels are oversaturated due to excessively long exposure times. Note: Avoid saturating the pixels during image collection. Stay within the camera’s dynamic range of the gel documentation system because saturated pixels are not quantifiable. Optional: Reprobe using a standard western blot procedure for your integral membrane protein of interest.\n\nValidation of protocol In order to interrogate and validate our new protocol, we have taken advantage of two key features of PrP* trafficking. First, tagged variants of PrP* were previously documented to be rapidly endocytosed upon arriving at the PM [20,21]. Second, rates of PrP* trafficking from the ER to the PM were shown to be increased or decreased by small molecule drugs [18–20]. Thus, by controlling PrP* trafficking from the ER to the PM, we are able to control antibody uptake in predictable ways. During steady-state conditions, YFP-PrP* is slowly released from the ER-resident chaperone, calnexin, for secretion to the PM via an ER-stress inducible ER-to-Golgi export pathway called RESET, which is short for rapid ER-stress induced export [19,20]. At the PM, YFP-PrP* gets rapidly endocytosed and traffics to lysosomes [20]. Flux through the RESET pathway and subsequent access to the PM are rapidly enhanced with the chemical ER stressor, thapsigargin (TG), which triggers dissociation of YFP-PrP* from calnexin [18–20]. Expression of the p24-family members TMED9, TMED2, and TMP21 is required for the ER-to-Golgi export of YFP- or GFP-PrP* via RESET [18,20,21]. BRD4780, which degrades the essential RESET factors TMED9, TMED2, and TMP21 [18,28–31], inhibits RESET of YFP-PrP* [18]. To demonstrate that our western blot–based approach to monitor antibody uptake provides a measurable readout for protein trafficking through the PM, we exploit the following established discoveries: 1. Untransfected “parental” NRK cells do not efficiently internalize anti-GFP antibody, while YFP-PrP* NRK cells do internalize anti-GFP antibody ( Figure 3A , B) [20]. This implicates the direct interaction between the anti-GFP antibody and the cell surface–exposed YFP-tag of YFP-PrP*. Thus, we expect to see no anti-GFP antibody uptake in parental NRK cells ( Figure 3A ), but some antibody uptake in YFP-PrP* NRK cells ( Figure 3B ). Figure 3. Model depicting the expected antibody-uptake results based on previously published experiments. (A–G) Starting from the left side of the image, each shape is labeled the first time that it appears in the figure. The “KEY” provides a magnified view of the features of the biotinylated primary antibody, YFP-PrP*, and YFP-CD3δ. The p24-family members, TMED9, TMED2, and TMP21, are depicted to hetero-oligomerize with each other and possibly other p24-family members, and constitutively cycle between the ER and Golgi [35–37], unless they are selectively degraded upon BRD4780-treatment [28–30]. Calnexin (CNX) is an ER-resident chaperone [38–41]. (B–E) The italicized “ ERAD? ERLAD ?” indicates that a role for these degradation pathways was not previously detected or investigated. (A) Parental (untransfected) NRK cells would not be expected to internalize detectable levels of anti-GFP antibodies because they do not express an FP (e.g., YFP) tagged integral membrane protein (e.g., YFP-PrP*). (B) During steady-state conditions in YFP-PrP* NRK cells, CNX strongly associates with the misfolded GPI-anchored protein YFP-PrP*. Occasionally, CNX releases YFP-PrP* and YFP-PrP* engages with the p24-family members to undergo ER-to-Golgi export via the RESET pathway. From the Golgi, YFP-PrP* gains access to the cell surface, where it can bind and internalize anti-GFP antibodies. (C) Thapsigargin (TG)-treatment induces rapid release of the entire population of YFP-PrP* from CNX for the RESET pathway, allowing for increased anti-GFP antibody uptake. (D) Three-hour BRD4780-pretreatment shuts down the RESET pathway by inducing the degradation of the requisite RESET factors, TMED9, TMED2, and TMP21. Thus, BRD4780-pretreatment would be expected to block constitutive turnover of YFP-PrP* via RESET and thereby prevent anti-GFP antibody uptake. (E) Three-hour BRD4780-pretreatment of YFP-PrP* NRK cells shuts down RESET. Thus, coincubation of BRD4780-pretreated YFP-PrP* NRK cells with TG, which forces YFP-PrP* release from CNX, would be expected to increase the rate of YFP-PrP* degradation via an alternate internal pathway. (F) During steady-state conditions, CNX occasionally releases the integral membrane protein, YFP-CD3δ. However, YFP-CD3δ is a well-characterized ERAD substrate that was shown not to undergo ER-export or RESET. Thus, we expect that YFP-CD3δ would not access the cell surface and internalize the anti-GFP antibody. (G) TG-treatment is known to increase the rate of ERAD of YFP-CD3δ. YFP-CD3δ does not undergo RESET and therefore would not be expected to internalize anti-GFP antibody. 2. Increasing the flux of YFP-PrP* through the RESET pathway with TG-treatment consequently increases the rate of anti-GFP antibody uptake ( Figure 3C ) [20]. Thus, we expect to see an increase in anti-GFP antibody uptake by YFP-PrP* NRK cells that are treated with TG ( Figure 3C ) when compared to untreated YFP-PrP* cells ( Figure 3B ). 3. BRD4780 inhibits the traffic of YFP-PrP* through the RESET pathway [18]. Thus, we expect that BRD4780 treatment of YFP-PrP* NRK cells would block anti-GFP antibody uptake during steady-state or TG-induced ER stress conditions ( Figure 3D , E). 4. YFP-tagged version of the classic ERAD substrate CD3δ, called YFP-CD3δ [32], remains in the ER for constitutive or TG-induced ERAD [25,32–34]. Therefore, we expect that YFP-CD3δ would not internalize anti-GFP antibodies in untreated or TG-treated YFP-CD3δ NRK cells ( Figure 3F , G). To validate our protocol, we first tested whether internalized anti-GFP antibody can be detected in cells. We compared cell lysates of YFP-PrP* NRK cells treated with bafilomycin A1 with or without anti-GFP antibody diluted in media (+Baf +Ab vs. +Baf –Ab; Figure 4 , lanes 1 and 2) against anti-GFP antibody directly dissolved into the sample buffer ( Figure 4 , lane 3). We probed the blot with an antibody against GFP to detect YFP-PrP* and with Streptavidin-DyLight800 to detect the biotinylated antibody heavy and light chains. Critically, we were able to detect the antibody bands specifically in the lanes where the antibody was included. Taken together, the biotinylated primary antibody that has been internalized into cells is readily detectable by SDS-PAGE and western blot when using streptavidin to probe the blot ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4. Western blot demonstrating the detection of internalized biotinylated anti-GFP antibody with streptavidin. YFP-PrP* NRK cells were incubated for 2 h with 500 nM bafilomycin A1 with 1 μg/mL antibody (Ab) (lane 1) or, as a negative control, without antibody (lane 2). To generate the antibody control lane (“Ab ctrl”), the biotinylated anti-GFP antibody was diluted directly into sample buffer to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/mL, and then 15 μL was run on the gel, resulting in 3 ng loaded into the gel. The same membrane was imaged for total protein using the Stain-Free TM system, then probed with Streptavidin-DyLight800, and a homemade rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, which was previously described [19,20] and detected using HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Next, we tested whether we could detect differences in anti-GFP antibody uptake by YFP-PrP* NRK cells, untransfected parental NRK cells, and YFP-CD3δ NRK cells based on the trafficking concepts diagrammed in Figure 3 . To provide an internal measurement guide, we included a dilution curve of YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates from cells that were incubated with bafilomycin A1 and anti-GFP antibody during steady-state conditions ( Figure 5A , B, lanes 1–5). We generated this dilution curve by diluting lysate in 2× SB+TCEP prior to running it on the gel. Since heavy- and light-chains are stoichiometric in functional antibodies [42,43], we opted to measure the band intensities of only the 50 kDa biotinylated heavy chains that were stained by Streptavidin-DyLight800. We normalized measurements against the 1× dilution of the cell lysate. This dilution curve reveals that while this western blot approach is semi-quantitative, it is useful to estimate decreases or increases in internalized antibody levels. Furthermore, using this approach, we detected the expected increase in anti-GFP antibody uptake that occurs upon the additional treatment of YFP-PrP* NRK cells with TG. Our results suggest that TG-treatment increased anti-GFP antibody uptake ( Figure 5A , B, compare lanes 6 and 7). Critically, TG-treatment only induced an obvious increase in anti-GFP antibody uptake by YFP-PrP* NRK cells, but not by the negative controls, including untransfected parental NRK cells or the YFP-CD3δ-expressing NRK cells ( Figure 5A , B, compare lanes 6 and 7 to 8–11). This verifies the specificity of the anti-GFP antibody for the extracellularly exposed YFP-tag of the YFP-PrP*. Figure 5. Proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating the expected differences in anti-GFP antibody uptake as detected by our western blot–based approach. (A) Western blot of YFP-PrP* NRK, parental NRK, or YFP-CD3δ NRK cell lysates from cells that were incubated for 2 h with 500 nM Bafilomycin A1, 1 μg/mL antibody (Ab), and 0.1 μM TG as indicated. Lanes 1–5 represent a dilution curve of the YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates that were incubated for 2 h with 500 nM bafilomycin A1 and 1 μg/mL Ab. The same membrane was imaged for total protein using the Stain-Free TM system, then probed with Streptavidin-DyLight800 and rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. (B) Quantification of the Streptavidin-DyLight800-bound heavy chain bands of the internalized biotinylated anti-GFP antibody. All of the band intensities were normalized against the 1× dilution of the YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates. (C) Triplicate quantification of Streptavidin-DyLight800-bound heavy chain bands of the internalized biotinylated anti-GFP antibody. Data is described as means and standard deviations. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference when comparing each condition to the control condition (YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab, p < 0.05) using an ordinary one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. The initial ANOVA test resulted in a statistically significant difference between groups [p < 0.0001, F(3,8) = 51.07], and multiple comparisons with Dunnett’s corrections resulted in a significant difference between YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab vs. YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG (adjusted p = 0.0006); vs. NRK +Baf +Ab (adjusted p = 0.0077); and vs. YFP-CD3δ +Baf +Ab (adjusted p = 0.0046). All of the band intensities were normalized against the total protein loaded in the Stain-Free TM blot and also the 1× dilution of the YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates. Means and standard deviations for each condition are as follows: YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab, 1.000 ± 0.000; YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG, 2.202 ± 0.444; parental NRK +Baf +Ab, 0.199 ± 0.123; YFP-CD3δ NRK +Baf +Ab, 0.126 ± 0.080. Symbols represent each of the 3 trials. The circles correspond to the blot shown in (A). After determining that the anti-GFP antibody uptake by YFP-PrP* NRK cells is specifically due to the cell-surface exposure of the YFP-tag on YFP-PrP* in Figure 5A and B, we repeated a subset of the experimental conditions in triplicate for quantification ( Figure 5C ). Specifically, we measured anti-GFP antibody uptake for YFP-PrP* NRK cells that were cultured with bafilomycin A1 and anti-GFP antibodies (Ab) in the absence of TG (YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab) or presence of TG (YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG). We measured two negative controls, parental untransfected and YFP-CD3δ NRK cells cultured with bafilomycin A1 and anti-GFP antibodies (NRK +Baf +Ab and YFP-CD3δ +Baf +Ab, respectively). Triplicate quantifications revealed that in YFP-PrP* NRK cells, approximately double the amount of anti-GFP antibodies are internalized upon TG-treatment. This suggests that twice as many molecules of YFP-PrP* traffic through the PM within the 2-h period when RESET is induced with TG. The negative controls demonstrated a low level of nonspecific antibody uptake during the 2-h incubation. Taken together, we have demonstrated the utility of our western blot–based approach to detect specific antibody uptake and increased antibody uptake in response to a small molecule that promotes the traffic of an integral membrane protein of interest to the PM ( Figure 5 ). We then set out to demonstrate the utility of our protocol to detect inhibition of YFP-PrP* trafficking to the PM in response to a small molecule drug. As previously published, 3 h of pretreatment with BRD4780 induces degradation of TMED9 and blocks traffic of YFP-PrP* through the RESET pathway [18]. Thus, we expected that a 3-h BRD4780-pretreatment would block the consequent anti-GFP antibody uptake during steady-state and TG-treatment conditions ( Figure 3D , E). BRD4780-pretreatment visibly induced the degradation of TMED9 ( Figure 6A , TMED9-blot, compare lanes 6–7 with 8–9). To provide an internal measurement guide for antibody uptake, we included a dilution curve of YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates from cells that were incubated with bafilomycin A1 and anti-GFP antibody ( Figure 6A , lanes 1–5). We measured the band intensities of the 50 kDa biotinylated heavy chains that were stained by Streptavidin-DyLight800 and normalized the measurements against the 1× dilution of the cell lysate ( Figure 6A , B, Streptavidin-DyLight800 blot, compare lanes 1–9 with lane 3). As predicted for conditions in which RESET was blocked with BRD4780, we detected a sharp decrease in antibody uptake after the 3-h BRD4780 pretreatment of YFP-PrP* NRK cells ( Figure 6A , B, Streptavidin-DyLight800-blot, compare lanes 6 and 8). Despite demonstrating the expected increase of antibody uptake in TG-treated cells ( Figure 6A , B, Streptavidin-DyLight800-blot, compare lanes 6 and 8), the 3-h BRD4780 pretreatment inhibited TG-induced antibody uptake ( Figure 6A , B, Streptavidin-DyLight800-blot, compare lanes 7 and 9). To quantify the effects of BRD4780 on antibody uptake and YFP-PrP* levels, we performed the experiment in triplicate ( Figure 6C , D). As shown previously ( Figure 5C ), anti-GFP antibody uptake in YFP-PrP* NRK cells approximately doubled in the presence of TG YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG when compared to baseline-levels YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab ( Figure 6C ). However, anti-GFP antibody uptake was inhibited in cells with 3-h BRD4780 pretreatment in the absence of TG YFP-PrP* BRD4780 P-T +Baf +Ab or the presence of TG YFP-PrP* BRD4780 P-T +Baf +Ab +TG ( Figure 6C ). Taken together, we have demonstrated the utility of our western blot–based approach to detect decreased antibody uptake in response to a small molecule that inhibits traffic of an integral membrane protein of interest to the PM ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6. Proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating the expected decrease in anti-GFP antibody uptake after BRD4780 treatment as detected by our western blot–based approach. (A) Western blot of YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates from cells that were incubated for 2 h with 500 nM bafilomycin A1, 1 μg/mL antibody (Ab), 100 μM BRD4780, and 0.1 μM TG as indicated. For conditions with BRD4780 treatment, a 3-h pretreatment was included prior to the 2-h coincubation with bafilomycin, antibody, and TG as indicated. Lanes 1–5 represent a dilution curve of the YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates that were incubated for 2 h with 500 nM bafilomycin A1 and 1 μg/mL antibody (Ab). The membrane was imaged for total protein using the Stain-Free TM system, and then probed with Streptavidin-DyLight800. A second membrane was probed with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and with mouse anti-TMED9 antibody, followed by a fluorescent anti-mouse secondary antibody.

(C) Quantification of streptavidin-DyLight800-bound heavy chain bands of the internalized biotinylated anti-GFP antibody. Data is presented as means and standard deviations (n = 3). Four asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference when comparing each condition to the control condition (YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab, p < 0.0001) using an ordinary one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. The initial ANOVA test resulted in a significant difference between groups [p < 0.0001, F(3,8) = 154.3)], and multiple comparisons with Dunnett’s corrections resulted in a significant difference between YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab vs. YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG (adjusted p < 0.0001); vs. YFP-PrP* +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab (adjusted p < 0.0001); and vs. YFP-PrP* +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab +TG (adjusted p < 0.0001). All of the band intensities were normalized against the total protein loaded in the stain-free blot and also the 1× dilution of the YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates. Means and standard deviations are as follows: YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab, 1.000 ± 0; YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG, 1.876 ± 0.2080; YFP-PrP* +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab, 0.1989 ± 0.4944; YFP-PrP* +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab +TG, 0.1826 ± 0.06759. Symbols represent each of the three trials. The circles correspond to the blot shown in (A). (D) Quantification of anti-GFP antibody detecting YFP-PrP* western blot bands. Data is presented as means and standard deviations (n = 3). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab (p < 0.05) using an ordinary one-way ANOVA test comparing each group to the control condition (YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab) with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. Four asterisks indicate p < 0.0001, two asterisks indicate p < 0.005. The initial ANOVA test resulted in a significant difference between groups [p < 0.0001, F(3,8) = 36.24], and multiple comparisons with Dunnett’s corrections resulted in a significant difference between YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab vs. YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG (adjusted p = 0.0044); and vs. YFP-PrP* +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab +TG (adjusted p < 0.0001). All of the band intensities were normalized against the total protein loaded in the stain-free blot and also the 1× dilution of the YFP-PrP* NRK cell lysates. Symbols represent each of the three trials. The circles correspond to the blot shown in (A). Means and standard deviations are as follows: YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab, 1.000 ± 0; YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab +TG, 0.5745 ± 0.1544; YFP-PrP* +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab, 0.8372 ± 0.1618; YFP-PrP* +BRD4780 +Baf +Ab +TG, 0.1036 ± 0.02773. An exciting observation revealed by this proof-of-principle experiment was that TG-treatment in 3-h BRD4780-pretreated cells induced rapid degradation of YFP-PrP*, despite coincubation of TG with the lysosomal degradation inhibitor bafilomycin A1 ( Figure 6A , B, GFP-blot, compare lanes 6 and 9). Triplicate analysis and quantification of the GFP blots revealed that YFP-PrP* levels did not change significantly in the presence of the 3-h BRD4780 pretreatment YFP-PrP* BRD4780 P-T +Baf +Ab when compared to baseline-levels YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab ( Figure 6D ). However, the combination of BRD4780 and TG YFP-PrP* BRD4780 P-T +Baf +Ab +TG induced a significant drop in the YFP-PrP* levels when compared to baseline-levels YFP-PrP* +Baf +Ab ( Figure 6D ). Thus, Figure 6 demonstrates that under conditions in which RESET is blocked, YFP-PrP* is degraded through an alternate pathway that (a) does not involve trafficking to the cell surface and (b) is not inhibited by bafilomycin A1. The depletion in YFP-PrP* levels in the presence of lysosomal degradation inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, suggests that this alternate pathway may not involve lysosomal degradation. Further studies will need to be performed in order to determine the mechanism underlying this new observation. Notably, the results in Figure 6 demonstrate that this new western blot–based antibody-uptake protocol facilitates new discoveries relating to protein trafficking pathways, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, we have used YFP-PrP* as a model substrate to demonstrate how biotinylated antibody uptake can be used to monitor integral protein trafficking to and internalization from the PM ( Figure 1 , bold purple arrows). To validate our new western blot–based antibody-uptake protocol, we took advantage of previous findings that tagged variants of PrP* that are efficiently endocytosed from the PM and that traffic to the PM can be pharmacologically modified ( Figure 3B –E). Using this western blot–based biotinylated antibody uptake assay, we replicated the expected findings that TG or BRD4780 promote or inhibit YFP-PrP* trafficking to the PM, respectively. Interestingly, Figure 6 revealed that pretreatment with BRD4780 reroutes YFP-PrP* degradation through a pathway that does not involve trafficking to the cell surface and is not inhibited by bafilomycin A1. While performing these protocol validation experiments, we demonstrated and exploited the following benefits of our western blot–based approach to detect antibody uptake: (a) the accessibility of SDS-PAGE and western blot equipment and reagents, (b) the high binding affinity of streptavidin for biotinylated proteins and specificity surpassing that of traditional primary–secondary antibody pairs, (c) the relatively short training time for a new student to learn the entire workflow, (d) the short turnaround time from sample collection to quantified streptavidin bands, and (e) the semi-quantitative nature of western blots. Thus, we demonstrate here the facility of this protocol to make new discoveries relating to integral membrane protein trafficking pathways and degradation. This protocol may be easily adjusted to use with other adherent or non-adherent cell lines and primary or differentiated cell cultures, to monitor antibody uptake by any integral membrane protein.",

        "caption": "(A–G) Starting from the left side of the image, each shape is labeled the first time that it appears in the figure. The “KEY” provides a magnified view of the features of the biotinylated primary antibody, YFP-PrP*, and YFP-CD3δ. The p24-family members, TMED9, TMED2, and TMP21, are depicted to hetero-oligomerize with each other and possibly other p24-family members, and constitutively cycle between the ER and Golgi [35–37], unless they are selectively degraded upon BRD4780-treatment [28–30]. Calnexin (CNX) is an ER-resident chaperone [38–41]. (B–E) The italicized “ ERAD? ERLAD ?” indicates that a role for these degradation pathways was not previously detected or investigated. (A) Parental (untransfected) NRK cells would not be expected to internalize detectable levels of anti-GFP antibodies because they do not express an FP (e.g., YFP) tagged integral membrane protein (e.g., YFP-PrP*). (B) During steady-state conditions in YFP-PrP* NRK cells, CNX strongly associates with the misfolded GPI-anchored protein YFP-PrP*. Occasionally, CNX releases YFP-PrP* and YFP-PrP* engages with the p24-family members to undergo ER-to-Golgi export via the RESET pathway. From the Golgi, YFP-PrP* gains access to the cell surface, where it can bind and internalize anti-GFP antibodies. (C) Thapsigargin (TG)-treatment induces rapid release of the entire population of YFP-PrP* from CNX for the RESET pathway, allowing for increased anti-GFP antibody uptake. (D) Three-hour BRD4780-pretreatment shuts down the RESET pathway by inducing the degradation of the requisite RESET factors, TMED9, TMED2, and TMP21. Thus, BRD4780-pretreatment would be expected to block constitutive turnover of YFP-PrP* via RESET and thereby prevent anti-GFP antibody uptake. (E) Three-hour BRD4780-pretreatment of YFP-PrP* NRK cells shuts down RESET. Thus, coincubation of BRD4780-pretreated YFP-PrP* NRK cells with TG, which forces YFP-PrP* release from CNX, would be expected to increase the rate of YFP-PrP* degradation via an alternate internal pathway. (F) During steady-state conditions, CNX occasionally releases the integral membrane protein, YFP-CD3δ. However, YFP-CD3δ is a well-characterized ERAD substrate that was shown not to undergo ER-export or RESET. Thus, we expect that YFP-CD3δ would not access the cell surface and internalize the anti-GFP antibody. (G) TG-treatment is known to increase the rate of ERAD of YFP-CD3δ. YFP-CD3δ does not undergo RESET and therefore would not be expected to internalize anti-GFP antibody.",

    "title": "Quantitative, Dynamic Detection of Neuronal Na+ Transients Using Multi-photon Excitation and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) in Acute Mouse Brain Slices.",
    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a highly valuable technique in the fluorescence microscopy toolbox because it is essentially independent of indicator concentrations. Conventional fluorescence microscopy analyzes changes in emission intensity. In contrast, FLIM assesses the fluorescence lifetime, which is defined as the time a fluorophore remains in an excited state before emitting a photon. This principle is advantageous in experiments where fluorophore concentrations are expected to change, e.g., due to changes in cell volume. FLIM, however, requires collecting a substantial number of photons to accurately fit distribution plots, which constrains its ability for dynamic imaging. This limitation has recently been overcome by rapidFLIM, which utilizes ultra-low dead-time photodetectors in conjunction with sophisticated rapid electronics. The resulting reduction in dead-time to the picosecond range greatly enhances the potential for achieving high spatio-temporal resolution. Here, we demonstrate the use of multi-photon-based rapidFLIM with the sodium indicator ION NaTRIUM Green-2 (ING-2) for the quantitative, dynamic determination of Na+ concentrations in neurons in acute rodent brain tissue slices. We describe the loading of the dye into neurons and present a procedure for its calibration in situ. We show that rapidFLIM not only allows the unbiased determination of baseline Na+ concentrations but also allows dynamic imaging of changes in intracellular Na+, e.g., induced by inhibition of cellular ATP production. Overall, rapidFLIM, with its greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio and higher spatio-temporal resolution, will also facilitate dynamic measurements using other FLIM probes, particularly those with a low quantum yield. Key features • RapidFLIM of the sodium indicator ING-2 enables the intensity-independent recording of neuronal Na+ transients at unparalleled full frame rates of 0.5-1 Hz. • RapidFLIM is essentially independent of dye concentrations and therefore not affected by dye bleaching. • Full in situ calibrations enable the quantification of intracellular Na+ changes at high spatio-temporal resolution. • RapidFLIM of ING-2 allows unbiased determination of cellular Na+ loading also in conditions of strong cell swelling.",

To maintain a pH of 7.4, ACSF must be continuously bubbled with carbogen (95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ) ( Figure 2 , step 2). 3. After the separation of the hemispheres, make an additional incision in a parasagittal orientation (approximately 1.5 mm thick). Affix the tissue block containing the hippocampus with glue to the cutting stage of the microtome at the parasagittal incision. Place the cutting stage into the microtome and cool (ideally with a non-dissolving cooling element) ( Figure 2 , step 3). 4. Prepare hippocampal slices with a thickness of 250 μm, keeping the tissue constantly submerged in ice-cold preparation ACSF ( Figure 2 , step 4). 5. Transfer the slices very gently to ACSF containing 1 μM SR101 at 34 °C for 20 min, during which they will take up the astrocyte marker. Following this, incubate the slices at 34 °C for a further 10 min in standard ACSF. Slices can be used for experiments for approximately 5–7 h if kept at room temperature ( Figure 2 , step 5). Figure 2. Protocol for acute brain slice preparation. 1. Brain isolation starts by cutting along the illustrated dashed lines. Note: It is necessary to work fast to minimize the time period in which the brain is not submerged in ice-cold ACSF (see below). Always use maximum care to prevent damage to the tissue probes. 2. Excess tissue is removed with additional trimming cuts as depicted by dashed lines. 3. Parasagittal trimming is achieved by cutting a single hemisphere at a 45° angle. 4. The hemisphere is glued to the vibratome cutting stage and placed in the buffer tray filled with ice-cold, carbonated modified ACSF. 5. Freshly cut slices are placed onto a mesh positioned in a beaker filled with modified, ice-cold ACSF. 6. Just before starting experiments, slices are positioned in the experimental chamber and secured with a fine grid. 7. Bolus-loading of hippocampal CA1 region. B. Bolus-loading of ING-2 into hippocampal brain slices Note: This technique was initially developed for in vivo loading of dyes into brain cells [16]. It has since been adapted for use with acute brain slices and is employed by numerous research laboratories, including our own. 1. Prepare pipettes for dye injection (tip diameter of approximately 1 μm and a resistance of 1–3 MΩ) from fire-polished borosilicate glass capillaries using a standard micropipette puller. 2. Place a hippocampal brain slice into a microscope chamber and fix it with a “harp” (e.g., ALA Scientific HSG-5A) ( Figure 2 , step 6). After placing the chamber in your imaging system, constantly perfuse the brain slice with standard ACSF (typical perfusion rate is 2 mL/min). 3. Load an injection pipette with bolus-loading solution (see Recipes) and attach the pipette to the pressure application device. 4. Position the pipette with care and the help of a micromanipulator into your region of choice in the tissue ( Figure 2 , step 7). Dye injection should be close to the cellular region you are interested in, usually in the same field of view. For loading of somata of neurons in the CA1 pyramidal area, the dye injection pipette should be positioned, e.g., in the stratum radiatum, just below the CA1 pyramidal layer ( Figure 3 , step 1). Apply ~1.5 psi for ~5 s to inject the dye into the tissue. This process should be repeated until the entire field of view is covered ( Figure 3 , step 1). 5. Wait for 30–45 min to engage intracellular de-esterification and wash off excess dye from the extracellular space, constantly perfusing the brain slice with standard ACSF. Figure 3. Calibration process. 1. Inject ING-2 at the region of interest. Here, a fluorescence lifetime image of the CA1 region of a hippocampal tissue slice is shown. Pipettes and approximate areas, dye-loaded by one injection, are indicated in white. 2. Perfuse the slice with Na + -free saline to wash out extracellular Na + . 3. Perfuse with 0 Na + calibration solution containing ionophores to equilibrate intra- and extracellular Na + . 4. Continue perfusion with calibration solutions at different Na + concentrations. 5. Plot the resulting lifetimes against Na + using appropriate software (e.g., Origin Pro). 6. Fit the resulting data to determine the apparent K D(app) and dynamic range of the dye. Modified and taken from [3]. C. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of ING-2 and multi-photon excitation 1. Choose suitable parameters for imaging for your given imaging system and the specific dye used. With multiphoton excitation, ING-2 can be excited over a broad wavelength spectrum from 740 to 1,100 nm. Typical parameters for ING-2 used in our experiments are an excitation wavelength of 840 nm, an image size of 512 × 512 pixels, and an imaging frequency of 1 Hz. Note 1: The whole setup should be tuned for maximum photon efficacy. The more photons that can be recorded, the better the spatio-temporal resolution will be. Temporal resolution is always relative, as the recorded frames can be binned afterward. However, a minimum number of photons (for Na + -sensitive dyes 15–20 photons per pixel and frame) need to be recorded for proper lifetime calculation. Note 2: The setup process before every experiment is crucial to obtain high-quality results. Make sure that the laser power under the objective does not exceed 5 mW. Use appropriate emission filters and dichroic mirrors to ensure optimal detection conditions. For ING-2, emission can be collected above 560 nm wavelength. 2. Measure the instrument response function (IRF) of your microscope with the IRF solution (see Recipes) using comparable photon counts as during experimental conditions (e.g., same laser power). 3. Select your region of interest in your tissue preparation. Critical: Make sure that your tissue sample is healthy and that many viable neurons are present. Injured neurons are usually characterized by their swollen cell bodies. Moreover, dendrites may be distorted and not be clearly visible. 4. Record an image (e.g., an average of 30 frames) in standard ACSF to check initial conditions. 5. Start a time series in standard ACSF and record fluorescence lifetime in baseline conditions (e.g., for 30 s). 6. Next, record a time series performing your manipulation of choice to test if this results in a change in fluorescence lifetimes (and intracellular Na + ). As a positive control, bath application of glutamate (e.g., 1 mM glutamate for 10 s) causes reliable and prominent intracellular Na + signals in rodent hippocampal slices [17]. Moreover, bath application of inhibitors of cellular ATP production induces long-lasting and large increases in intracellular Na + in the same preparation [2,3,18]. Alternatively, substances can be focally applied to a soma or a dendrite. This is usually done with a fine glass pipette (comparable to the ones used in section B for bolus application but with a smaller tip diameter) that is filled with the substance of choice (e.g., 1 mM glutamate). The application duration can be a lot shorter in comparison to bath applications and is usually below 1 s [3,19,20]. 7. Check if the changes induced by the manipulation are reversible, i.e., if fluorescence lifetimes recover to the initial baseline levels. After the lifetimes have returned to initial values for at least 30 frames, stop the time series. 8. Take another image (e.g., again an average of 30 frames) to compare starting and finishing conditions in standard ACSF. D. Calibrating changes in lifetime to changes in Na + Note: The general calibration routine for Na + -sensitive indicator dyes was described in detail by Rose and Ransom [21] for cultured astrocytes. It was later adapted for acute hippocampal brain slices and widefield and confocal as well as multi-photon microscopy [3,22,23]. This protocol was first used for FLIM by Meyer et al. [2]. 1. Prepare calibration solutions with different Na + concentrations, ranging from unsaturated (0 mM Na + ) to saturated (>100 mM Na + ) concentrations. Caution: Select a frame rate and laser power, which enables the collection of sufficient photons under all conditions. 2. Start perfusing a dye-loaded tissue slice ( Figure 3 , step 1) with standard ACSF and then switch to 0 mM Na + solution without the ionophores and ouabain to wash out Na + from the tissue ( Figure 3 , step 2). 3. Record the resulting changes in fluorescence lifetime. 4. Then, perfuse the slice with 0 mM Na + solution containing the ionophores and ouabain to promote washout of Na + from the cells and to enable equilibration of Na + between intra- and extracellular space ( Figure 3 , step 3). 5. Switch to calibration salines containing different Na + concentrations (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 mM), again recording changes in fluorescence lifetime resulting from the changes in Na + ( Figure 3 , step 4). Note: Always wait before switching to the next concentration until a stable plateau has been reached. You might need to adjust the focus of your microscope during the calibration process. 6. Plot the changes in lifetime against Na + and use a Michaelis–Menten equation to fit the data points and to determine the apparent K d and the dynamic range/saturation of the dye used ( Figure 3 , step 5). 7. The resulting fit will also allow you to directly convert fluorescence lifetime values obtained during different experiments into Na + concentrations ( Figure 3 , step 6).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research articles: • Meyer et al. [2]. Quantitative Determination of Cellular [Na + ] By Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging With CoroNaGreen. Journal of General Physiology . • Meyer et al. [3]. Rapid Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Reveals That TRPV4 Channels Promote Dysregulation of Neuronal Na + in Ischemia. Journal of Neuroscience . These two publications illustrate and describe the above-mentioned in situ calibrations in detail, also providing approaches for dye calibration in vitro. Meyer et al. [3] described rapidFLIM in rodent brain tissue slices, also demonstrating that this technique enables reliable, unbiased determination of baseline Na + concentrations in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Moreover, Meyer et al. [3] presented different manipulations to induce reversible changes in neuronal Na + and their recording by rapidFLIM. Figure 4 shows that inhibition of cellular metabolism by perfusing tissue slices with glucose-free saline containing inhibitors of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation results in large increases in Na + in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

    "title": "Accurate Identification of Cell Cycle Stages in RPE1 Cells Using the ImmunoCellCycle-ID Method.",
    "abstract": "Accurate identification of cell cycle stages is essential for investigating fundamental biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. While flow cytometry remains a widely used technique for such analyses, it is limited by its lack of single-cell resolution and its requirement for large sample sizes due to its population-based approach. These limitations underscore the need for alternative or complementary methods that offer single-cell precision with compatibility for small-scale applications. We present ImmunoCellCycle-ID, an immunofluorescence-based method that leverages the spatial distribution of endogenous markers, such as DNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), centromere protein F (CENP-F), and centromere protein C (CENP-C), to reliably distinguish G1, early S, late S, early G2, late G2, and all mitotic sub-stages. This technique does not rely on precise signal quantification and utilizes standard immunofluorescence protocols alongside conventional laboratory microscopes, ensuring broad accessibility. Importantly, ImmunoCellCycle-ID detects endogenous proteins without the need for genetic modification, making it readily applicable to a wide range of human cell lines. Beyond its utility for single-cell resolution, the method can be scaled for population-level analyses, similar to flow cytometry. With its precision, versatility, and ease of implementation, ImmunoCellCycle-ID offers a powerful tool for high-resolution cell cycle profiling across diverse experimental platforms. Key features • Enables high-precision identification of cell cycle stages at single-cell resolution. • Broadly applicable to diverse human cell lines without genetic modification. • Fully compatible with standard fluorescence microscopy; no specialized equipment needed. • Requires only minimal image analysis and no complex quantification.",

Once cells reach approximately 80% confluency (logarithmic growth phase), proceed to fixation (see General note 4). B. Fixation and immunostaining 1. Chill methanol at -20 °C for at least 20 min prior to use. 2. Fix cells with pre-chilled 100% methanol for 15 min at -20 °C. Ensure that coverslips are completely submerged in methanol (see General note 5). 3. Wash cells three times with PBS using enough solution to fully cover the coverslips (see General note 6 ). 4. Incubate cells in blocking solution at room temperature for 5 min. 5. Dilute primary antibodies in PBS using the concentrations listed in the Materials and Reagents section. 6. Incubate the primary antibody solution for 1.5 h at room temperature in the humidity chamber (see General Note 7 ). 7. Wash cells three times with PBS. 8. Dilute secondary antibodies in PBS using the concentrations listed in the Materials and Reagents section. 9. Incubate with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in the humidity chamber. 10. Wash cells three times with PBS. 11. Counterstain DNA with DAPI (3 μg/mL) for 15 min at room temperature. 12. Wash cells three times with PBS. 13. Mount coverslips using homemade mounting medium. C. Imaging and data collection 1. Turn on the spinning disk confocal system and place the slide glass with mounted, stained coverslips on the stage. 2. Use live mode with 405 nm excitation to adjust the focus. Then, optimize the laser power and camera exposure time for all wavelengths (405, 488, 561, and 640 nm) to prevent signal saturation. Determine the upper and lower z-axis limits of the cells, set the z-step size to 200–300 nm, and acquire images. 3. Move to the next desired imaging locations, adjust the focus and z-axis limits as needed, and acquire images. D. Image and data analysis for cell cycle staging 1. Analyze using raw images using NIS-Elements software (see General Note 8 ). 2. Identify cell cycle stages based on the following marker patterns (see Figure 2 ): G1 phase : The nucleus displays uniform PCNA signals but lacks CENP-F signals. Early S phase : The nucleus exhibits weak, uniform CENP-F signals and distinct, small punctate PCNA foci. Late S phase : The nucleus shows weak, uniform CENP-F signals and coarse punctate PCNA foci. Early G2 phase : The nucleus presents strong, uniform CENP-F signals and weak, uniform PCNA signals, similar in intensity to those seen in G1 phase. CENP-C signals become approximately twice as bright as in G1. Late G2 phase : Marker patterns are similar to early G2, but CENP-C signals now appear as distinct paired foci. Mitotic phases : Prophase : DNA begins to condense, and CENP-F appears as foci at kinetochores (uniform nuclear signals are absent). Prometaphase : The nuclear envelope breaks down (NEBD), and condensed mitotic chromatin (chromosomes) begins aligning at the cell equator. Metaphase : All chromosomes are fully aligned at the metaphase plate. Anaphase : Sister chromatids segregate toward opposite poles. Telophase : Chromatin decondenses, and nuclear structures begin to reform.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article: Chen et al.

    "title": "Imaging Single-Cell Ca2+ Dynamics of Brainstem Neurons and Glia in Freely Behaving Mice.",
    "abstract": "In vivo brain imaging, using a combination of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators and gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens, is a transformative technology that has become an increasingly potent research tool over the last decade. It allows direct visualisation of the dynamic cellular activity of deep brain neurons and glia in conscious animals and avoids the effect of anaesthesia on the network. This technique provides a step change in brain imaging where fibre photometry combines the whole ensemble of cellular activity, and multiphoton microscopy is limited to imaging superficial brain structures either under anaesthesia or in head-restrained conditions. We have refined the intravital imaging technique to image deep brain nuclei in the ventral medulla oblongata, one of the most difficult brain structures to image due to the movement of brainstem structures outside the cranial cavity during free behaviour (head and neck movement), whose targeting requires GRIN lens insertion through the cerebellum-a key structure for balance and movement. Our protocol refines the implantation method of GRIN lenses, giving the best possible approach to image deep extracranial brainstem structures in awake rodents with improved cell rejection/acceptance criteria during analysis. We have recently reported this method for imaging the activity of retrotrapezoid nucleus and raphe neurons to outline their chemosensitive characteristics. This revised method paves the way to image challenging brainstem structures to investigate their role in complex behaviours such as breathing, circulation, sleep, digestion, and swallowing, and could be extended to image and study the role of cerebellum in balance, movement, motor learning, and beyond. Key features • We developed a protocol that allows imaging from brainstem neurons and glia in freely behaving rodents. • Our refined method of GRIN lenses implantation and cell sorting approach gives the highest number of cells with the least postoperative complications. • The revised deep brainstem imaging method paves way to understand complex behaviours such as cardiorespiratory regulation, sleep, swallowing, and digestion. • Our protocol can be implemented to image cerebellar structures to understand their role in key functions such as balance, movement, motor learning, and more.",

This is followed by the procedure for Ca 2+ imaging in freely moving mice and data analysis. Presurgical calibration Calculate and validate the injection coordinates before viral injection, using fluorescent bead or dye injections to confirm coordinates for both viral injection and implantation of the lens. Calculate the viral titre by injecting different concentrations of virus and imaging the GCaMP expression. Ideally, cell somata should express the GCaMP without much expression in nuclei ( Figure 1 ). This is critical to make sure viral titre is not too low (as it will not give a sufficient signal) nor too high (as it will compromise neuronal activity and health) during core recording experiments. Figure 1. Viral titre and GCaMP expression. Examples of high (A), moderate (B), and low (C) syn-GCaMP expressing cells. Scale bar, 20 μm. Presurgical preparation for aseptic surgery Autoclave all surgical tools, drapes, cotton buds, foil, and tissue to be used in the surgery. Drape the equipment and area used for storing all surgical tools and sterile consumables with autoclaved surgical drapes. Cover all the surfaces that will be handled/touched during surgery with sterile aluminium foil or cling film i.e., microscope head and bar, stereotaxic frame knobs, etc. Viral transfection Initial animal surgical preparation. Check and report the weight of the animal before surgery. Ideally, adult male or female mice between 8 and 12 weeks old are used. Place the animal in the anaesthesia induction chamber (connected to the scavenger) with 4% isoflurane balanced with oxygen (4 L/min). Once the animal is anesthetised, transfer it over to the stereotaxic apparatus. Place the animal prone onto the stereotax, put teeth into bite bar, and connect to the isoflurane nosecone to maintain anaesthesia throughout the surgery [0.5%–2% isoflurane in pure oxygen (1 L/min)]. Give a presurgical subcutaneous injection of atropine (120 μg/kg) and meloxicam (2 mg/kg) prepared in sterile 0.9% saline solution. Atropine reduces bronchial secretion and keeps the trachea clear. Meloxicam provides long-term analgesic effects due to its longer half-life (20 h). Lubricate the thermocouple probe in lubricating jelly, insert it into the animal’s rectum to regulate the body temperature. Body temperature is maintained at ~33 °C to reduce bleeding and improve recovery. Cover the animal’s eyes with eye ointment to prevent drying and protect from the light. Fix the animal’s head into the ear bars. Trim hair over the head. Wet shave the surgical area with a double-sided razor blade, using a cotton swab to apply either 70% ethanol or vetscrub. Sterilise the surgical area of skin over the head with three alternating scrubs of vetscrub and 70% ethanol: always start with vetscrub as it can cause contact dermatitis if not removed with the ethanol. The surgeon should dress for aseptic surgery: hair net, facemask, sterile gloves, and autoclaved surgical gown. The surgeon may be aided by a non-sterile assistant throughout the surgery. Cover the animal in a cling film or sterile drape. Virus injection. Make a sagittal incision down the skull of approximately 1–1.5 cm so that bregma and the injection site can be accessed. Remove all the connective tissues from the top of the skull using a sterile cotton-tip applicator ( Figure 2A ). Place an empty capillary into the holder and adjust the skull position so that bregma is level with 2 mm caudal to bregma. We checked the skull’s left-right levelling at 1 mm laterally; ± 40 μm variation is acceptable. Drill a hole at the stereotaxically designated position from bregma. To target brainstem nuclei, change the stereotaxic arm anteroposterior angle up to approximately 10° to achieve the desired targeted injection. For example, the coordinates for the retrotrapezoid nucleus with a 9° stereotaxic arm anteroposterior angle are -1.0 mm lateral and -5.6 mm caudal from Bregma and -5.5 mm ventral from the surface of the cerebellum ( Figure 2B ). Load the capillary with viral solution and place in the capillary holder. Volume of injection depends on the target region. Generally, smaller and tighter injections (50–200 nL) are better for the specificity. Connect the capillary to plastic tubing connecting to a pressure delivery system, e.g., a 1 mL syringe or a picospritzer. Place the tip at bregma for calculating coordinates. Move the capillary tip to the desired injection site (keeping in mind the angle of the capillary holder). Lower the capillary into the drill hole. i. Zero the Z coordinates at the surface of the brain. ii. Do not keep the capillary touching the brain surface for too long, as this may lead to blockage of the capillary with keratin in the cerebral spinal fluid. Insert the capillary to the desired Z coordinates. Gently apply pressure through the system. Make sure to observe the movement of viral solution meniscus in the capillary through the microscope. Adjust the pressure accordingly to inject viral solution at a speed of approximately 100 nL/min ( Figure 2C ). Keep the capillary in place for 3–5 min after injection to prevent backflow up the capillary track and to allow time for virus to spread at the tip of capillary. Gently remove the capillary. Pull the skin together and seal the wound with tissue adhesive. Remove the animal from the stereotaxic frame. Inject buprenorphine intraperitoneally (100 μg/kg prepared in sterile 0.9% saline solution). Place the animal back in the cage on a heating pad until recovery. Observe the animal until full recovery and monitor daily for postsurgical recovery for up to two weeks. Figure 2. Viral transfection.

GRIN lens implantation Prepare the animal as for steps B and C1. After the incision is made, remove an additional 1 mm of tissue from the cut edge ( Figure 3A ). This creates space for superbond to build around the lens. Using a sterile cotton-tip applicator, remove all the periosteum and connective tissue from the skull’s surface ( Figure 3A ). Place an empty capillary into the holder and adjust the skull position so that the bregma is level with 2 mm caudal to bregma and the skull is left-right level at 1 mm laterally; ± 40 μm variation is acceptable. Drill a hole at the stereotaxically designated position from bregma, big enough for the GRIN lens (Figure 3Be) to pass through ( crucial ). For our surgery, we used 0.6 mm diameter lens, and a hole size of approximately 0.7 mm was big enough to insert the lens through (the hole should be ~0.1 mm bigger than the lens diameter). The hole size can be checked by aligning the GRIN lens tip against the hole. It is crucial that the hole is not too big as this will not provide skull support to the lens and can allow superbond solution to enter the wound, causing postsurgical complications. Creating track for the GRIN lens ( crucial ). Creating a lens track is a very important and essential step, as insertion of the lens without creating a track applies pressure on the cerebellar and brainstem nuclei and leads to severe postoperative complications. The lens track is created by inserting an empty capillary (to a depth of ~3/4 of the lens track) from the cranial hole drilled at desired coordinates ( Figure 3C ). Place the blunt needle (Figure 3Bf) of an approximately similar diameter to the GRIN lens into the stereotaxic arm holder. Adjust the coordinates at bregma and move the needle tip over the hole. At this point, move a needle at the edge of the hole, touch its tip on the skull surface, and zero the Z coordinates. Then, move the needle to the desired lens implantation position and lower the needle until it touches the brain surface. Calculate the distance between skull surface and brain tissue. Touch the needle tip to the brain surface and make Z coordinates zero. Slowly (250 μm/min) insert the needle into the brain tissue until 250 μm, pull it back to zero, insert again until 250 μm, and place it in position for approximately 3 min. This initial insertion generates the pressure on cerebellum and gives time for the needle edges to cut through the brain tissue. After 3 min, drive the needle 500 μm ventrally and then retract the needle 250 μm. This creates a 250 μm stepwise needle insertion, which does not create excessive pressure on the brain. Perform the 250-μm insertion-retraction steps continuously. Stop the needle insertion approximately 300–500 μm above the target region of interest or 100 μm above where the tip of the GRIN lens will be. Keep the needle in place at last insertion for approximately 3 min. Keep in mind that the GRIN lens has a focal plane of approximately 300 ± 100 μm from the bottom surface of the lens [10]. Gently withdraw the needle ( Figure 3D ). Figure 3. Creating track for the gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens. A) Skin cut and skull top preparation for creating lens track and implantation.

C) Blunt needle insertion path through the brainstem and D) a track created after removing a blunt needle. Implantation of GRIN lens. Place the GRIN lens (Figure 3Be) into the holder (Figure 3Bc) attached to the stereotaxic arm and place the camera (Figure 3Ba) into the holder (Figure 3Bc) by removing the camera cap (Figure 3Bb). Adjust the centre of the GRIN lens surface at the bregma. Move the GRIN lens at the edge of the hole and lower it until it touches the skull surface. Then, move the lens to the desired XY coordinates, lower it down until it touches the brain surface [by a distance between the skull and the brain surface calculated above (2c)], and zero the Z-coordinates. Slowly insert the GRIN lens using the same insertion-retraction 250 μm steps described in step D2f. Do this until 1 mm depth and wait for 3 min at this point. From 1 mm onward, drive the lens 200 μm ventrally, then retract it by 100 μm and wait for 1 min before the next insertion. When the bottom surface of the lens is 500 μm from implantation site (~800 μm from the viral injection site), reduce the insertion speed to 50 μm/step (driving by 100 μm, retracting by 50 μm, and waiting for 1 min) ( Figure 4A ). Check the GCaMP expression during every insertion step by turning on the camera through the Inscopix Data Acquisition Software and DAC box (Figure 3Bi) so the fluorescence can be seen. Stop the lens insertion when GCaMP expression is good and shows increased whole Ca 2+ fluorescence ( Figure 4B ) compared to low signal ( Figure 4C ). This should be ~300 μm from the viral injection site. Keep in mind that cellular Ca 2+ dynamics are suppressed under anaesthesia and will not be very bright during lens implantation. The purpose of this is to ensure the best possible lens implantation distance from the cells of interest. The lens implantation step may be combined with the viral injection, but performing these as separate surgical procedures ensures the best possible lens implantation and the best possible cellular imaging outcome. Once the lens is in place, dry the skull surface with Kimwipes or a cotton swab. Mix the superbond polymer with monomer as per the kit’s instruction. Add the catalyst and mix well. Wait until the mixture thickens slightly to a gel-like consistency. Apply the mixture around and at the bottom surface of the lens. This is a very important step. Make sure to avoid application of the mixture to the lens holder (Figure 3Bc) and to keep it away from the animal’s eyes. This first application should cover the lens’s surface around the skull. Wait until the superbond is dry (this takes approximately 10 min; an alternative is to use UV fix superbond, which speeds up the process of solidifying polymer and monomer mixture). When the superbond is well dried, loosen the lens (Figure 3Be) from the lens holder (Figure 3Bc) and remove it. To do this, loosen the side screw on the holder that securely holds lens into the holder. Make sure that there is no superbond on the joint between lens holder and lens; otherwise, this will move the lens. Mix the second batch of superbond polymer and monomer. Wait until the mixture is of gel-like consistency, apply it along the skin edges, and build around the lens. Make sure that the superbond does not come above the lens’s top surface ( Figure 4D ). Wait until the superbond dries. Cover the lens top surface with an Eppendorf cap cut to the shape and adhere it there with PVA glue ( Figure 4D ) (alternatively, silicon adhesive can be used to cover the lens top surface) that can be removed during baseplate implantation surgery. This will protect the lens until the baseplate installation. After the second application of superbond has dried and cap is well sealed to the lens, take off the animal from stereotaxic frame, inject buprenorphine intraperitoneally, and place it back in the cage on a heating pad until recovery. Watch the animal until full recovery and monitor daily for postsurgical recovery for up to two weeks. Figure 4. Implantation of gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens. A) Slow insertion of GRIN lens through a track created using a blunt needle until a good GCaMP expression and cellular Ca 2+ dynamics are visible. Examples of a good (B) and an inadequate (C) GCaMP expression. D) Securing GRIN lens in a place using a good-quality dental cement. Lens top is covered with an Eppendorf cap cut to the shape and adhered with PVA glue. Scale bar, 50 μm. Baseplate implantation The animal will be anesthetised for the baseplate implantation surgery and placed in the stereotaxic frame as per step C1a–g of the viral injection protocol. However, this is a non-invasive surgery and therefore does not require the same sterility protocol as above. Implanting baseplate. Peel off the PVA glue to remove the lens cap. Clean the lens top surface with Kimwipes soaked in ethanol to remove any possible dirt from the surface of the GRIN lens. Attach the baseplate (Figure 3Bg) to the holder (Figure 3Bh) and place it in position in the stereotaxic arm. Stereotaxic skull levelling is not possible at this step; therefore, try to level the skull as much as possible. Attach the camera to the baseplate and move it near the lens surface ( Figure 5A ). Turn on the recording software and watch the live imaging. Adjust the GRIN lens top surface in the middle of the field of recording and lower the camera slowly until the lens surface is visible (take precautions during this step to not compress the camera lens on to any other surfaces and leave a clear gap between camera and GRIN lens). When the GRIN lens’ sharp edge is visible ( Figure 5B ) (at the lowest camera position), adjust the sharpness of all edges by moving the nose cone. This ensures that both the camera and lens surface are parallel to each other. Move the baseplate position away from the lens at the best possible field of view ( Figure 5C ). This is generally ~300 μm from the sharp edge. This field of view can be checked by gently touching the animal’s back, which possibly activates the cells to check the Ca 2+ signal ( Figure 5C ). Viral expression time varies from virus to virus and, therefore, may need extra time for the optimal expression. In this case, the animal can be returned back to the cage (by attaching cap to the lens) and be revisited for the baseplate surgery in a week’s time. When the baseplate is in position with an optimal GCaMP expression, mix the superbond polymer with monomer and add catalyst to it. When the mixture is of good consistency to form a layer between the side of the baseplate and superbond over the skull, apply it on the edges, making sure it does not run under the baseplate or touches the camera lens. This is a critical step. After the first application, wait until mixture is well dried. Loosen the screw on the baseplate that holds the camera. Retract the camera up and remove it from the stereotaxic holder. Apply the second layer of superbond to cover and seal all the gaps around the baseplate. If the superbond colour is not dark, then a black nail polish layer can be applied to make it opaque and prevent any light penetration under the baseplate. Once the baseplate is well fixed, attach the baseplate cover ( Figure 3B -d). Take the animal off from the stereotaxic frame and place it back in the cage on a heating pad until recovery. Watch the animal until full recovery and monitor it daily for at least one week before recordings start. Figure 5. Implantation of baseplate. A) Baseplate is attached to the skull over the gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens so that the best possible cellular Ca 2+ dynamics can be imaged. B) The GRIN lens’ sharp edge is visible when the camera is at its lowest position during baseplate implantation. C) Move the baseplate position away from the lens so that the cells can be seen with the best possible field of view. Scale bar, 50 μm. Mice training Train the mice with dummy camera in the environment where they will be recorded ( Figure 6A ). Training could last from 10 to 60 min and depends on the duration of the study protocol. One to three training sessions could be performed at least a day apart. Ca 2+ imaging in freely moving mice Attach the imaging camera to the animal’s head by docking it in the baseplate and tightening the side screw on the baseplate. Imaging: Set the recording parameters as desired to ensure the least LED power to prevent bleaching. Set the optimal recording frame rate [glial Ca 2+ transients are slower than neurons, hence can be recorded at slower frame rate (< 10 FPS)] and adjust the plane of focus to achieve the desired field of view for recording ( Figure 6C , D). This has been discussed in detail in the previous protocols and can be found in the manufacturer’s manual [12]. Place the animal in the recording environment, e.g., in plethysmographic chamber to test hypercapnic breathing response by measuring changes in breathing tidal volume and frequency ( Figure 6B ). Recording should be started depending on the study protocol. The study might require the animal to be settled in the recording environment before recording begins or it might require recording the activity as soon as the animal is placed in the environment. To measure the hypercapnic breathing response from chemosensitive neurons or glia, the animal will be allowed to settle in the plethysmographic chamber connected to a gas analyser (to analyse CO 2 and O 2 ) and pressure transducer to measure breathing volume. After the animal is settled, Ca 2+ imaging is started [through TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) pulse] and baseline breathing recorded followed by hypercapnic challenge and recovery. The duration of Ca 2+ imaging depends on the protocol. However, it is advisable to keep the recording duration as short as possible to avoid fluorophore bleaching. In our study, we have successfully recorded up to 15 min/session from the same mouse multiple times (keeping a week gap between recordings). However, imaging frequency and duration depends on the type of GCaMP indicator and camera imaging settings. Synchronised video recording: Real-time animal video can be recorded and synchronised with imaging data using TTL pulse script. Detailed description to set up TTL pulse can be found on CED-Spike2 website. The TTL pulse can be delivered to the DAC box to trigger the Ca 2+ imaging, and these can be synchronised during analysis. To start the TTL pulse, a command is given from the Spike software, and this will allow to see when the command was delivered. This command will start the Ca 2+ recording and, later, Ca 2+ imaging trace is aligned with the TTL pulse command on Spike recording (Spike recording could be EEG or any other feature such as plethysmographic trace).

    "title": "A Simple Immunofluorescence Method to Characterize Neurodegeneration and Tyrosine Hydroxylase Reduction in Whole Brain of a Drosophila Model of Parkinson's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Dopaminergic (DAergic) neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the human brain is the pathological feature associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Drosophila also exhibits mobility defects and diminished levels of brain dopamine on exposure to neurotoxicants mimicking PD. Our laboratory demonstrated in a Drosophila model of sporadic PD that there is no decrease in DAergic neuronal number; instead, there is a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) fluorescence intensity (FI). Here, we present a sensitive assay based on the quantification of FI of the secondary antibody (ab). As the FI is directly proportional to the amount of TH synthesis, its reduction under PD conditions denotes the decrease in the TH synthesis, suggesting DAergic neuronal dysfunction. Therefore, FI quantification is a refined and sensitive method to understand the early stages of DAergic neurodegeneration. FI quantification is performed using the ZEN 2012 SP2 single-user software; a license must be acquired to utilize the imaging system to interactively control image acquisition, image processing, and analysis. This method will be of good use to biologists, as it can also be used with little modification to characterize the extent of degeneration and changes in the level of degeneration in response to drugs in different cell types. Unlike the expensive and cumbersome confocal microscopy, the present method will be an affordable option for fund-constrained neurobiology laboratories. Key features • Allows characterizing the incipient DAergic and other catecholaminergic neurodegeneration, even in the absence of loss of neuronal cell body. • Great alternative for the fund-constrained neurobiology laboratories in developing countries to utilize this method in different cell types and their response to drugs/nutraceuticals.",

TRITC-labeled polyclonal secondary ab solution TRITC-labeled polyclonal secondary ab 5 μL 5% NGS blocking buffer 1,245 μL Take 1,245 μL of 5% NGS and add 5 μL of TRITC-labeled polyclonal\nsecondary ab (1:250 dilution). Mix it gently by inverting the tube slowly\nand store it on ice until used.\n\nProcedure Anti-TH immunostaining of the whole Drosophila brain Fix the fly whole head tissue in 1 mL of 4% PFA (pH 7.4) containing 0.5%\nTriton X-100 in a sterilized 1.5 mL centrifuge tube for 2 h through mixing\nby using a test tube rotator with constant velocity (10 rpm) at room\ntemperature (RT). Remove PFA after 2 h of fixation by washing the fly head tissue with 1 mL of\n0.1% PBST three times for 15 min each at RT. Carry out dissection of brains in 1× PBS (pH 7.4) under a stereo zoom\nmicroscope at RT using fine forceps and needles to remove the head capsule\nand connecting tissues. Then, wash the brains with 0.1% PBST five times for 15 min each at RT. Block the brains with 5% NGS blocking buffer solution for 120 min at RT. Then, incubate/probe brains with anti-TH polyclonal primary ab solution for\n72 h at 4 °C through mixing by using a test tube rotator at constant\nvelocity (10 rpm). Wash off excess primary antibodies by 0.1% PBST five times for 15 min each at\nRT. Incubate brains with TRITC-labeled polyclonal secondary ab solution for 24 h\nin the dark ( Critical: Cover centrifuge tube containing brains\nwith aluminum foil) by thorough mixing with a test tube rotator at a\nconstant velocity (10 rpm) at RT. To eliminate excess secondary antibodies, wash brains again with 0.1% PBST\nfive times for 15 min each at RT. Mount brains in VECTASHIELD ® mounting medium and then top\nwith cover glass. Critical: Glass spacers were placed around the VECTASHIELD ® mounting medium to protect brains from being crushed by a\ncoverslip. Critical: Brains were scanned in a dorsoventral orientation. Use clear fingernail polish to seal the edges. The sample is ready for image acquisition. Image acquisition Steps for the acquisition of Drosophila brain image(s) for\nquantification of DAergic neurons and FI using a fluorescence microscope with ZEN\n2012 SP2 software are as follows: Observe stained brains under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a\n40× objective lens ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Scanning of the whole brain of Drosophila . Scan the anti-TH immunostained Drosophila brain\nusing Carl Zeiss, Axio Imager M2 (40× objective lens) with\nZEN 2012 SP2 software that interactively controls image\nacquisition, image processing, and analysis of the images. Scan and take images using a monochromatic camera with a Rhodamine\nfluorescence filter ( Figure\n2 ). Figure 2. Image acquisition and performing the red dot test. For image acquisition, select a monochromatic camera with a\nRhodamine filter. Perform a red dot test for visibility of\ndopaminergic (DAergic) neurons and assessing saturation using a\nbrain, reusing the same exposure time for other samples. Perform a red dot test in the acquisition panel (select range indicator from Dimensions and set exposure from Acquisition parameter )\nfor visibility of DAergic neurons and to assess the signal saturation during\nthe image acquisition. Reuse the same exposure time for all brain samples ( Figure 2 ). Then, perform Z-stack programming with constant intervals of 1.08 μm for\neach image ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Selection of images and Z-Stacking To generate a 2D image, on the method column apply Ortho and Maximum\nintensity projection (MIP) from Ortho display with X–Y\nPlane ( Figure\n4 ). Figure 4. Creation of 2D image. For creating a 2D merged image, on the Method column, select Maximum intensity projection (MIP) with X-Y Plane. Export the 2D image of the brain in .jpg format for presentation ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5. Export of 2D brain image to the required format Method for quantification of DAergic neurons Identify clusters from the images/scans obtained through Z-stack programming\nwith constant intervals ( Figure 6 ). Enlarge the image to reveal the cell body/structure ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6. Quantification of dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal number and\nfluorescence intensity (FI). For the quantification of DAergic neuronal number and FI, select\n3D images/scans of Z-Stack with brain regions; PAL, PPL1, PPL2,\nPPM1/2, and PPM3 (PAL: Protocerebral anterior lateral; PPL:\nProtocerebral posterior lateral; PPM: Protocerebral posterior\nmedial). Determine/count the number of DAergic neurons in each cluster in an unbiased\nmanner. Method for characterization of FI of DAergic neurons From 3D scan images, chose the PAL, PPL1, PPL2, PPM1/2, PPM3, and VUM\n(quantifiable DAergic neuronal clusters) regions of the fly brains ( Figure 6 ). Enlarge brain images to see the clear neurites ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7. Details of the quantification of the fluorescence intensity\n(FI). Enlarge the images to see clear neurites, select appropriate\ntools, draw spline contour from graphics and\ndraw a line around the neuron, and display intensity mean value\nand area. Select the appropriate graphics tool, draw spline contour ,\nand draw a line to encircle the neuron giving intensity mean and area ( Figure 7 ). Select More measurement options and chose intensity\nsum by right-clicking inside the neuron ( Figure 8 ). From the Measurement tab on the left side of the panel,\nselect List, All views and Create document ( Figure 9 ). Record the area and FI sum for each image of a neuron in .xml format ( Figure 10 ). For quantification of FI of a single neuron, we considered a total of 11\nscans with an interval of 1.08 μm for each scan (cumulative of 11.88\nμm width) ( Figure 11 ). The intensity sum of all the neurons in a cluster gives the total FI of that\nparticular region (cluster-wise). Total FI is the sum of the FIs of all the neurons belonging to all the\nDAergic neuronal clusters. Precautions and recommendations Head tissue fixation is critical and should be properly done [use the test\ntube rotator with constant velocity (10 rpm) for fixing the head tissue\ngently and thoroughly]. If any issue arises with the working of antibodies\n(primary ab), the worker should first check if fixation was done thoroughly\nand properly before investing time in figuring out the efficiency of the\nantibody. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies should be done using a test\ntube rotator with constant velocity (10 rpm). Critical: To prevent brains from being crushed, glass spacers\nshould be used while mounting the brains with a coverslip. Coverslip edges should be thoroughly sealed with nail polish to avoid drying\nup of the brains. Image acquisition should be done on the same day to avoid bleaching. Care should be taken to capture images from the samples with the same\norientation. The red dot test should be carried out carefully. The same setting should be reused to capture the images/scans of different\nsamples. Care should be taken while performing Z-stack programming so that no neuron\nis left out of scanning. Figure 8. Measurement of fluorescence intensity (FI) sum. Select intensity sum by opting for more measurement\noptions (software provides the pixel value upon right-clicking on\nthe neuron). Figure 9. Fluorescence intensity (FI) compilation. From the measurement option select list, All views ,\nand create document . Figure 10. Measuring the FI sum for each scan of a neuron in .xml format Figure 11. Compilation of fluorescence intensity (FI) of a single neuron and all the\nneurons of a cluster. For the characterization of FI of a single neuron, a total of 11 scans with\nan interval of 1.08 μm for each scan (cumulative 11.88 μm width) were\nconsidered. Take the average and find the standard error. Follow the same\nmethod/step(s) for all the dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons. The intensity sum\nof all the neurons in a specific cluster gives the total FI of that\nparticular region (cluster-wise). The total FI is the sum of the FI of all\nthe neurons belonging to all the DAergic neuronal clusters.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research\narticle: Ayajuddin et al.

    "title": "Protocol of Whey Protein Isolate-Based Microgel Targeted Delivery in Mouse Kidney.",
    "abstract": "Every year, there is an increase in the number of cases of chronic kidney disease, and a delay in the initiation of adequate treatment can lead to kidney failure, which requires regular dialysis or transplantation. Intensive systemic therapy used to treat kidney diseases often has a negative impact on other weakened organs, making it crucial to ensure targeted delivery of medications directly to the kidneys and to minimize systemic side effects. In order to reduce the toxicity of medications and decrease dosages, innovative delivery methods are being developed, such as micro-sized targeted delivery systems, which ensure highly effective distribution of encapsulated drugs directly within the organs. In a recent article, we presented innovative emulsified microgels stabilized with whey protein isolate (WPI), specifically designed for targeted drug delivery to the kidneys. Our stability studies revealed that these microgels start to degrade after 72 h, with this degradation exhibiting a time-dependent profile. Furthermore, intravenous administration of the microgel suspension through the tail vein showed significant selective accumulation in both the liver and kidneys over a duration of 5 days. As part of our research, we present the protocol for synthesizing emulsion microgels derived from whey protein isolate. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the procedures for precursor preparation, along with an in-depth investigation of the emulsion system's stability over time. The protocol also includes the injection of an emulsion microgel suspension into the tail vein of mice, enabling the evaluation of their biocompatibility and potential therapeutic efficacy. This protocol outlines the precautions and important nuances that should be considered at each stage of the experiment. Key features • This protocol provides detailed instructions on the synthesis of fluorescently labeled emulsion microgels using mucoadhesive whey protein isolate, allowing the replication of this process. • The protocol describes in detail how to prepare samples for confocal microscopy. • We are exploring a method to study the stability of emulsion microgels by analyzing the size of emulsion droplets using optical microscopy. • We provide guidance on the administration of suspension into the tail vein of mice, followed by visualization of the microgels' body biodistribution.",

Linseed oil OLEOS (Russia) (unrefined cold pressed linseed oil, refractive index n20/D 1.4795, density 0.93 g/mL at 25 °C, commercial use) Note: It is possible to use linseed oil from another manufacturer. However, it is worth paying attention to its properties (the refractive index n20/D of 1.4795 and the density of 0.93 g/mL at 25 °C). 2.

Create a solution of 5% WPI in PBS (0.1 M, pH 8.3). Dissolve 1 g of WPI in 20 mL of PBS. 2. Prepare a 0.5 mL solution of Cy7 in DMSO (5 mg/mL) in a dark glass vial. 3. Combine the WPI and Cy7 solutions in a dark glass vial. Stir the resulting mixture at 900 rpm using an IKA magnetic stirrer for 24 h in the dark at 4 °C ( Figure 1 ). 4. Place the prepared WPI-Cy7 solution in a dialysis bag (pore size 14 kD). Submerge the dialysis bag containing the WPI-Cy7 solution in 2 L of deionized water and stir at 300 rpm for 48 h in the dark at 4 °C. 5. Determine the Cy7 dye concentration in the freshly prepared WPI-Cy7 solution by the spectrophotometric method. To do this, measure the optical density of the WPI-Cy7 solution at a 671 nm wavelength. The amount of Cy7 is determined on the basis of the optical density value at 671 nm using the corresponding calibration curve for Cy7. See our previous protocol for detailed instructions for obtaining calibration curves for a fluorescent dye (DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.5027, Section E, p. 4). 6. Store 20.5 mL of the freshly prepared Cy7-conjugated WPI in a refrigerator, away from light. Caution: Fluorescent dyes are light-sensitive, so any experiments involving proteins labeled with fluorescent markers must be conducted in dark containers or with aluminum foil covers. The Cy7 concentration should be optimized and controlled in experiments for consistent fluorescence intensity, particularly when different batches of fluorescent dye are used. Figure 1. Scheme of labeling whey protein isolate with Cyanine 7 NHS ester produced by Lumiprobe B. Formation of WPI-based emulsion microgels 1. Place 2 mL of 5% WPI-Cy7 solution in a 20 mL glass beaker. 2. Add 0.3 mL of linseed oil to the 2 mL of WPI-Cy7 solution. This corresponds to a ratio of WPI solution:oil (w:w) of 1:3. Caution: It is crucial to adhere to the precise proportions of the WPI and oil phases, as the size of the resulting microgels will be significantly influenced by this ratio. Note: For fluorescent visualization of emulsion microgels, Nile red was dissolved with linseed oil to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. a. Immerse the probe of the ultrasonic homogenizer into the resulting mixture of WPI solution and oil. Apply ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz and a power density of 1 W/cm 2 for 1 min to obtain the emulsion microgels ( Figure 2A ). b. Transfer the resulting emulsion microgels to 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 10,500× g for 5 min. c. Carefully collect the infusion fluid using a syringe. d. Then, wash emulsion microgels with saline solution twice according to sections D and E. e. Store the prepared emulsion microgels in 2 mL of saline solution in a refrigerator at 4 °C. Figure 2.

(D) Optical image of emulsion microgels. Scale bar, 50 μm. Note: The reproducibility of the results depends on the amount of encapsulated substances and the size of the resulting microgel. The loading capacity of the microgel can be determined by a spectrophotometric method by maximum absorption in accordance with the protocol [10.21769/BioProtoc.5027]. C. Confocal laser scanning microscopy 1. Dilute the initial emulsion microgel sample 1,000× with saline (0.15 M NaCl). Place the 5 μL diluted emulsion microgel on a glass slide and cover with a coverslip. 2. Observe the fluorescent properties of the prepared emulsion samples using a Leica TCS SP8 X inverted confocal microscope equipped with diode-pumped solid-state lasers (561 nm and 671 nm) focused through a 20×/0.70 N.A. objective ( Figure 2B ). 3. The Cy7 fluorescence is stimulated by a laser with a wavelength of 671 nm, and the resulting emission is measured in the range of 730–795 nm (green channel, Figure 2B ). 4. The Nile Red fluorescence is activated by a laser with a wavelength of 561 nm, and the resulting emission is measured in the range of 580–650 nm (red channel, Figure 2B ). 5. Use the LAS X Life Science Microscope Software for image processing. D. Optical microscopy and determination of emulsion microgel sizes 1. Measure the diameters of the emulsion microgels using the optical images of the samples. 2. For the sample preparation process for optical microscopy, follow a similar procedure to that of scanning laser microscopy, as described in section C1. Obtain optical images of emulsion microgels with the Olympus I × 73 inverted microscope and a 40× objective. 4. Measure the diameters of the emulsion microgel particles with the optical images obtained in the previous step using measurement tools of the ImageJ software. 5. For the calculation of the average diameter of the emulsion microgel, at least 100 measurements and 10 images for each sample are analyzed. Present the average diameter of particles as mean ± standard deviation. 6. In our case, the microgels were predominantly composed of particles with an average diameter of 2.2 ± 0.3 μm. E. Preparing mice for intravenous injection 1. Administer general anesthesia to a mouse by intraperitoneal injection using a mixture of Zoletil (40 mg/kg) and 2% Xylazine (10 mg/kg). We carried out this experiment with Balb/c mice (age 6–8 weeks, weight 20–25 g). Note: Alternatively, 2% Rometar can be used instead of Xylazine. 2. After 5–7 min, check for the reflex response of the hind limbs. If there is no hind limb reflex, proceed with manipulation. If the reflex is still present, wait a few more minutes before continuing. 3. Place the mouse on the desk and use a trimmer to shave off all the fur from its body, except for the head. 4. Apply a depilatory cream designed for sensitive skin. Carefully remove the cream using cotton pads soaked in saline or water. Note: Be sure not to leave the cream on the skin for more than 30–60 s to avoid any potential harm. F. Tail vein injection of emulsion microgel suspension and lifetime bio-visualization 1. To prepare the tail for injection, it is important to submerge it in water at 42 °C for approximately 20–30 s. After that, the tail should be dried with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture. Note: This will help dilate the blood vessels in the tail. Caution: Locate the tail vein by following the middle dorsal side of the tail. The left and right tail veins are located on either side of the artery. These veins are the targets for administration. However, pigmentation on the tail may obscure some blood vessels, so it is important to be careful when locating them. 2. After locating the vein, slowly insert the needle of the syringe (30 G) at a slight angle, about 5 cm from the tip of the tail (at an angle of 10–15°). 3. Slowly press down on the plunger of the syringe, injecting 50 μL of microgel suspended in saline solution at a concentration of 5 × 10 7 microgels. Inject at a constant rate of about 30 μL/s to prevent damage to the blood vessels. A graphical representation of the in vivo experiment is shown in Figure 3A and Video 1 . 4. Place the animal, positioned on a dark background, in the IVIS SpectrumCT imaging system, using an excitation/emission wavelength of 745/800 nm. Observe each mouse before and at specific times after the administration (10 min, 1 h, 5 h). 5. Analyze the results using the Living Image 4.7.3 software ( Figure 3B ). Figure 3.

    "title": "Preparation of Testicular Cells for Immunofluorescence Analysis of Manchette in Elongating Spermatids.",
    "abstract": "Immunofluorescence staining is a technique that permits the visualization of components of various cell preparations. Manchette, a transient structure that is only present in elongating spermatids, is involved in intra-manchette transport (IMT) for sperm flagella formation. Sperm flagella are assembled by intra-flagellar transport (IFT). Due to the big complexes formed by IMT and IFT components, it has been challenging to visualize these components in tissue sections. This is because the proteins that make up these complexes overlap with each other. Testicular tissue is digested by a combination of DNase I and Collagenase IV enzymes and fixed by paraformaldehyde and sucrose. After permeabilization with Triton X-100, testicular cells are incubated with specific antibodies to detect the components in the manchette and developing sperm tails. This method allows for cell type-specific resolution without interference from surrounding cells like Sertoli, Leydig, or peritubular myoid cells. Additionally, isolated cells produce cleaner immunofluorescence signals compared to other methods like tissue section/whole mount, making this method the best fit for visualizing protein localization in germ cells when spatial context is not being considered. Hence, this protocol provides the detailed methodology for isolating male mice germ cells for antibody-targeted immunofluorescence assay for confocal/fluorescence microscopy. Key features • The protocol includes a simple method for preparing single testicular cells for immunofluorescence analysis. • Visualization of components in the manchette and sperm flagella using specific antibody markers.",

Set up your dissection area in a clean and well-lit animal treatment room/workspace. 2. Put male mice in a suitable chamber/container for anesthetization using CO 2 as shown in Figure 1A . 3. Ensure the mouse is completely unconscious before taking it out of the container/chamber. This can be confirmed by tapping the mouse directly or shaking the container/chamber gently to monitor movement. Lack of movement is an indication of unconsciousness. Sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation. 4. Place mice with their abdominal side facing upward. Use scissors to make an incision to expose the lower abdomen. Pull out the testes and remove the fat and epididymis attached to them. Note: One testis is usually more than enough to get germ cells per experiment. 5. Put the testes in cold PBS to wash. Then, transfer to fresh cold PBS to remove the membrane (tunica albuginea) surrounding it, as shown in Figure 1D –G. 6. Cut testes into tiny pieces. Then, transfer into a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 5 mL of isolation buffer to digest. Figure 1. Stepwise isolation of mouse testis for germ cell retrieval. (A) Male mice anesthetization in an adequate chamber before cervical dislocation. (B) Abdominal incision to reveal the testes. (C) Isolated testis in cold PBS. (D–F) Removal of the tunica albuginea from the testis before digestion. (G–H) Testicular tissue cut up into pieces to disperse the seminiferous tubules before transfer into isolation buffer. B. Shaking incubation 1. Place the tube in a 32 °C water bath and shake gently (50 rpm) for 8 min. Use a transfer pipette to gently blow tissues off the bottom of the tube every 3 min. 2. Repeat step B1 three more times. Note: Total time: 4 × 8 min =32 min. By now, the tissues should be completely dissociated, as shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2. Representative image showing well-digested testicular tissues following 32 min of shaking incubation C. Centrifugation 1. While waiting, cool the Eppendorf TM 5810R to 4 °C. 2. After four repeats of shaking incubation, place the tube into the centrifuge and spin down at 200× g for 5 min at 4 °C. D. Discarding supernatant 1. Discard supernatant. 2. Add 5 mL of 1× PBS and gently suspend the cells with the transfer pipette. 3. Centrifuge at 200× g for 5 min at 4 °C. E. Fixation 1. Add 5 mL of fixation solution. 2. Gently suspend the cells with the transfer pipette and shake at room temperature for 15 min on a platform shaker (50 rpm). Note: PFA is toxic and should be handled according to standard safe use practices. Fixation waste should be collected in designated containers adequate for chemicals for hazardous waste cleanup in accordance with institutional environmental and health safety guidelines. F. Examination 1. Centrifuge the cells at 200× g for 5 min at 4 °C. 2. Discard the supernatant and wash three times with 1× PBS. 3. Resuspend the cells with PBS at 1 × 10 5 /mL (1–2 × 10 6 /mL, sperm cells). 4. Add 50 μL of cell suspension to 500 μL of fresh PBS. 5. Aliquot ~10 μL of cell suspension into a Petri dish and examine the cells under a microscope. Note: Ensure the cells are adequately diluted; they should be separated and individualized as in Figure 3A . Figure 3. Microscope view of cell suspension on a slide for density analysis. (A) Representative image showing an adequately diluted germ cell suspension for analysis. (B) Representative image of a slide with too much cell density for analysis. G. Preparation of slides 1. If density is appropriate, use a PAP pen to draw a square on a positively charged slide. 2. Plate 50 μL of the prepared cell suspension from F3 onto each square. 3. Gently smear to fill the entire square and leave horizontally. Note: A typical experiment should contain the experimental group, a negative control, and a positive control. The number of slides depends on the type and number of antibodies that are ready to be used. H. Air drying 1. Air dry the cell suspension for 45 min to 1 h. Note: Do not let the cell suspension dry completely, as shown in Figure 4 . This is to prevent nonspecific signals. Also, if the samples are too dry, binding of antibodies to the antigen will be impaired. 2. Insufficient drying before performing the next step might lead to cell loss. 3. Optimal dryness is achieved when the sample area is still wet, but there is no extra layer of liquid on the slide. Figure 4. Representative image of a cell suspension that is too dry on the slide I. Permeabilization 1. Place sliders in a wet box ( Figure 5 ). Permeabilize the cells with 50 μL of Triton X-100 (1%) at 37 °C for 5 min. Note: The wet box, also known as a humidity chamber, is a container or device designed to maintain a specific level of humidity within a confined space. Inside the box, there are mechanisms to control and regulate humidity. This can be achieved through the use of water-retaining substances, such as wet sponges or water-filled reservoirs, which release moisture into the air as it evaporates. The wet box is then placed in an incubator at 37 °C. Figure 5. Image of a wet box with slides in it. Put slides in the wet box during incubation to prevent the slides from drying out. J. Blocking 1. Wash the cells gently three times with 1× PBS. 2. Add 50 μL of blocking solution to each square and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 30 min in the wet box. K. Antibody incubation 1. Gently remove the blocking solution using a 100 μL pipette, add the indicated primary antibodies to the cells, and incubate overnight at 4 °C in a wet box. 2. Gently wash the cells three times with 1× PBS. 3. Incubate the indicated secondary antibodies in a wet box at room temperature for 1 h. 4. Gently wash the cells three times with 1× PBS for a total of 15 min. Gently use a Kimwipe to dry clean the surface of the slide. Notes: 1. Washing is very important and may need to be prolonged. Severe washing will make the cells fall off. Washing may be achieved by using a pipette to load PBS onto the slides at the edge of the square, followed by gentle aspiration from the edge to minimize cell loss during washing. 2. Keep in a wet box to prevent slides from drying, and then in a drawer to avoid light and drying. Fluorescent substances tend to experience a gradual decrease in fluorescence intensity when exposed to light, especially intense light. The fluorescent markers used in immunofluorescence experiments, such as FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate), undergo photochemical reactions under continuous excitation light, which leads to the destruction of their molecular structures and the subsequent loss of their fluorescent properties. If light is not avoided during the experiment, the premature quenching of the fluorescent markers will affect the observation and detection of fluorescent signals, reducing the sensitivity and accuracy of the experiment. L. Mounting 1. Add mounting media (VECTASHIELD® Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI). 2. Slowly cover with a coverslip and seal with nail polish. Notes: 1. Keep in the dark to avoid light. 2. DAPI is a benzimidazole derivative. It has a strong affinity for double-stranded DNA due to its ability to intercalate between the base pairs of DNA. It specifically binds to DNA, enabling clear visualization of the cell nucleus and other DNA-rich regions in cells. This high specificity makes it an excellent tool for distinguishing and analyzing the nuclear morphology and distribution of cells. 3. Ensure even distribution of DAPI and avoid introducing bubbles during coverage. This can be achieved by adding a drop of DAPI to the center of each sample square, then gently positioning the coverslip to the edge, and gradually tilting down to cover the slide. Then, press down gently for an even spread and the removal of excess DAPI to the side. Remove excess DAPI gently with wipes while ensuring the coverslip is not displaced. M.

    "title": "Fast and High-Resolution Imaging of Pollinated Stigmatic Cells by Tabletop Scanning Electron Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "In plants, the first interaction between the pollen grain and the epidermal cells of the stigma is crucial for successful reproduction. When the pollen is accepted, it germinates, producing a tube that transports the two sperm cells to the ovules for fertilization. Confocal microscopy has been used to characterize the behavior of stigmatic cells post-pollination [1], but it is time-consuming since it requires the development of a range of fluorescent marker lines. Here, we propose a quick, high-resolution imaging protocol using tabletop scanning electron microscopy. This technique does not require prior sample fixation or fluorescent marker lines. It effectively captures pollen grain behavior from early hydration (a few minutes after pollination) to pollen tube growth within the stigma (1 h after pollination) and is particularly efficient for tracking pollen tube paths. Key features • Analysis of the pollen behavior in stigmatic cells of Arabidopsis thaliana but can be broadly used for other species. • Rapid and high-resolution imaging method. • Allows testing pollen grain hydration states, pollen tube paths on stigmatic cells from various genetic backgrounds, and also pollen tube phenotypes.",
    "methods": "Materials and reagents Biological materials Arabidopsis thaliana , ecotype Columbia Col-0 plants with flowers at stages 12–15 [4] in individual pots Other materials Straight fine tweezers (Dumont, model: Inox 8) Double-sided black tape (Synergie4, model: DEN-77816) Wood sticks and soft plant ties to stack the plants Sewing thread to tag the emasculated pistils\n\nProcedure Plant preparation A few Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, accession Col0, were germinated in 0.25 L plastic pots containing a peat-based compost with 60 kg/m 3 of clay. After one week, we remove plantlets to keep one plant per pot to facilitate manipulation during emasculation and pollination. Plants are maintained in a growth chamber under long-day conditions (16 h light, 120–150 µmol m -2 ·s -1 /8 h dark at 21 °C/19 °C) with a relative humidity of around 60%. The plants are watered throughout their growth cycle. To prevent pest attacks, it is important to avoid overwatering, especially when the plants are young. Fertilizer (N/P/K: 18/10/18) is added to the watering water (4 mL/L) once a week. In our growth conditions, plants are ready for emasculation four weeks after germination; they have three or four robust stems. Avoid using old plants, which have more fragile stems and flowers and are more prone to dehydration during emasculation. Water the plant thoroughly the day before emasculation to ensure turgid stigmas and pollen. Flower emasculation should be done the day before pollination and imaging. Perform all processes at room temperature (around 22 °C). Stigma preparation (emasculation procedure, the day before) Flower emasculation should be done the day before pollination and imaging. See Video 1 . Position the plant in its culture pot under a stereomicroscope. Bend the plant's inflorescences and gently clamp a flower bud at the end of stage 12 ( Figure 1 , Smyth et al. [4]) between the thumb and the forefinger to prevent bud movement during emasculation. Video 1. Emasculation and pollination procedures Figure 1. Arabidopsis thaliana developmental stages, focused on the stigma and pollen maturity. Inspired from Smyth et al. [4]. Stage duration is specified. A sepal from a stage-12 flower bud was removed to better visualize internal organs. Using straight fine tweezers, remove flowers older than stage 12 [4] to minimize the risk of cross-pollination and younger buds to facilitate access to the stage-12 bud. Using fine tweezers, carefully open the flower bud to expose the stigma ( Figure 2A , B). Verify that anthers are not dehiscent, without any pollen grain released. Note: Emasculate in the morning when the anthers are less dehiscent, typically when the growth chamber lights are just starting, to minimize the risk of pollen contamination from other stigmas. Carefully remove the anthers (pale yellow, Figure 2C ), petals, and sepals. Note: Instead of completely removing organs, cut them with the fine tweezers (as indicated by arrows in Figure 2C ) to retain part of the tissues ( Figure 2D ) and prevent excess dehydration of the bare pistil. Ensure that no pollen grains remain on the stigma papillae ( Figure 2E ). Caution: If any pollen grains are present, discard the bud and select another stage-12 bud. Note: Limit emasculation to no more than five buds per plant to prevent pistil dehydration or damage to the emasculated buds while manipulating the plant. Figure 2. Arabidopsis thaliana stigma at the end of stage 12 and emasculation prior to pollination.

(E) Detailed close-up of the unpollinated stigma, free of pollen grains. Scale bars, 500 μm. (F) Staking of the plants using wood sticks and soft plant ties to support their stems. Post-emasculation care To label the emasculated pistil, a sewing thread can be attached at the base of the bare pistil. Stake the plants ( Figure 2F ). We use wood sticks and soft plant ties to support their stems (see Graphical overview, step 1). Caution: This step is important to prevent the bare pistils from getting in contact with pollen from other flower buds. Return the plants to the culture room. If imaging stage-13 stigmas, wait approximately 18 h after emasculation ( Figure 1 ; Smyth et al. [4]). Note: Ensure the plant is well-watered to maintain turgescence in the stigma and pollen. Pollination procedure (the day of imaging) Under a stereomicroscope, hand-pollinate each emasculated flower with mature wild-type pollen grains (e.g., flowers at stage 13, Figure 1 and 3A ). To do so, collect a single dehiscent anther from a non-emasculated flower bud with tweezers and carefully brush the stigma with it. For easier quantification of pollen tube paths, deposit only a small amount of pollen grains (as shown in Figure 3B , C). To achieve this, gently brush the dehiscent anther on a tissue to remove excess pollen grains before applying it to the stigma. Note: Collect a dehiscent anther from stage 13 to early stage 14 with pollen grains not too old to ensure the highest germination rate. Note on pollen germination: Temperature and humidity influence pollen germination. Therefore, prepare and store samples in a room at a moderate temperature (around 20 °C) and ensure it is not too dry (at least 50% humidity). This environment helps maintain optimal conditions for pollen germination. Figure 3. Pollination of Arabidopsis thaliana stigma at stage 13, stereomicroscope view. (A) Anther at maturity a few hours after dehiscence with yellow pollen grains. (B) Stigma shortly after pollination, displaying non-hydrated oval pollen grains (rugby balloon–like shape). (C) Stigma 30 min post-pollination, exhibiting well-hydrated roundish pollen grains (basket balloon–like shape). Scale bars, 100 μm. Post-pollination handling: Leave the pollinated plants at room temperature on the bench. Depending on the focus of the imaging: Wait 10–15 min to image pollen hydration. Wait 30–60 min to image long pollen tubes. Sample preparation Cut the pollinated pistils transversally in the middle of the ovary using fine tweezers at the designated time post-pollination (see Figure 4 ). Caution: Ensure that the sample height does not exceed 0.5 cm to fit into the microscope chamber. Figure 4. Preparation of the sample before deposition on the scanning electron microscopy platform. (A–B) Position of the transversal cut of the pistil in the middle of the ovary. Image setup procedure Sample mounting: Gently deposit two or three cut pistils vertically onto a 4 × 2 cm double-sided tape positioned on the SEM platform (see Figure 5 ). Ensure that the pistils are not too close to each other, maintaining a minimum distance of 1 cm between both. Figure 5. Scanning electron microscopy platform preparation. (A) Schematic view showing the method of mounting the stigmas on the SEM platform. (B) Platform displaying the cut pollinated pistils stuck on the double-sided tape before imaging. Scale bar, 1,000 μm. (C) Close-up view of two pistils mounted on the platform. Scale bar, 500 μm. Scanning electron microscopy setup: Place the platform in the Hirox SEM SH-3000 ( Figure 6 ), ensuring the door of the SEM is well sealed. Note: The same protocol can be used with other tabletop SEMs. Figure 6. Scanning electron microscopy Hirox SH-3000 Select temperature (-20 °C) and wait until that temperature is reached. Select accelerating voltage: 15 kV. Turn on the vacuum. Imaging procedure Observation: Observe samples within the first 15 min to prevent cells from collapsing during imaging. Caution: Fast action is crucial as cells can collapse quickly within 15 min (see Figure 7A ), making quantification of the pollen tube path impossible. For a quick initial screening, use the AutoFocus button. Tip: To obtain a sharp image of the stigma surface and adjust the focus, initially zoom in at high magnification on pollen grains located in the center of the stigma. Adjust the focus, contrast, and brightness. Then, zoom out to capture a broad view of the pistil. Image capture: Acquire the images ( Figure 7A –E). This method allows for imaging of the pollen hydration stage. Figure 7B displays non-hydrated pollen grains, while Figure 7C presents well-hydrated ones ( Figure 7C ). Pollen tube germination and tube paths can also be imaged and later quantified ( Figure 7D –E) (See Data analysis section). Figure 7. Visualization of pollinated stigmas at the scanning electron microscope. (A–C) Top view of a pollinated stigma observed at 300× magnification, showing (A) deflated stigmatic cells (collapsed), (B) fully turgid stigmatic cells with non-hydrated pollen grains (oval) a few minutes after pollination, and (C) stigmatic cells with well-hydrated pollen grains (round) and pollen tubes growing 30 min after pollination. (A–C) Scale bar, 50 μm. (D) Detail of (C) at 700× magnification. Scale bar, 50 μm. (E) Pollen–stigmatic cell interaction, viewed at 700× magnification. Scale bar, 20 μm. This method can be applied to compare the pollen tube paths on wild-type and mutated stigmatic cells. Additionally, it can be used reversely, comparing wild-type and mutated pollen grain hydration and pollen tube paths on wild-type stigmatic cells. To compare the behavior associated with a wild type and a mutant, ensure that the stigmatic cells are pollinated at the same development stage and that pollination is done simultaneously. Ideally, mount a wild type and a mutant on the same platform to ensure imaging is performed under identical conditions. Alternatively, single-stigma pollination can be conducted by applying two different pollen genotypes on each half of the stigma, as previously described [5].\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article(s): Riglet et al.

    "title": "Preparation of Polarity-Marked Microtubules Using a Plus-End Capping DARPin.",
    "abstract": "The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is formed in part by microtubules, which are relatively rigid filaments with inherent structural polarity. One consequence of this polarity is that the two ends of a microtubule have different properties with important consequences for their cellular roles. These differences are often challenging to probe within the crowded environment of the cell. Fluorescence microscopy-based in vitro assays with purified proteins and stabilized microtubules have been used to characterize polarity-dependent and end-specific behaviors. These assays require ways to visualize the polarity of the microtubules, which has previously been achieved either by the addition of fluorescently tagged motor proteins with known directionality or by fluorescently polarity marking the microtubules themselves. However, classical polarity-marking protocols require a particular chemically modified tubulin and generate microtubules with chemically different plus and minus segments. These chemical differences in the segments may affect the behavior of interacting proteins of interest in an undesirable manner. We present here a new protocol that uses a previously characterized, reversibly binding microtubule plus-end capping protein, a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin), to efficiently produce polarity-marked microtubules with different fluorescently labeled, but otherwise biochemically identical, plus- and minus-end segments. Key features • Produces polarity-marked microtubules with biochemically identical segments • Allows analysis of end-specific and polarity-dependent activities of purified microtubule-associated proteins • Requires purified microtubule plus-end capping DARPin (D1)2 • Concentrations optimized for porcine brain tubulin.",

On ice, prepare a mixture of 3 μM total tubulin in BRB80 1×, supplemented with 0.5 mM GMPCPP, including fluorescent tubulin at a final labeling ratio of 3%–5% and (optionally) 18% biotinylated tubulin, with a total volume of 200 μL in a microcentrifuge tube. Incubate mixture on ice for 5 min. Transfer the tube to 37 °C and incubate for 1 h. Warm 3 mL of BRB80 1× to 37 °C for subsequent steps. After incubation, dilute seeds with 170 μL of warm BRB80 1× and centrifuge at 17,000× g for 10 min at room temperature in the tabletop microcentrifuge. Remove the supernatant. Note: You should be able to see a pellet with color depending on the fluorescent dye used. Wash the pellet by adding 400 μL of warm BRB80 1× and centrifuging again at 17,000× g for 10 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 μL of warm BRB80 1×. Keep microtubules at room temperature. Bright GMPCPP-stabilized minus-end extensions using DARPin (D1) 2 Thaw an aliquot of DARPin (D1) 2 and dilute to 2.5 μM in BRB80 1× on ice. From freshly thawed aliquots of unlabeled tubulin, fluorescent tubulin, and (optionally) biotinylated tubulin, prepare a new “bright” mixture of 3 μM total tubulin in BRB80 1×, supplemented with 0.5 mM GMPCPP, including fluorescent tubulin at a final labeling ratio of 10%–15% and (optionally) 18% biotinylated tubulin, with a total volume of 200 μL in a microcentrifuge tube. Incubate the “bright” mixture on ice for 5 min. During the incubation, add 2 μL of the DARPin (D1) 2 dilution to 8 μL of the previously prepared dimly-labeled microtubules at room temperature. The protein will bind the microtubule plus-ends, ensuring that the subsequent bright extensions are exclusively from the microtubule minus-ends. Dilute the “bright” mixture with 200 μL of cold BRB80 1×. Transfer 90 μL of the diluted “bright” mixture to 37 °C and incubate for 1 min. Add the 10 μL DARPin (D1) 2 /dim seed mixture directly to the warmed “bright” mixture [resulting in final concentrations of 50 nM DARPin (D1) 2 , 1.35 μM tubulin, and 0.23 mM GMPCPP]. Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 1 h. Brightly labeled, stabilized extensions will grow from microtubule minus-ends, as the plus-ends are capped, resulting in microtubules with two distinctly labeled segments. After incubation, dilute seeds with 170 μL of warm BRB80 1× and centrifuge at 17,000× g for 10 min at room temperature in the tabletop microcentrifuge. Remove the supernatant, including unpolymerized tubulin, GMPCPP, and the capping protein, DARPin (D1) 2 . Note: There are fewer seeds at this point, so the pellet may be challenging to see. Wash the pellet by adding 400 μL of warm BRB80 1× and centrifuging again at 17,000× g for 10 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 μL of warm BRB80 1×. Keep microtubules at room temperature. Polarity-marked microtubules should be used within the day. Quick check: properly segmented microtubules Using a fluorescent microscope, the success of the protocol can be checked by quickly preparing a 1:6 μL dilution of the microtubules and “squashing” the dilution between a coverslip and slide. Fluorescence imaging will readily show how many of the dim stabilized microtubules have a single bright extension. (Figure 1). Figure 1. AlexaFluor647-labeled, polarity-marked microtubules on a glass slide. Imaged with a 60 × objective on a spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscope. Gliding assay to determine correct polarity labeling We use a simple gliding assay adapted from previous work to determine the polarity of our labeled microtubules. Place two strips of the double-sided tape on a standard microscopy slide (the counter glass) about 5 mm apart. Press the tape down forcefully with forceps or the end of a microcentrifuge tube. Leave the protective backing. Leave for at least 15 min at room temperature to allow the tape to fully adhere. Pipette 10 μL of 2 mg/mL PLL-PEG between the two strips of tape and spread to all the edges using a pipette tip. Allow PLL-PEG solution to dry. Rinse thoroughly with MilliQ water and dry using pressurized air. Using a diamond scribe pen, cut a #1.5 22 × 22 mm coverslip into four equal squares. Any debris from the cutting can be removed with pressurized air. Remove the protective tape backing and place one of the coverslip pieces on top, pressing down firmly over the tape to ensure proper adhesion. Use 50 μL of gliding buffer to wash the chamber, using filter paper to pull the solution through, and incubate with gliding buffer for 3 min at room temperature. Dilute the motor protein, e.g., the minus-end-directed kinesin-14 HSET, to 100 nM in gliding buffer, and wash 50 μL through the chamber, followed by 3 min incubation with the motor dilution at room temperature. Dilute the polarity-marked seeds 1:6 with room temperature gliding buffer and flow 50 μL into the chamber, again pulling through with the filter paper. Seal the chamber ends with Koralison TM paste. Image fluorescent microtubules at the microscope, using a 5 s interval between frames to capture gliding events over the course of 20 min (Figure 2, Video. 1). Seeds should glide directionally according to the motor, e.g., the minus-end-directed HSET will drive microtubules with the plus/dim end leading. We found that 100% of motile microtubules with one dim and one bright segment glided in the appropriate direction. It can be difficult to achieve such a high percentage of correctly labeled polarity-marked microtubules using the NEM-tubulin method, which typically requires defining an acceptable threshold for successful labeling that is sufficiently high for the specific downstream assay. Figure 2. AlexaFluor647-labeled, polarity-marked microtubules gliding on glass-adsorbed HSET motor proteins. As a minus-end-directed motor, HSET will drive microtubules according to their polarity with their plus-ends leading, indicating that the bright and dim segments are the minus- and plus-ends of the microtubule, respectively. Imaged with a 60 × objective on a spinning disk confocal microscope. Arrows indicate the position of the bright end in the first frame. See also Video 1 . Video 1. Polarity-marked microtubules gliding on glass-adsorbed minus-end-directed HSET motor proteins. Microtubules attach to the surface over time and glide in the direction of their dim segments, i.e., with their plus-ends leading.

    "title": "A Simple Staining Method Using Pyronin Y for Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy to Evaluate Gelatin Cryogels.",
    "abstract": "This study explores the novel application of pyronin Y for fluorescently labeling extracellular matrices (ECMs) and gelatin cryogels, providing a simple and reliable method for laser scanning confocal microscopy. Pyronin Y exhibited remarkable staining ability of the porous structures of gelatin cryogels, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for evaluating such biomaterials. Confocal imaging of pyronin Y-stained cryogels produced high signal-to-noise ratio images suitable for quantifying pores using Fiji/Image J. Importantly, pyronin Y enabled effective dual-color imaging of cryogel-labeled mesenchymal stem cells, expanding its utility beyond traditional RNA assays. Traditional staining methods like Mason's trichrome and Sirius Red have limitations in cryogel applications. Pyronin Y emerges as a powerful alternative due to its water solubility, minimal toxicity, and stability. Our results demonstrate pyronin Y's ability to specifically stain gelatin cryogel's porous structures, surpassing its weak staining of ECMs in 2D. Confocal imaging revealed enduring staining even under rigorous scanning, with no notable photobleaching observed. Furthermore, pyronin Y's combination with Alexa Fluor 647 for dual-color imaging showed promising results, validating its versatility in fluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, this study establishes pyronin Y as a cost-effective and rapid option for fluorescent staining of gelatin cryogels. Its simplicity, efficacy, and compatibility with confocal microscopy make it a valuable tool for characterizing and evaluating gelatin-based biomaterials, contributing significantly to the field of cryogel imaging. The study opens new avenues for dual-color imaging in biomaterial research and tissue engineering, advancing our understanding of cellular interactions within scaffolds. Key features • Fluorescent staining of gelatin-based cryogels with an inexpensive yet less time-consuming protocol. • Pyronin Y staining is suitable for dual-color confocal imaging by combining with far-red fluorophores (such as Alexa Fluor 647). • The method is conducted routinely.

Make sure to measure the volume of liquid that your casting can hold (depending on this volume, you may scale up/down the total volume of the cryogel) (Recipe 1). Mix water, gelatin, and glutaraldehyde in an appropriate tube, such as a 15 mL plastic tube. Critical: Add glutaraldehyde solution after gently mixing water and gelatin, because chemical crosslinking will start soon after adding glutaraldehyde. After the addition of glutaraldehyde, gently mix the solution again. Pour the mixed solution into an apparatus. Leave on the bench (room temperature) for 30 min. Carefully place an apparatus in a -20 °C freezer. Leave in a freezer overnight (~16 h). Critical: Freeze-thawing is the critical step for the formation of porous structure. Make sure that other people do not open the freezer door (especially during the initial freezing process). Taking out cryogels Take out a gel apparatus from the -20 °C freezer and leave it on a bench until completely thawed. Critical: If a cryogel is not completely thawed, gels or pore structures may be damaged during the process of retrieving a cryogel from an apparatus. See General note 1. Set up a dish (such as a 100 mm Petri dish or a rectangular plastic dish) filled with 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (Recipe 2). Carefully separate glass plates or slowly push the gel (if a glass tube or a syringe is used). Rinse cryogels with deionized water. Then, transfer cryogels to a dish filled with 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer. Add a small pinch of sodium borohydride powder to the solution. One previous study indicates 0.1 M freshly prepared sodium borohydride solution [4]. This is equivalent to the concentration of 3.78 mg/mL. You will start seeing bubbles (sodium borohydride reacts with remaining glutaraldehyde and producing hydrogen). To quench enough, you may leave cryogels in the sodium borohydride solution overnight on a rocking shaker ( Pause point ). Cryogels can be kept in sodium carbonate buffer with or without sodium borohydride. However, we recommend starting the quenching with sodium borohydride soon after taking out gels from the casting apparatus, as it will take at least overnight to quench residual sodium borohydride well. Remaining sodium borohydride can cause cell death if you grow cells. You can keep cryogels in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer. Keep it in a refrigerator ( Pause point ). Rinse well with deionized water before use. Staining of cryogels Cutting cryogels Use a razor blade to slice a piece of cryogel. Make a small rectangular piece (approximately 5–10 mm is sufficient) Transfer a piece of cryogel onto the glass surface of a glass-bottom dish. (Not necessary: We conducted this to compare pyronin Y staining in 2D and 3D) To stain ECM coating, the surface of a glass bottom dish should be coated with 1 mg/mL of ECM solution first. Then, the same staining process (step B2) needs to be done. Pyronin Y staining Critical: If MSCs are included, go to section E, then come back here after Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin staining of MSCs. Place a piece of cryogel from the previous step onto a glass bottom dish (#1.5 thickness). Critical: The thickness of coverslips is critical to acquiring microscopic images with the optimum conditions. Add the pyronin Y solution (Recipe 3) to cover the entire gel. Although the volume will depend on the size of a piece of cryogel, typically 50–200 μL of the pyronin Y solution is sufficient. Leave at room temperature for 5 min. Rinse the stained cryogel with deionized water three times (5 min each). If over-staining happens, try again with a shorter staining time (see step C1h and General note 5). Imaging of cryogels with a laser-scanning confocal microscope* *Many people may use their core imaging facility. It may be easy for you to consult with your facility manager/director. Critical: Please let them know that the settings described in steps C1c–d are critical, as pyronin Y’s imaging probably requires less laser power and relatively low digital gain; see General note 2. Determine the acquisition settings Place a 35 mm glass-bottom dish with a piece of the stained cryogel onto the stage of a confocal microscope. Use an appropriate objective lens (see General note 2). Set the lowest laser power that is necessary to obtain sufficient signals. With a Zeiss 880 equipped with a highly sensitive Gallium-Arsenide-Phosphide (GaAsP) detector, ~0.1% was sufficient for the excitation of pyronin Y (with a 561 nm laser). When MSCs (stained with Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin) are also included for dual-color imaging, a slightly higher laser power for a 633 nm laser may be needed (see General note 3). Select the laser for pyronin Y excitation (such as 561 nm). Set the scanning area, digital zoom, and scanning speed (important; see General note 4). We used the highest scanning speed (8; resulting in a resolution of 0.415 μm). The scanning area is up to your choice. Because the magnification is low in this case (20×), we set 1,024 × 1,024. 512 × 512 may be too small. Set the master gain. Probably ~500 is appropriate. ( Critical: Too high master gain can damage the detector.) Because pyronin Y staining of gelatin cryogels gives fairly high signals, we strongly suggest keeping the digital gain at 1.0 and digital offset at 0. Set the pinhole diameter. In Zeiss confocal operated with Zen, you simply need to hit 1 AU , which will set the optimum pinhole diameter (with a 561 nm excitation wavelength, it is 36 μm). Hit Live to check that the setting is suitable for imaging. Keep your eye on the histogram of the signal to make sure that the signal is not saturated (see General note 5). If you conduct dual-color imaging with MSCs stained with Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin, repeat steps C1f–h with the laser for the excitation of Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin. [In our case, we used a 633 nm laser; an excitation wavelength closer to 647 nm is fine (better) if available.] Also, carefully check what MSCs look like (see Troubleshooting). Acquire images In the control panel, first set live to determine the start and the end plane. When you set the z-axis step, a 1.0 μm interval may be sufficient, because a relatively low magnification of an objective lens is used. Then, hit the start experiment button. The following YouTube video may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhFb6vU1Iyg . Save z-stack images. Keep the original data files without modification ( important ). Quantification of pores using Image J/Fiji [13] Export files from the original z-stack data files Open the original data files with the software to control the microscope and export them to create TIFF files (see General note 6). If Zeiss confocal is used, the original files can be opened with Fiji. Adjust the contrast if necessary (see General note 7). Quantification of pores (see General note 8) Copy the selected z-plane image from the stack ( Image → Duplicate ). When a small window pops up, type the desired single-plane range (for example, 8-8). Set the threshold ( Image → Adjust → Threshold ). The following YouTube video may be very useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gm9Q_TdRvY . MSC culture Rinsing cryogels Rinse a piece of cryogel with deionized water extensively. After rinsing, dip a piece of gel in 70% ethanol, then place it on a 35 mm dish (or a 12-well plate for more convenient handling). Then, place a dish/plate in a UV crosslinker for approximately 2 min. If a UV crosslinker is not available, placing it under a cell culture hood for approximately 5–10 min (then turning on the UV lamp) can be an alternative. Caution: Do not overdo this process, especially with a UV crosslinker. It can dry the gel too much and cause shrinking. Also, cryogels should be handled aseptically after this process. Contamination of microorganisms has to be avoided. We used a UV crosslinker only to sterilize cryogels. Chemical crosslinking is not the purpose of this procedure; therefore, sterilization under cell culture hoods with UV lamps will also work fine. MSC culture and staining Slowly seed 10 μL of trypsinized MSCs suspension (~400,000 cells/mL) onto a piece of cryogel in a 12-well tissue culture plate to absorb the cell suspension. Put the plate back in a CO 2 incubator and leave it for 30 min to allow MSCs to adhere to a cryogel piece. Caution: If your gel is too dry, you may want to add a little drop of cell culture medium after the previous step to avoid cells dying due to drying. Add 1 mL of culture medium. Aspirate the medium a few hours later and fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Permeabilize the cell membrane with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (5 min). Rinse with PBS three times (5 min each). Stain F-actin with Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin (1/100) in PBS for 15–30 min (see General note 9). Rinse with PBS three times (5 min each). Conduct the Pyronin Y staining (as described in B2; also see General note 10).\n\nValidation of protocol In order to test the specificity of pyronin Y dye to different ECMs, pyronin Y was first applied to stain the various ECMs in 2D. Glass-bottom dishes were coated with each ECM protein and then incubated with pyronin Y solution. The comparison of the average maximum fluorescence intensity showed minimal staining of the ECMs coating of the glass surface (Figure S1). The fluorescence intensity, however, yielded a slightly higher signal level in gelatin- and collagen-coated dishes. This result implied that pyronin Y may potentially recognize a specific structure present in those proteins, such as glycine-proline-hydroxyproline triplets. Remarkably, gelatin cryogels showed approximately 8-fold higher average signals than gelatin or collagen coating (Figure S1). Indeed, pyronin Y staining of a gelatin cryogel resulted in exceptionally clear visualization of porous structures ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Examination of pyronin Y staining in three channels. No staining (top) and pyronin Y staining (bottom) of cryogels imaged with three different laser lines (488, 561, and 633 nm). Scale bar = 50 μm. Through threshold adjustment, followed by conversion to a black-and-white format and inversion of the binary image, the production of a clear image of the mesh-like pores ( Figure 2A ) was possible. Using the object counting function in Fiji software allowed the semi-automatic outlining and quantification of pore sizes (section C). Employing a 561 nm laser resulted in more than 50% of the peak emission of pyronin Y, which has an optimum excitation peak of around 544 nm (Figure S2). In contrast, a 488 nm laser, though less efficient, still presented approximately 15% of the maximum emission. Consequently, some degree of bleed-through was expected by combining pyronin Y with green fluorescent dyes for dual-color imaging. However, at 633 nm, pyronin Y is not expected to emit any fluorescence. This theoretical bleed-through was experimentally validated by imaging a pyronin Y-stained gelatin cryogel with three laser lines (488, 561, and 633 nm). As presented in Figure 1 , excitation of a pyronin Y–stained cryogel with a 488 nm laser yielded a low, yet recognizable level of bleed-through, whereas excitation with a 633 nm laser showed no detectable emission. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining pyronin Y with a far-red fluorescence dye, such as Alexa Fluor 647, may be more effective for dual-color imaging. Based on these insights, we conducted dual-color imaging of MSCs and a piece of cryogel. Figure 2B demonstrates that the combination of pyronin Y and Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin staining enabled successful dual-color confocal imaging of cryogels and MSCs. Although there was a subtle staining inside of MSCs observed in the red channel ( Figure 2B ), it was believed to be due to the binding of pyronin Y to RNA inside of MSCs. The far-red channel clearly shows distinct actin staining (center, Figure 2B ). This compelling evidence reinforces the versatility of pyronin Y as a powerful tool in fluorescence microscopy, particularly for dual-color imaging applications. The successful combination of pyronin Y with Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin in our experiments not only validates our hypothesis but also sets a new precedent for advanced imaging techniques in cellular and molecular biology.

    "title": "GPSeq maps the radial organization of eukaryotic genomes along the nuclear periphery-center axis.",
    "abstract": "Genomic loci positioning by sequencing (GPSeq) is a genome-wide method for mapping the radial organization of the genome in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. GPSeq relies on in situ digestion of chromatin with a restriction enzyme that gradually diffuses inward from the nuclear periphery, followed by ligation of sequencing adapters to the digested restriction enzyme sites and library preparation for high-throughput sequencing. In parallel, ligation of labeled imaging adapters to the digested restriction enzyme recognition sites enables monitoring of the progression of radial digestion by fluorescence microscopy, providing an essential internal quality control before proceeding with sequencing. By comparing samples in which chromatin has been digested for increasing time intervals, a GPSeq score is calculated for every genomic bin into which the genome is arbitrarily divided, and genome-wide radial maps are generated with a resolution as high as 25 kb. These maps allow exploration of the radial distribution of (epi)genomic features, gene expression levels, mutational landscapes, and genomic profiles of DNA damage, when integrated with other omic data. Here, we present a detailed step-by-step protocol for performing GPSeq and preprocessing GPSeq data. The entire protocol requires ~2 weeks from the start of sample preparation to having ready-to-sequence libraries and intermediate levels of expertise in molecular biology, genomics and microscopy.",
    "methods": "Methods Generation of replication timing data Protocols for generating and quality control for replication timing data from microarray hybridization (Repli-chip) or sequencing (Repli-seq) were performed as previously described 2 , 3 , 31 . CH12, MEL, Gm12878, Gm12801, Gm12812, Gm12813, HeLa-S3, HepG2, HUVEC, IMR90, MCF-7, Sk-N-Sh and NHEK cells were obtained and grown according to standard ENCODE cell culture protocols 32 . Wild-type control and Suz12 knockout naive mESCs were derived from the previously described strain 25 and obtained from Anne Laugesen and Kristian Helin and cultured in 2i+LIF medium as previously described 33 . Previously published Repli-chip 2 , 4 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 and Repli-seq 3 data sets were also used in this study ( Extended Data Table 1 ). Analysis of aligned TTRs Regions surrounding each of the 8,433 TTRs called in all mESC data sets 6 were aligned by assigning a fixed number of evenly spaced windows from 100 kb downstream of the early boundary to 100 kb upstream of the late boundary. The number of windows depended on the type of data being analysed but was suited for 400 kb, in effect treating each TTR as if it were 600 kb (mean TTR length). Averaged mESC replication-timing profiles 6 and lamina-association data 9 were collected in 10-kb windows and DI data 8 were collected in 40-kb windows surrounding called TTRs. Smoothed intervals containing 95% of the replication-timing data were plotted using custom R scripts. Analysis of aligned TADs and LADs Averaged mESC replication-timing profiles 6 were aligned across TADs and LADs by assigning data into a fixed number of evenly spaced windows across their length, respectively suited for their median lengths of 800 kb (80 windows) and 450 kb (45 windows). Similarly, Tig3 lamina association data 40 were assigned to evenly spaced windows across IMR90 TADs. IMR90 TADs were subdivided into 3 classes (that is, ‘early’, ‘TTR’, ‘late’) depending on both the means and standard deviations of IMR90 replication timing within each TAD. Early TADs had mean replication timing > 0.9 and standard deviation < 0.25, late TADs had mean replication timing < −0.4 and standard deviation < 0.25, and all others TADs were considered TTR. Replication domain boundary identification and analysis Repli-chip data were quantile normalized to the average distribution of data sets generated by the same microarray platform. Repli-seq weighted average data for 1-kb windows were centred about zero and initially normalized to an interquartile range of 1.59, which is equivalent to standard Repli-chip early/late CGH timing values (log 2 Cy3/Cy5 enrichment) for individual probes. Repli-seq data sets were then quantile normalized to a combined pool of all Repli-seq points by random sampling. Loess smoothed replication-timing profiles were obtained from each quantile-normalized data set using a smoothing span of 35, 85, 115, and 345 data points for mouse 385k probe Repli-chip, mouse 720k probe Repli-chip, human 720k probe Repli-chip, and human 2M probe Repli-chip data sets respectively or 287–394 data points for human Repli-seq data sets. Replication domain boundaries were identified as the early border of transitions between relatively earlier and later replicating regions in individual data sets with a slope above ± 2.75 × 10 −6 RT units per bp at the early border and with a sustained slope above ± 1× 10 −6 RT units per bp for 200 kb–1 Mb and at least 0.55 RT units and 30, 60, 6, 44 and 165 data points for mouse 385k probe Repli-chip, mouse 720k probe Repli-chip, human 720k probe Repli-chip, human 2M probe Repli-chip data sets, respectively, or 140–192 data points for human Repli-seq data sets. Initial boundary calls were filtered further by removing boundaries within 125 kb of gaps between adjacent data points spanning at least 80, 54.5, 77.5, and 80 kb for mouse 385k probe Repli-chip, mouse 720k probe Repli-chip, human 720k probe Repli-chip, and human 2M probe Repli-chip data sets respectively or 60–100 kb for human Repli-seq data sets. For each cell type, a combined list of boundaries was generated and the positions of similarly oriented boundaries within 105 or 160 kb from each other were averaged for mouse or human, respectively. For each species (mouse and human), the combined lists of boundaries for each cell type was combined and the positions of similarly oriented boundaries within 200 kb from each other were averaged. Finally, a set of unique replication domain boundaries was obtained by averaging any remaining boundaries within 140 or 160 kb for mouse or human, respectively. Regions surrounding replication domain boundaries were aligned for each feature (for example, TAD boundaries) by combining into a single vector the relative positions of each occurrence of the feature within 2 Mb of the replication domain boundary. Probability density functions were estimated across each vector of relative positions using the density function in the stats R package with a Gaussian kernel and bandwidth adjusted according to Silverman’s rule of thumb 41 . Replication-timing data across the same regions were averaged in 2kb windows. Lists of TAD domain and boundary coordinates 8 , lamina-association data and LAD domain coordinates 9 , 40 , Origin G-rich repeated elements (OGREs) 42 , N-domain boundaries 28 , replication origins and G-quadruplex (G4) motifs with loop sizes from 1 to 15 bases (L1–15) 43 , housekeeping and tissue-specific gene promoters 8 , and SUZ12 (ref. 44 ) and CTR9 (ref. 45 ) ChIP-seq data were published previously. Lists of repetitive DNA element coordinates were downloaded from ( http://repeatmasker.org ) 46 . TFBS, DHS, and histone mark ENCODE data were downloaded from UCSC 23 , 32 . If needed, data position coordinates were converted to mm9 or hg19 genome builds using UCSC LiftOver with default settings. TAD boundary identification New annotation of IMR90 TADs was performed by calculating an interaction directionality index for IMR90 Hi-C data 47 . Briefly, the genome was divided into 40-kb windows and for each window the frequency of interaction within 2 Mb upstream of the window to the frequency of interaction within 2 Mb downstream of the window was compared as described previously 8 . A second directionality index was also calculated for the same data set using a window size of 20 kb and only considering interactions within 1 Mb for each window. Chromatin state analysis ChromHMM 48 was applied on pooled ChIP-seq mapped reads from replicates for each of four histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K36me3, and H3K27me3) in 15 mouse cell lines (G1E, G1E-ER4+E2, erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, CH12, Mel, ESbruce4, thymus, kidney, small intestine, E14 whole brain, liver, spleen, heart, and Testis) and 3 human cell lines (Gm12878, H1 hESC, and K562) to learn a multivariate HMM model for genome segmentation. Mapped reads were first processed into binarized data in 200-bp windows over the mapped genome, with ChIP input reads as the background control. To learn the model jointly from mouse and human, a pseudo genome table was first constructed by concatenating mouse (mm9) and human (hg19) tables. A model was then learned from all binarized data, giving a set of emission parameters and transition parameters, which was used to produce segmentations based on the most likely state assignment of the model. The eight-state model used in this paper appeared most parsimonious in the sense that all eight states had clearly distinct emission properties, while the interpretability of distinction between states in models with additional states was less clear. TAD boundary orientation and analysis For each analysed feature, data surrounding TAD boundaries were aligned in 10-kb windows from 500 kb upstream to 500 kb downstream of each TAD boundary. The considered regions were then inverted if the average feature density downstream of the TAD boundary was greater than the average feature density upstream of the TAD boundary, so that feature density decreased from left to right across each boundary. After orienting TAD boundaries in this manner, each window was averaged for all TAD boundaries. Local boundary enrichment was then evaluated by comparing the average density of windows within 20 kb of the TAD boundary to the average density of windows 140–430 kb away from the TAD boundary on the side with increased density. Transcription factor combination model Raw data from genome-wide ChIP-seq in vivo detection of transcription factor binding 49 were processed in 200 bp bins over a 1 Mb window around the centre of each mESC TAD. Each sample can be thought as a 2-dimensional matrix with rows for seven transcription factor activity profiles and each row represented as a real vector with values for each bin in the 1 Mb window (number of bins = 5,000). The value X ijk represented the activity (that is, peak enrichment) of transcription factor j , k bins from the centre of TAD i . The model consists of a stack of 6 sigmoid denoising autoencoders, which define parameterized feature extraction (encoder) and reconstruction functions (decoder). The encoder projects the data into a smaller dimension feature space and the decoder reconstructs the input from the feature space. The parameters of the functions are optimized to give the smallest reconstruction error over all the training data samples. Although similar in principle to PCA (they both can be used as dimensionality reduction techniques), the denoising auto-encoder learns a nonlinear mapping between the input and its representation. Furthermore, constraints on the input and feature dimension sizes and the addition of noise to the input force it to learn important structure in the input. The stack reduces input dimensions gradually from (7 × 5,000), (7 × 10,00), (7 × 200), (7 × 60), (7 × 30), (7 × 20), to (7 × 10). Each autoencoder injects an additive binomial noise with a 20% corruption rate. We initialized weights at small random values with mean zero and used minibatch stochastic gradient descent 50 to minimize the mean squared input reconstruction error. We trained on 200 random samples for 500 epochs each layer then used the model to transform all other samples. Model output was evaluated using gold standard labels based on both the means and standard deviations of mESC replication timing within each TAD. Early TADs had mean replication timing > 0 and standard deviation < 0.25, late TADs had mean replication timing < 0 and standard deviation < 0.25, and all others TADs were considered TTR. The programs we wrote to perform the analysis are based heavily on scikitlearn, dimer and their dependencies. To build data sets and train denoising auto-encoders we used dimer Version 0.1 ( https://bitbucket.org/gertidenas/dimer/commits/tag/TADS ). To perform PCA, cluster the data, and evaluate models, we used scikitlearn Version 0.14-git ( http://scikit-learn.org/ ).\n\nSupplementary information Supplementary Information This file contains a Supplementary Discussion and additional references.

    "title": "An Optimized Protocol for High-Quality AFM Imaging of Amyloid Fibrils.",
    "abstract": "Characterizing the morphology of amyloid proteins is an integral part of studying neurodegenerative diseases. Such morphological characterization can be performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution images of the amyloid protein fibrils. AFM is widely employed for visualizing mechanical and physical properties of amyloid fibrils, not only from a biological and medical perspective but also in relation to their nanotechnological applications. A crucial step in AFM imaging is coating the protein of interest onto a substrate such as mica. However, existing protocols for this process vary considerably. The conventional sample preparation method often introduces artifacts, particularly due to deposition of excess salt. Hence, an optimized protocol is essential to minimize salt aggregation on the mica surface. Here, we present an optimized protocol for coating amyloid proteins onto mica using the dip-washing method to eliminate background noise. This approach improves the adherence of protein to the mica surface while effectively removing residual salts. Key features • The protocol introduces a new method to coat protein samples onto mica sheets for AFM imaging. • It presents a dip-washing technique aimed at removing excess salt deposited on the mica sheet, thereby minimizing imaging artifacts. • This protocol can be used for analyzing amyloid fibrillation mechanisms as well as capturing time-dependent fibrillation dynamics under various physiological conditions. • It also provides clear stepwise washing instructions that balance the salt removal and retention of protein fibrils on the mica.",

Preparation of amyloid protein/peptide Note: Before proceeding to the AFM sample preparation and imaging protocol, the following steps describe our procedure established for Saccharomyces cerevisiae Stm1 protein and validated for human Aβ42 peptide. The steps described in section A are not absolutely required to proceed. Readers can obtain their amyloid protein sample using the protocol of their choice. 1. To sub-clone the stm1 gene (YLR150W) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288c) into the pET-21A vector, an ampicillin-resistant pBG1805 cloning vector that contains the stm1 gene was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific Inc. and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Subsequently, the amplified PCR product was subjected to double digestion and was ligated into an ampicillin-resistant pDZ1 expression vector (a modified form of pET-21A vector) that has the T7 promoter. The resultant construct consisted of the following regions: N-terminal His 6 -tag, GB1 solubility tag, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, and N-terminal domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Stm1(Stm1_N 1-113 ). 2. Later, the expression construct pDZ1 of Stm1_N 1-113 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Bioline), plated on the LB agar plate supplemented with ampicillin, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Following incubation, a single colony was picked from the above-transformed plate and added to 10 mL of LB media, which was then incubated at 37 °C overnight while shaking at 210 rpm. 1 mL of this was added to 1 L of LB medium containing 100 mg/L ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37 °C with shaking at 210 rpm until the optical density (OD 600 ) reached approximately 0.6. At this point, protein expression was induced using 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the culture was incubated further at 18 °C overnight to allow optimal expression. 3. Cells were then harvested and sonicated in binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to inhibit proteolysis. The expressed protein was purified using a two-step protocol based on Ni 2+ –nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni 2+ –NTA) affinity chromatography columns. 4. Initially, the His6- and GB1-tagged fusion protein was purified and eluted using an elution buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, and 200 mM imidazole (pH 8.0). The eluted protein was then subjected to overnight digestion with TEV protease to remove the GB1 fusion protein attached with His 6 tag. A second round of Ni 2+ -NTA purification was performed to separate the cleaved Stm1_N 1-113 (recovered in the binding buffer fraction) from the tags (collected in the elution fraction). 5. Following purification, the protein was dialyzed against phosphate buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate and either 10 mM or 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4). The dialyzed sample was concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration device with a 3 KDa molecular weight cutoff. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient (ε) of 5,500 (M -1 ·cm -1 ). 6. Aβ42, the peptide used for validating the protocol, was purchased from Biotech Desk (product ID: RP10017-1) and mixed either in water or in 10 mM phosphate buffer and 150 mM NaCl to mimic physiological conditions. B. Mica sheet preparation Note: The AFM sample preparation protocol is outlined in Figure 2 and detailed below. It is recommended to use a laminar flow hood to prepare a mica sheet coated with an amyloid protein at room temperature. 1. Before starting the experiment, sterilize all lab accessories (forceps, mica sheet cutter, etc., as shown in Figure 1a ) by wiping with 70% ethanol, followed by UV exposure for 20 min. 2. Place a folded disposable wipe inside an open Petri plate in such a way that the tissue sits within the plate. 3. Using a mica sheet cutter, gently divide a mica sheet of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm into four equal parts (viz., 0.75 cm × 0.75 cm each). Take one of them for the experiment. Rinse the mica sheet surface by pipetting 1 mL of Milli-Q water on both sides and gently dry it using disposable wipes ( Figure 3a –c). 4. Place each mica sheet vertically inside a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and dry it in a desiccator for 30 min ( Figure 3d ). 5. Subsequently, dip the mica sheet in 1 mL of Milli-Q water in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for 1 h ( Figure 3e , f). 6. After incubation, remove the mica sheet and dry it again in a desiccator for 2 h, placing it vertically in a fresh 1.5 mL tube ( Figure 3g ). Critical: Always handle the mica sheet with forceps, ensuring only the tip of the sheet is in contact with the forceps to avoid damage. Figure 2.

(c) Removal of excess water. (d) Drying of the mica sheet. (e) Dipping of the mica sheet in milli-Q water. (f) Incubation in milli-Q water. (g) Drying of the mica sheet. C. APTES coating 1. Using forceps, transfer the dried mica sheet into 1 mL of APTES in a fresh 1.5 mL tube and incubate it for 30 min ( Figure 4 ). 2. After incubation, gently wash both sides of the mica sheet by passing about 1 mL of Milli-Q water three times using a 1 mL pipette to remove the excess APTES. 3. Following this, dip the APTES-charged mica sheet in 1 mL of Milli-Q water and incubate it for 1 h to remove the residual APTES from the mica sheet. 4. After incubation, rinse the mica sheet again gently using 3 mL of Milli-Q water and dry it in a desiccator by placing the mica sheet in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for a minimum of 2 h. Figure 4. Preparation of the APTES-coated mica sheet. (a) Dried mica sheet taken out from the desiccator. (b) Dipping of the mica sheet in APTES. (c) Incubation of the mica sheet in APTES. D. Protein loading and salt removal 1. Take out the APTES-coated dried mica sheet and dip it in ~1 mL of the amyloid protein sample for 30 min in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Note that both sides of the mica sheet are coated with the protein of interest ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5. Preparation of a protein-coated mica sheet for analysis. (a) Washing of the mica sheet. (b) Removal of excess water. (c) Drying of APTES-coated mica sheet. (d) Dipping of the mica sheet in the sample. (e) Incubation of the mica sheet in the protein sample. (f) Drying of the mica sheet. 2. Immediately after, proceed to washing with 2 mL of Milli-Q water to remove unbound proteins. 3. Again, dip the protein-coated mica sheet in 1 mL of Milli-Q water in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for 5–6 h. This step removes excess salt (present in the protein sample) from the mica sheet and facilitates the removal of residual protein deposits from the mica sheet. Critical: The incubation time of 5–6 h used here is for the 150 mM NaCl present in the protein sample. This time may vary for different types of proteins and salt concentrations. 4. After dipping in Milli-Q water, rinse the mica sheet with 2 mL of Milli-Q water. 5. Dry the washed mica sheet in a desiccator, placing it vertically inside a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Critical: It is important to note the face of the mica sheet that will be imaged, as an adhesive tape will be attached to one face of the mica sheet while performing AFM imaging. E. AFM imaging 1. Mount the dried, protein-coated mica sheet onto the AFM sample plate using adhesive tape. Although adhesive tape reduces the drift of the mica sheet, it can still allow nanoscale movement. Thus, careful pressing at the mica sheet edges is required. 2. Mount the cantilever (Park Systems, product number: NSC36_C) by removing Park Systems NX10’s head while the laser beam is turned off. Subsequently, mount the cantilever gently by holding it between the index and thumb fingers. 3. Acquire AFM images using the tapping mode in the Park Systems NX10 atomic force microscope. Perform a frequency sweep to set drive frequency and amplitude near the cantilever’s resonance frequency (65 KHz). Frequency is kept constant with a stable height based on the sample type during image acquisition using the AFM equipment’s feedback loop. 4. Open the TIF image of the Z-height AFM file using XEI software. 5. To reduce noise and provide a better signal-to-noise ratio, perform image flattening and adjust color gradient filters for better resolution in XEI software. 6. Finally, export the image as a .png file. 7. Add an appropriate scale bar using Microsoft PowerPoint and export the image.\n\nValidation of protocol Validation of the presented protocol, namely the dip-washing method, was carried out by considering a 400 μM concentration of the amyloidogenic Stm1_N 1-113 protein [24] ( Figure 6 ) and 100 μM ( Figure 7 ) and 10 μM ( Figure 8 ) concentrations of Aβ42. Figure 6. Representative atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of mica sheets at different stages of the protocol. (a) Empty mica sheet. (b) Unwashed mica sheet coated with 10 mM NaCl. (c) Mica sheet coated with 10 mM NaCl after washing with 200 μL of Milli-Q water. Note the partial removal of salt from the mica surface. (d) Mica sheet coated with 10 mM NaCl after washing with 3 mL of Milli-Q water. Note the complete removal of salt from the mica surface. (e) Unwashed mica sheet with 150 mM NaCl. (f) Mica sheet with 150 mM NaCl after washing with 200 μL of Milli-Q water. Note the significant presence of salt in the mica surface. (g) Mica sheet with 150 mM NaCl after washing with 3 mL of Milli-Q water. Note the removal of salts from the mica surface. (h) Mica sheet coated with 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM phosphate buffer (blank) after washing with 3 mL of Milli-Q water. Note the significant presence of salt deposits. (i) A dominance of salt fibrils (branched fibril morphology unlike amyloid or amyloid-like fibrils) hindering the fibril formation of Stm1_N 1-113 occurs when washed simply with 3 mL of Milli-Q water. (j) Amyloid-like fibrils of 400 μM Stm1_N 1-113 protein are seen when the protein was coated onto the mica sheet using the dip-washing protocol presented here. Note the absence of salt. Figure 6 illustrates the importance of using the dip-washing method presented here to coat an amyloid protein sample onto a mica sheet. To demonstrate this, we show AFM images of an empty mica sheet ( Figure 6a ), an unwashed mica sheet coated with 10 mM NaCl ( Figure 6b ), and a mica sheet washed with 200 μL ( Figure 6c ) and 3 mL ( Figure 6d ) of Milli-Q water after coating with 10 mM NaCl. It can be seen that 3 mL of Milli-Q water wash completely removed the salt, compared to a 200 μL water wash. A similar trend was observed when a physiological salt concentration of 150 mM NaCl was coated on the mica sheet ( Figure 6f –g). However, salt deposits were still present on the mica sheet even after 3 mL of Milli-Q water pipette-washing when 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM phosphate buffer were used ( Figure 6h ). This further worsened when Stm1_N 1-113 , prepared in 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM phosphate, was coated on the mica sheet ( Figure 6i ). As seen in Figure 6i , the salt fibrils (branched fibril morphology unlike amyloid or amyloid-like fibrils) hinder the fibril formation of Stm1_N 1-113 on the mica sheet. However, the dip-washing method completely removed the salt fibrils, facilitating amyloid-like fibrillation of 400 μM Stm1_N 1-113 protein ( Figure 6j ). Application of the protocol in characterizing human Aβ42 amyloid fibrils The protocol established here was extended to human Aβ42, which is a key factor in Alzheimer’s disease. Figure 7 illustrates the AFM images of human Aβ42 (dissolved in water) coated on a mica sheet using the dip-washing protocol, illustrating the efficacy of this protocol in capturing the amyloid fibrillation of any protein. Figure 7. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of Aβ42 fibril (100 μM) captured after using the dip-washing protocol to coat the fibrils on the mica sheet. (a) 2D and (b) 3D image of Aβ42 fibrils. Figure 8 represents the comparative analyses of AFM images collected by the pipette-washing ( Figure 8a ) and dip-washing methods ( Figure 8b ). This analysis was performed using a 10 μM concentration of Aβ42 fibril mixed in 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM phosphate buffer. Note the persistence of salt, represented in Areas 1 and 2 in Figure 8a (inset: enlarged 2 × 2 μm scan of the selected areas from a 5 × 5 μm scan). In contrast, the 2 × 2 μm scan of the AFM image captured after dip-washing has no such salt deposits. Figure 8.

    "title": "Preparation of Chromatin Fragments From Human Cells for Cryo-EM Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomic DNA is packaged into chromatin, which plays a critical role in regulating gene expression by dynamically modulating its higher-order structure. While in vitro reconstitution approaches have offered valuable insights into chromatin organization, they often fail to fully capture the native structural context found within cells. To overcome this limitation, we present a protocol for isolating native chromatin fragments from human cells for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis. In this method, chromatin from formaldehyde-crosslinked human HeLa S3 nuclei is digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to generate mono- and poly-nucleosome fragments. These fragments are subsequently fractionated by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation and prepared for cryo-EM. The resulting chromatin fragments retain native-like nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, facilitating structural analyses of chromatin organization under near-physiological conditions. Key features • Chemical crosslinking preserves the native nucleosome-nucleosome interactions in chromatin fragments. • Optimal MNase digestion conditions efficiently solubilize chromatin into mono- and poly-nucleosome fragments for cryo-EM analysis. • This protocol may be adaptable to other types of cells.",

Cell culture and harvest 1. Seed HeLa S3 cells in 10 cm culture dishes in 10 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin (1.0 × 10 6 cells/dish). 2. Culture the cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . 3. When the cells reach a subconfluent state (approximately 70%–80% confluency), repeat passaging of the cells. Note: A total of 2 × 10 7 cells (~4 dishes) is the minimum amount required for cryo-EM analysis. 4. Aspirate the medium and wash the cells twice with 5 mL of PBS prechilled at 4 °C. 5. Harvest the subconfluent cells with a cell scraper. 6. Resuspend the harvested cells in 10 mL of cold PBS and transfer the suspension to a 15 mL conical tube. 7. Count the cells using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer. 8. Centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant using a pipette. 9. Place the tube on ice. B. Nuclei isolation, crosslinking, and sonication 1. Resuspend the cell pellet in cold CERI buffer (from NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents) to a concentration of 1.0 × 10 7 cells/mL. Note: Nuclei isolation using CERI and CERII buffers was performed entirely according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 2. Add 1/100 volume of protease inhibitor cocktail. 3. Vortex the tube for 15 s and place it on ice for 10 min. 4. Add 55 μL of cold CERII buffer (from NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents) per 1 mL of sample, then vortex for 5 s. 5. Place the tube on ice for 1 min, then vortex for 5 s. 6. Centrifuge at 16,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant using a pipette. 7. Resuspend the nuclear pellet in cold PBS to a concentration of 1.0 × 10 7 nuclei/mL, calculated from the initial cell number. 8. Dispense 500 μL of the sample into tubes (0.5 × 10 7 nuclei/tube). 9. Add formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and mix by pipetting and inverting the tube. 10. Incubate the sample for 5 min at room temperature. 11. Add 2 M glycine to a final concentration of 150 mM and mix by pipetting and inverting the tube. 12. Incubate the sample for 3 min at room temperature. 13. Centrifuge at 16,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant using a pipette. 14. Resuspend the nuclear pellet in buffer A [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0.5% NP-40] to a concentration of 2.0 × 10 7 nuclei/500 μL (4.0 × 10 7 nuclei/mL) and place it on ice. Note: The nuclear pellet does not need to be fully resuspended, as it tends to be very sticky. However, it is advisable to resuspend it as much as possible by pipetting and during the subsequent sonication step (vortexing is ineffective for resuspension). 15. Dispense 500 μL aliquots of the sample into tubes and keep them on ice. 16. Sonicate the nuclear suspension using a VP-050N ultrasonic homogenizer (TAITEC) equipped with a microtip (2 mm in diameter) under the following conditions: PWM = 20%, 3 s on/7 s off, for 6 cycles ( Figure 1A ). 17. Place the sample on ice. Figure 1. Sonication of nuclear suspension and MNase titration for chromatin fragmentation. (A) Photographs showing the sonication process used for nuclear suspension. (B) Agarose gel electrophoresis of chromatin fragmented by varying units of MNase. A 10 μL portion of each sample with (+) or without (–) proteinase K treatment was applied to the agarose gel, electrophoresed in 1× TAE buffer, and stained with EtBr. The extent of chromatin fragmentation by MNase was estimated based on the nucleosomal DNA bands observed in the proteinase K-treated sample (+). C. Titration of MNase for chromatin fragmentation 1. Prepare MNase solutions at the desired concentrations by performing serial dilutions. Example: Prepare MNase solutions at 200, 40, 8, 1.6, and 0.32 U/µL. Note: Dilute MNase using buffer A, since diluting MNase in Milli-Q water may reduce its enzymatic activity. These MNase concentrations are provided as a reference. Higher concentrations can also be prepared if required. 2. Collect a portion of the sample and treat it with MNase solution. Example: Collect 10 μL of the sample into each of five tubes and mix the sample with 0.5 μL of MNase at the indicated concentrations by pipetting. 3. Incubate the samples for 40 min at 37 °C. 4. Add 0.5 M EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. 5. Centrifuge at 16,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatants. 6. Place the tubes on ice. 7. Collect a portion of the MNase-treated samples and add the proteinase K mix, then incubate the sample for 15 min at 37 °C. Example: From the 10 μL MNase-treated sample, 5 μL was mixed with 0.5 μL of the proteinase K mix. The remaining 5 μL was used directly for gel electrophoresis. Note: Proteinase K remains active under the 10 mM EDTA conditions used for quenching the MNase digestion. 8. Add 30% (w/v) sucrose to each sample (with or without proteinase K treatment) to a final concentration of 5% (w/v). Example: Add 1 μL of 30% sucrose to 5 μL of each sample. 9. Apply the samples to a 1.5% agarose gel and perform electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer. 10. Soak the gel in EtBr (0.5 µg/mL) and gently shake for 10 min. 11. Transfer the gel to Milli-Q water and gently shake for 10 min. 12. Image the gel using a UV transilluminator ( Figure 1B ). Note: Determine the appropriate MNase concentration for chromatin fragmentation by evaluating the DNA band pattern of proteinase K-treated samples. D. Chromatin fragmentation by MNase and ultracentrifugation 1. Prepare the gradient solution [10%–50% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT] using a Gradient Master 108 at room temperature in ultra-clear tubes (14 × 89 mm). 2. Chill the prepared gradient at 4 °C prior to ultracentrifugation. 3. Pre-incubate the remaining sample for 5 min at 37 °C prior to MNase treatment. 4. Add MNase to the remaining sample, based on the conditions determined in the titration experiment. 5. Incubate the sample for 40 min at 37 °C. 6. Add 0.5 M EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. 7. Centrifuge at 16,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant (~500 μL) using a pipette without disturbing the pellet. 8. Apply the fragmented chromatin onto the top of the gradient solution ( Figure 2A ). Note: As a control for the fractionation step, reserve a portion of the fragmented chromatin sample (as input) prior to centrifugation and store it on ice. 9. Centrifuge at ~210,000× g (35,000 rpm, using an SW 41 Ti rotor) for 21 h at 4 °C, using an Optima XPN-80 ultracentrifuge. Figure 2. Separation of chromatin fragments by ultracentrifugation. (A) Photograph of sample application onto the top of the gradient solution. (B) Fractionation of chromatin fragments from the gradient solution after ultracentrifugation. (C) Agarose gel electrophoresis of chromatin fractions obtained by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Chromatin was fragmented with 4 units of MNase per 10 μL of sample and then subjected to ultracentrifugation. A 20 μL portion of each fraction was applied to the agarose gel, electrophoresed in 1× TAE buffer, and stained with EtBr. Fractions enclosed by magenta dashed boxes were combined, subjected to buffer exchange, and subsequently concentrated. E. Fractionation, buffer exchange, and concentration of chromatin fragments 1. Fractionate the solution by collecting 660 μL aliquots from the top of the gradient and place them on ice ( Figure 2B ). 2. Collect portions of the fractionated samples, add the proteinase K mix, and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Example: Collect 20 μL of the fraction and mix with 2 μL of the proteinase K mix by pipetting. For the input sample, mix 5 μL of the input with 0.5 μL of the proteinase K mix by pipetting. 3. Apply the proteinase K-treated fractions to a 1.5% agarose gel and perform electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer. 4. Soak the gel in EtBr and gently shake for 10 min. 5. Transfer the gel to Milli-Q water and gently shake for 10 min. 6. Image the gel using a UV transilluminator ( Figure 2C ). 7. Combine the fractions that contain similar DNA fragment lengths, as estimated from the proteinase K-treated samples. 8. Exchange the buffer of the combined fractions using a PD-10 column (Cytiva) to Buffer B [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT]. 9. Concentrate the fractions with an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit (30,000 MWCO). 10. Measure the dsDNA concentration of fractions with a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer. F. Grid preparation of chromatin fragments 1. Hydrophilize Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 200-mesh Cu grids by glow discharge, using a PIB-10 set to soft mode with a 2 min timer. 2. Perform the following steps using a Vitrobot Mark IV at 4 °C under 100% humidity. 3. Apply 2.5 μL of the samples onto the glow-discharged grids. 4. Blot the samples for 4–6 s (wait time: 0 s; blot force: 0; blot total: 1; drain time: 0 s). 5. Plunge the grids into liquid ethane and mount them into a C-clip and C-clip ring. 6. Store the grids in liquid nitrogen. 7. Acquire micrographs using cryo-EM ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Micrographs of chromatin extracted from HeLa cells. Images were acquired using a Krios G4 cryo-TEM equipped with an energy-filtered K3 detector (Gatan). Data were collected at 300 kV accelerating voltage and 81,000× magnification (corresponding to a pixel size of 1.06 Å), with a defocus setting of -2.5 µm. Each micrograph was generated from 40 movie frames acquired in the electron counting mode over a total exposure time of 4.5 s, resulting in a total dose of ~60 e-/Å 2 . Scale bars represent 100 nm. Representative mono-, di-, and poly-nucleosomes are enclosed by white dotted lines.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol is an optimized version of the chromatin preparation method for cryo-EM analysis previously described in our original research article: Hatazawa et al.

    "title": "A Quantitative Spectrophotometric Assay Matched With Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy to Measure Calcium Crystals in Human Osteoarthritic Synovial Fluid.",
    "abstract": "In the field of osteoarthritis (OA), the identification of reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with hip lesions such as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) could have an immeasurable value. Calcium crystal detection in synovial fluids (SFs) is one tool currently available to diagnose patients with rheumatologic disorders. Crystals, such as monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate (CPP), are identified qualitatively by compensated polarized light, whereas basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are visualized under conventional light microscopy by Alizarin red S (ARS) staining. Here, we present an efficient and straightforward protocol to quantify calcium crystals by spectrophotometric analysis in human osteoarthritic SFs after staining with ARS. The type and size of the different crystal species are confirmed by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Key features • This protocol provides a quantitative assay to measure calcium crystals in human synovial fluids. • ARS is specific for hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium phosphate, calcium chloride/pyrophosphate dihydrate, and oxalate crystals; does not show any combination with SFs components. • The standard curve for crystal quantification was prepared with a synthetic hydroxyapatite, which allows to prepare a series of stable and reproducible standards. • The analysis with ESEM determines the elemental composition of all visible particles without any pretreatment of the biological sample prior to observation.",

Prepare the standard curve with a series of standards (STDs) across a range of concentrations near the expected concentration of the unknown samples. OA samples selected for the present procedure were collected from patients with late OA undergoing total hip replacement, previously selected for the presence of calcium crystals visualized roughly by light microscopy. 2. Prepare the reference standards for the quantification with serial dilution 1:2 in PBS of HAP from a 10 mg/mL working solution as follows: 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.15, and 0.078 mg/mL [10]. Include the 10 mg/mL concentration in the standard curve. 3. Stain 100 μL of each serial dilution point with ARS as described in Section B. Note: Minimize error by using proper pipetting technique, holding the tip perpendicular to and just below the liquid surface. Holding it at an angle or deep under the surface can result in inaccurate volumes. Critical: Carefully mix each dilution point before performing the serial dilution. B. Staining with ARS 1. Thaw an aliquot of SF collected from OA patients by aspiration. Gently mix the SF before collecting the volume for the analysis without any pretreatment to avoid any possible loss of crystals during the procedure. 2. Add 100 μL of ARS solution to 100 μL of synovial fluid sample and standards, as prepared in section A, for crystal staining in a 1.5 mL conical vial. Vortex and incubate for 30 min at RT the 200 μL of STDs (prepared as described in Section A) and 200 μL of SFs mixed with ARS. After incubation, centrifuge the samples at 10,391× g for 10 min to obtain the crystal pellet. 3. After aspiration of the supernatant with a 1 mL tip, wash the pellets with 500 μL of distilled water at 10,391× g for 10 min. After supernatant discarding by aspiration with a 1 mL tip, add 300 μL of 10% acetic acid to the pellets to extract calcium crystals and incubate for 30 min at RT. 4. After centrifugation at 10,391× g for 10 min to eliminate possible debris, add 50 μL of 3% ammonium hydroxide to the samples to neutralize the acid [10]. Critical: Carefully aspirate the supernatant without touching the pellets to avoid possible disaggregation and loss of stained crystals. C. Calcium crystals measurement by spectrophotometric analysis 1. Add 150 μL per well of samples and standards (SFs in duplicate and STDs in triplicate) in a 96-well plate and immediately read the absorbance at 510 nm with a plate reader [11]. Figure 1 shows the STD concentrations plotted on the X-axis and the absorbance on the Y-axis. Critical: Read the absorbance of the samples within 15 min due to the stability of the samples. Figure 1. Four-parameter logistic (4PL) standard curve (R-squared = 0.9592). The STD concentrations are plotted on the X-axis and the absorbance on the Y-axis. STD, standard; LOD, limit of detection; LOL, limit of linearity. D. Sample setup for ESEM analysis Deposit 40 μL of SF samples on the aluminum stub previously covered with a conductive carbon adhesive disk and incubate the sample ( Figure 2 ) in a humid chamber at 4 °C for 24–48 h before the analysis. Note: The ESEM analysis of the elements present in the synovial fluid is a simple technique, as the samples are deposited without any type of treatment on the stub and observed after overnight incubation. Figure 2. Aluminum stub covered with a conductive carbon adhesive disk (arrow) on the stub support inside the SEM camera (asterisk) E. Calcium crystals identification by ESEM-EDS 1. Analyze the samples using a focused electron beam in a vacuum electron gun, with a pressure of 5.0 × 10 -6 mbar. Note. Use the ESEM in low-vacuum mode, with a specimen chamber pressure set at approximately 0.80 mbar, an accelerating voltage of 25 kV, a working distance of 10 mm, a tilt angle of 0°, a variable beam diameter, and a magnification between 250 and 120,000×. 2. Obtain the images by means of the back-scattered electron detector to highlight the presence of particles or aggregates. The spectrometric unit is equipped with an ECON (Edax Carbon Oxigen Nitrogen) 6 utw X-ray detector. 3. Analyze each sample with a time count of 100 s, an ampere time of 51, and a probe current of 290 μA. 4. Evaluate the central stub area considering the area with a diffuse presence of the crystal, excluding big crystal aggregates. Prepare the samples under complete sterility, changing the pipette for each sample. 5. Collect the morphometric data (number, size, and morphology) of all visible particles in the reference area through accurate observations and measurements in several ESEM images. For image analysis, use Photoshop and ImageJ software. 6. Select the images following two main criteria: (i) to be representative of the total area of each sample examined and (ii) to have a significant number of measurements. Examples of background images ( Figure 3 ) and particles ( Figure 4 ) are shown in Figure 3A and 3B . Note: In the different single areas, examples of electrodense particles: 1) small particles with sizes ranging from 20 to 80 nm (not only calcium but also phosphate, sulfur, and potassium) in Figure 3 ; 2 ) big calcium particles with dimensions between 2 and 10 μm in Figure 4 . 7. Use the ESEM-EDS equipment to determine the elemental composition of all visible particles in the selected area. Figures 3B and 4B show the composition (in % atomic) of the different types of particles detected. Critical: The only precaution is to wait the same amount of time for all samples to obtain an effective and correct analysis. One minute of evaporation for 40 μL liquid samples is sufficient for an adequate analysis. For reproducible data, the same operator prepared the entire series of samples. Figure 3. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) analysis of the elements present in different areas of the background and evaluation of the elemental chemical composition of individual particles. (A) Low-magnification image (286×) acquired using backscattered electrons. Numerous particles (bright spots) are visible within a darker background matrix (synovial fluid). (B) Example of a spectrum showing the elemental chemical composition of a single particle. The table shows the weight percentages and atomic percentages of the detected elements (Elem = element; Wt = weight; At = atom). Figure 4. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) analysis of the single element and evaluation of the elemental chemical composition. (A) Medium-magnification image (11,597×) acquired using backscattered electrons. A very bright particle is visible at the center, embedded in a dark organic aggregate. (B) Spectrum showing the elemental chemical composition of the bright particle in panel A. The table shows the weight percentages and atomic percentages of the detected elements (Elem = element; Wt = weight; At = atom).\n\nValidation of protocol As for the ESEM analysis, in the absence of a standardized analytical procedure for the measurement of calcium crystals in synovial fluids using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we adopted an analytical approach inspired by the current methodology used for the detection of hazardous mineral fibers on filters from environmental sampling (reference standard: UNI EN ISO 14966:2021). This method involves the identification and quantification of hazardous fibers by SEM within a 1 mm area on a polycarbonate filter, following environmental sampling. The analysis is conducted along a predefined geometric path, which ensures complete coverage of the selected surface without field overlap, at magnifications exceeding 2,000×.",

    "title": "An Imaging-Based Assay to Measure the Location of PD-1 at the Immune Synapse for Testing the Binding Efficacy of Anti-PD-1 and Anti-PD-L1 Antibodies.",
    "abstract": "PD-1 is an immune checkpoint on T cells. Antibodies to PD-1 or its ligand PD-L1 are gaining popularity as a leading immunotherapy approach. In the US, 40% of all cancer patients will be treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies but, unfortunately, only 30% will respond, and many will develop immune-related adverse events. There are nine FDA-approved anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, and approximately 100 are in different stages of clinical development. It is a clinical challenge to choose the correct antibody for a given patient, and this is critical in advanced malignancies, which often do not permit a second-line intervention. To resolve that, an in vitro assay to compare the performance of the different anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies is not only a critical tool for research purposes but also a possible tool for personalized medicine. There are some assays describing the binding affinity and function of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. However, a significant limitation of existing assays is that they need to consider the location of PD-1 in the immune synapse, the interface between the T cell and tumor cells, and, therefore, ignore a critical component in its biology. To address this, we developed and validated an imaging-based assay to quantify and compare the ability of different anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies to remove PD-1 from the immune synapse. We correlated that with the same antibodies' ability to increase cytokine secretion from the targeted cells. The strong correlation between PD-1 location and its function in vitro and in vivo within the antibody treatment setting validates this assay's usability, which is easily recordable and straightforward. Key features • Live-cell imaging quantifies and compares how anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies disrupt PD-1 localization, causing the removal of PD-1 during immune synapse formation. • Hao et al. [1] validated the protocol, and the findings were extended to a live confocal microscopy method. • It requires a Zeiss LSM 900 confocal microscope and appropriate imaging software and is optimized for the latest version of Zen Blue. • Anti-PD-1 antibodies are commonly used in cancer therapies, and this protocol optimizes the analysis of their effectiveness.",

However, primary T cells can also be used following transfection/viral transduction with a fluorescent PD-1 expression vector in combination with Raji cells [20]. Fluorescent T and B cell lines can be generated as described in Lerrer et al. [21]. Day 1 Note: If activation via CD3/CD28/CD2 ImmunoCult T-cell activator for T cells is needed, the steps delineated for day 1 and below for day 2 must be done separately. Otherwise, the steps for day 1 and day 2 can be combined into a single day. See Figure 1 . Figure 1. Timeline of the cell preparation protocol. Timelines for the protocol A) with T-cell activation or B) without T-cell activation are given. Steps shown on the same tick mark are to be completed in parallel. Steps should be completed in the order shown and according to the protocol written. Maintain T and B cells in T75 flasks with 12–15 mL of RPMI (w/ FBS) media (see Recipes) at the appropriate optimal growing concentrations. ~2 × 10 5 to 2 × 10 6 cells/mL are optimal growing concentrations for Jurkat. ~3 × 10 5 to 2 × 10 6 cells/mL are optimal growing concentrations for Raji. Collect around 5 mL from flasks and ensure that any clumps are broken up with pipetting. Count viable T cells manually or using an automated cell counter with Trypan Blue. Take 10 µL of cells and 10 µL of Trypan Blue. Mix with a pipette. If counting using an automated cell counter: i. Add 10 µL of the mixture to a cell counting chamber slide. ii. Insert the slide into an automated cell counter, with the side containing the cell/Trypan mixture inserted first. iii. Focus the machine, press scan, and record cell viability as reported. If counting manually: i. Take 10 µL of the mixture and add it to a single chamber of the KOVA TM Glasstic TM slide. ii. Place the slide under a microscope and count the number of viable cells per grid using an appropriate magnification to visualize cells in each box. 1) Viable cells will appear shiny or bright, whereas nonviable or dead cells will be permeable to the Trypan Blue dye and appear darker. iii. Calculate the number of viable cells by converting 10 viable cells/box = 2 million viable cells/mL. 1) Count multiple boxes, convert, and then average the resulting viable cell numbers together to get the most accurate estimate of total cell viability. Calculate the appropriate volume needed for 10 6 viable cells (or more, if desired) and centrifuge the cells at 500× g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge tube. If needed, centrifuge in a 15 mL or 50 mL tube at 500× g , and then resuspend and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube. Remove the supernatant and leave around 50 µL of media. Add fresh RPMI (w/ FBS) media to a final concentration of 10 6 cells per milliliter (950 µL of media if 10 6 cells were used in step A5). Move isolated 10 6 cells (total volume 1 mL) to one well of a 24-well cell culture plate for overnight culture. Add 12.5 µL of CD3/CD28/CD2 ImmunoCult T-cell activator for T cells per milliliter and incubate overnight (not necessary for PD-1-expressing Jurkat cells) at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. Day 2 Note: Both day 1 and day 2 steps can be done on the same day if overnight T-cell activation is not necessary, e.g., when using PD-1-expressing Jurkat cells. See Figure 1 . Repeat steps 2–6 from Day 1 for B cells or perform in parallel for B and T cells if overnight T-cell activation was not performed. Collect around 5 mL from flasks and ensure that any clumps are broken up with pipetting. Count viable cells manually or using an automated cell counter with Trypan Blue, as described in the steps for day 1. Calculate the appropriate volume needed for 10 6 viable cells (or more, if desired) and centrifuge them in a microcentrifuge tube at 500× g for 5 min. If needed, centrifuge in a 15 mL or 50 mL tube at 500× g , and then resuspend and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube. Remove the supernatant and leave around 50 µL of media. Add Opti-MEM media to a final concentration of 10 6 cells per milliliter (950 µL of media if 10 6 cells were used in step 1d). If T-cell activation is required, change the media with the T-cell activator solution to fresh media. Collect cells from the well into a microcentrifuge tube. Spin cells down at 500× g for 5 min. If desired, this spin can be done at the same time as the spin for step 1. Remove supernatant, leaving up to 50 µL above the cells, and resuspend in 1 mL Opti-MEM media. Add 5 µL of Staphylococcus enterotoxin E (SEE) working stock (see Recipes) for each 1 mL of B cells and incubate at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator for 30–60 min in the microcentrifuge tube. Add the desired amount of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies to the appropriate tube and incubate at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator for 30–60 min in the microcentrifuge tubes: If an anti-PD-1 antibody is to be tested, add the antibody to the T-cell tube. i. Add the anti-PD-1 antibody in parallel with the Staphylococcus enterotoxin E (SEE) so that both T and B cells will incubate for 30–60 min. If an anti-PD-L1 antibody is to be tested, add the antibody to the B-cell tube. i. Add the anti-PD-L1 antibody in parallel with the Staphylococcus enterotoxin E (SEE) so that both will incubate with the B cells for 30–60 min. ii. Keep the T-cell tube incubating at 37 °C during this process. During T-cell and B-cell incubation, coat MatTek plates with 200 µL of 1× Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) (see Recipes) solution for 30–45 min at room temperature or 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. Remove PLL from the plate via vacuum before plating cells. Note: No wash is needed after removing the PLL. Add 100 µL (10 5 cells) of treated B cells to a MatTek dish and let them settle for 5 min at room temperature. Note: This step does not have to be done in a sterile hood. Add 100 µL (10 5 cells) of T cells on top of the previously plated B cells. Note: Ensure that T cells are added dropwise from the air, gently and evenly over the plate, to help maximize cell dispersion and minimize air bubble formation. Let the combined solution settle for at least 10 min at room temperature before imaging. Store microcentrifuge tubes with remaining treated B and T cells in a mini block heater at 37 °C, covered with tin foil to prevent photobleaching. Imaging of T and B cells synapse formation Note: Before proceeding with this protocol portion, ensure that the microscope is turned on and calibrated and that Zen Blue software is functional. Load MatTek plate with cell solution (200 µL total) onto the microscope stage and center above 10× objective for initial observations of cell settling in the plate. Note: Be gentle with the transfer and ensure that the cell solution is not disturbed from the center of the plate. Locate the area of interest on the MatTek plate using the 10× objective and eyepiece to ensure that cells have fully settled in. Remove the MatTek plate from the microscope stage and change to 63× objective with a small amount of oil on the lens. Note: To prevent damage to the lens, ensure it is at the lowest Z-level before reloading the MatTek plate. Adjust the objective height to ensure cells are in focus. Note: The oil must touch the plate and the objective lens for clear images ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Oil is applied to the 63× objective lens, and contact is formed with the MatTek plate. Areas of interest are highlighted using white circles. A ) The microscope objective is at the lowest Z-position, with nothing placed on the lens. B ) The objective is at the lowest Z-position with a small amount of Immersol autofluorescence immersion oil applied to the lens. C ) The MatTek plate is centered above the lens without contact between the plate, oil, and lens. D ) MatTek plate centered above the lens with contact between the plate, oil, and lens formed by adjusting using the focus knobs. Select wavelengths in the fluorescence setting to be imaged. Adjust gain, intensity, and wavelength absorbance until the background is sufficiently low, but PD-1 and PD-L1 fluorescent signals can be imaged. Press Capture to take an image for further analysis when settings are acceptable. The colocalization of both fluorescent signals will evidence synapse formation in a “straight line” between B and T cells ( Figure 3 ). The number of synapses formed for each antibody tested can be used to visually analyze synapse abundance and quality. Count the number of synapses formed per X of pairs of T and B cells in contact with one another and compare the number of synapses counted between antibody treatment groups and the control group. Note: Synapses should be counted only when GFP-PD-1 is enriched in the contact area. Figure 3. Conjugates formation between Jurkat T cells and Raji B cells. Jurkat T cells expressing GFP-PD-1 were cocultured with Raji B cells expressing mCherry-PD-L1 and pulsed with SEE. The cells on the left panel ( A ) were imaged after 20 min of coculturing, while the cells on the right ( B ) were imaged after treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Without anti-PD-1 antibodies, GFP-PD-1 is enriched in the synapse between the Raji and the Jurkat cells (yellow arrows). Scale bar in 20 μm. Quantification of synapse intensity using microscopic colocalization analysis Note: A proper version of Zen Blue is recommended for this step. Other software, such as AIM or Image J, can also be utilized, but these steps are outlined explicitly for Zen Blue. For best results, use a .czi file. See Figure 4 . Figure 4. Colocalization analysis using ZEN Blue software. Areas of note are highlighted in white (colocalization tab, threshold adjustment bars, quadrant numbers, region of interest indicator, colocalization coefficients, region of interest tool, Costes auto threshold button, table option). For the example image, the colocalization coefficient to be recorded is 0.725, and the weighted colocalization coefficient to be recorded is 0.767, indicating that 72.5% of GFP-PD-1 signal colocalizes with mCherry-PD-L2 without taking into account pixel intensity, and 76% of GFP-PD-1 signal colocalizes with mCherry-PD-L2 when taking into account pixel intensity. A ) Click on the colocalization option on the sidebar. B ) Select the region of interest (ROI) using the shape tools. C ) Appropriately position the ROI over the synapse and ensure it remains selected. D1 ) Either manually adjust the bars on the cytofluorogram, or D2 ) Click the Costes button to auto-set the threshold bars with the selected region of interest using the mouse. E ) Click the table option to view the values for the localization coefficients. F ) Unweighted and weighted colocalization coefficient values will be listed from left to right (Colocalization Coefficient 1, Colocalization Coefficient 2, W Colocalization Coefficient 1, W Colocalization Coefficient 2). G ) Colocalization coefficient values for the region of interest (synapse) will be displayed in the table. After capturing the images, restart Zen Blue, select image processing , and open the images to be quantified in the image processing suite. Select colocalization on the sidebar. Markdown channels associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 fluorescence in the colocalization tab (e.g., GFP and mCherry). Note: Channels will usually be automatically labeled according to how they were captured during the image acquisition step. Utilize the region of interest (ROI) tool to mark areas where contact between T and B cells is observed. Notes: ROIs should not be limited to GFP-PD-1-enriched contact areas, especially in antibody treatment groups. This step can also be excluded if a whole image analysis is desired, in which case the rest of the protocol can be conducted similarly without an ROI. To ensure reproducibility, utilize the Costes auto threshold option by clicking the Costes button. Alternatively, if desired, select the crosshair option to set proper quadrants for use in colocalization analysis. Quadrants are labeled on the cytofluorogram. Quadrant 4 will contain pixels with low-intensity levels for both channels. Quadrants 1 and 2 will have high-intensity pixels in one of the channels. Quadrant 3 will contain pixels with high intensity in both channels. Cytofluorogram threshold bar placements can be determined using single fluorescence control samples to determine the optimal boundaries to eliminate background signals. Check the table option to view values for colocalization coefficients and compare between groups with higher colocalization coefficients indicative of more pixels with signals from both channels. The unweighted colocalization coefficient values (labeled Colocalization Coefficient 1 and Colocalization Coefficient 2 ) for the region of interest can be utilized to analyze colocalization. Values for weighted colocalization coefficients will range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no colocalization and 1 indicating complete colocalization. i. Unweighted colocalization coefficients are derived from Mander’s coefficients as described in Manders et al. [22]. ii. Weighted colocalization coefficient values (labeled as W Colocalization Coefficient 1 and W Colocalization Coefficient 2 on Zen Blue) consider pixel intensity in their calculation but otherwise use the same methodology as unweighted colocalization coefficient values. iii. Either coefficient can be utilized at one’s discretion. 1) Colocalization Coefficient 1 (or W Colocalization Coefficient 1) displays the percentage of the cytofluorogram horizontal axis channel that overlaps with the vertical axis channel. 2) Colocalization Coefficient 2 (or W Colocalization Coefficient 2) displays the percentage of the cytofluorogram vertical axis channel that overlaps with the horizontal axis channel. 3) Record the colocalization coefficient (or W Colocalization Coefficient) that correlates with the channel for PD-1. a) If PD-1 is the horizontal axis channel, use Colocalization Coefficient 1 (or W Colocalization Coefficient 1). b) If PD-1 is the vertical axis channel, use Colocalization Coefficient 2 (or W Colocalization Coefficient 2) Higher colocalization coefficient values mean increased colocalization of PD-1 and PD-L1 in the synapse, which indicates poorer antibody efficiency due to the lessened exclusion of PD-1 from the synapse. Note: Colocalization coefficients can be plotted in GraphPad Prism to analyze quantified synapse intensity values between antibody treatment groups. Multiple images for each antibody are used to ensure the colocalization coefficient derived is accurate. Alternative ImageJ quantification of synapse intensity using microscopic colocalization analysis Note: The JACoP plugin can be utilized as an alternative method for quantifying colocalization. Image processing can be optimally done using a Czi or TIFF file. If not already integrated, the JACoP plugin must be downloaded to the plugin folder in ImageJ. A region of interest cannot easily be specified using the JACoP plugin, so specific synapses must be preemptively isolated for analysis before using ImageJ. Please see the ImageJ website for more details regarding the usage of JACoP. Following capturing images, open the image to be quantified using ImageJ. Select Hyperstack for Stack viewing . Select Default for Color options and check the Autoscale box. Select Split channels to split into separate windows. Note: This will separate the PD-L1 and PD-1 fluorescent channels, allowing the JACoP plugin to work correctly. Select the Plugins tab and click JACoP . On the JACoP menu, select M1 and M2 coefficients , which will give Mander’s coefficients as calculated in Manders et al. [22]. M1 will give the percentage of channel 1 that overlaps with channel 2. M2 will give the percentage of channel 2 that overlaps with channel 1. Record the Mander’s coefficient that correlates with the channel for PD-1. For example, if PD-1 is labeled as channel 1, look at M1. Click the threshold tab and adjust thresholds for each channel. The area utilized for the colocalization analysis will appear in red when the threshold is adjusted. Once thresholding is satisfactory, click analyze . Results for M1 and M2 will appear in a separate window. M1 and M2 can be interpreted in the same manner as described for Zen colocalization analysis.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article(s): Hao et al.

    "abstract": "Visualization of cell structure with fluorescent dye for characterizing cell size, shape, and arrangement is a common method to study tissue morphology and morphogenesis. In order to observe shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis thaliana by laser scanning confocal microscopy, we modified the pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide staining method by adding a series solution treatment to stain the deep cells. The advantage of this method is mainly reflected by the direct observation of the clearly bounded cell arrangement and the typical three-layer cells in SAM without the traditional tissue slicing.",

Preparing 50 seedlings per condition is recommended for subsequent experiments. Place the solid MS medium plate in the growth chamber under 16 h/22 °C light and 8 h/18 °C darkness for nine days (or any desired growth conditions). Use 9-day-old seedlings for subsequent experiments. SAM dissection Using a single edge blade, cut the cotyledons and root to separate the other tissue from the shoot and leave the hypocotyl connected to the shoot tips ( Figure 1A and 1B ). Add 30 shoot tips to the centrifuge tube containing freshly prepared fixative solution (see Recipes) and leave at 4 °C overnight ( Figure 1C ). Pour out the fixative solution and wash the shoot tips with ddH 2 O twice. Pour out the water and add 30% ethanol solution for 15 min. Repeat this step with 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% ethanol series (see Recipes). Note: At this dehydrated stage, the shoot tips will turn white from the ethanol treatment ( Figure 1D ).

Transfer the shoot tips to new 100% ethanol overnight at room temperature. Note: At this stage, you can keep the shoot tips in ethanol at -20 °C for several weeks. Transfer the shoot tips to the 60 mm round culture dishes with 100% ethanol and place the culture dishes under the dissecting microscope ( Figure 2A ). Then, grip the hypocotyl with tweezers ( Figure 2B ) and remove the tiny true leaves from the shoot tip using a syringe needle under the dissecting microscope ( Figure 2C –2E). Subsequently, transfer the shoot tips to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube with 100% ethanol. Note: This sample is very small and easily broken; be sure to gently wash the sample with solution in the subsequent experiment. Figure 2. Dissection of shoot tips. A.

Scale bar: 500 μm. Staining of SAM Remove the 100% ethanol carefully and add 95% ethanol solution for 15 min. Repeat this step with 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, 30%, and 15% ethanol series and ddH 2 O. Then, wash the shoot tips with ddH 2 O once. Remove the water carefully and add 1 mL of 1% periodic acid solution (see Recipes) for 40 min. Then, wash the shoot tips with ddH 2 O twice. Remove the water carefully and add 1 mL of pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide solution (see Recipes) for 2 h. Wrap the centrifuge tube with aluminum foil to protect the shoot tips from light. Note: At this stage, the shoot tips will turn pink from the pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide solution. Protect the shoot tips from direct light in subsequent experiments ( Figure 3A ). Carefully remove the pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide solution and wash the shoot tips with ddH 2 O twice. Note: Because propidium iodide is toxic, discarded pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide solution requires a special waste container. Transfer the shoot tips to the microscope slide and blot dry the liquid around the sample with qualitative filter paper. Then, drop 10–20 μL of chloral hydrate solution (see Recipes) and leave for 20–30 min at room temperature, away from light ( Figure 3C ). Note: At this stage, the shoot tips will become transparent from chloral hydrate solution treatment ( Figure 3B ). Remove the chloral hydrate solution with qualitative filter paper and drop 100 μL of Hoyer′s solution (see Recipes) to cover the shoot tips. Then, carefully lay down a microscope cover glass, avoiding air bubbles ( Figure 3D ). Place the slides for three days at room temperature away from light. You can keep the slides at room temperature for several weeks. Figure 3. Staining of shoot tips. A. Centrifuge tube containing shoot tips in pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide solution.

Microscope slide with shoot tips in chloral hydrate solution. The arrow indicates the shoot tip. D. Microscope slide with shoot tips in Hoyer′s solution. The arrow indicates the shoot tip. Imaging of SAM Observe the shoot tips under a Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope with a microscope objective (Plan-apochromat 40×/1.3 Oil DIC M27). Set channel parameters as: excitation wavelength 514 nm; emission wavelength 566–658 nm; intensity of laser approximately 20%. Set the zoom 5× to magnify the image; resolution is 1,024 × 1,024. Set speed of scanning parameter as 7. Observe and image the different cell layers in the whole SAM by adjusting the z-axis. If you want a layer of cells, set the scan mode to x-y recording; if you want images of a complete SAM, set the scan mode to z-stack collection. In the x, y, z collection mode, set the parameter “line averaging” to achieve nice quality. In the central layer of SAM (Z10), you can observe typical three-layer cells ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4. Imaging of shoot tips. Series of SAM images with different z-axis obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscope. The arrow indicates the SAM; P indicates the leaf primordia; Z indicates different z-axis; white dashed lines in Z10 mark the cell layers. Scale bar: 50 μm.",

    "title": "Assessing the Toxoplasma Tachyzoite Cell Cycle Phases Using Fluorescent Ubiquitination-Based Cell Cycle Indicator.",
    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that infects a wide variety of eukaryotic hosts and causes toxoplasmosis. The cell cycle of T. gondii exhibits a distinct architecture and regulation that differ significantly from those observed in well-studied eukaryotic models. To better understand the tachyzoite cell cycle, we developed a fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system that enables real-time visualization and quantitative assessment of the different cell cycle phases via immunofluorescence microscopy. Quantitative immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging of the ToxoFUCCIS probe with specific cell cycle markers revealed substantial overlap between cell cycle phases S, G2, mitosis, and cytokinesis, further confirming the intricacy of the apicomplexan cell cycle. Key features • This protocol describes the development of the transgenic lines capable of detecting individual cell cycle phases and processes of the Toxoplasma tachyzoite cell cycle. • Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis and real-time microscopy enable the measurement of each cell cycle phase. • The ToxoFUCCIS probe helps to gain new insights into the highly flexible, overlapping nature of cell cycle organization in apicomplexan parasites.",

Retrieving gene information from the ToxoDB database (VEuPathDB) a. Genomic sequences and coding regions of T. gondii genes of interest were obtained from the ToxoDB database ( www.toxodb.org ). b. Find the nucleotide sequence of the coding 5’ and 3’ UTR regions of TgPCNA1 on the TGME49_247460 gene page. c. From the drop-down menu, located on the left, select “Sequences” to access and download the predicted genomic sequence. 2. Primer design and PCR amplification a. Use a forward and reverse primer with ligation-independent cloning (LIC) overhangs. The PCNA1 forward primer includes a 5’LIC overhang for vector annealing, fused to the TgPCNA1 5’UTR sequence. The 5’end of the reverse primer includes a LIC overhang for the vector annealing, followed by the last 27 nucleotides of TgPCNA1 ORF excluding the stop codon. PCNA1_For: tacttccaatccaatttaatgcacgaaatccgcggcacgc PCNA1_Rev: tcctccacttccaattttagcctcatccatcatagagtcgtccatgcc b. Purchase primers from Integrated DNA Technologies ( www.idtdna.com ). c.

Chill the reaction on ice for 2 min. Add 950 μL of SOC media and recover transformed cells in a bacterial shaker at 250 rpm for 60 min at 37 °C. Spread 100 μL of the transformed E.coli NEB5α cells onto LB agar plates with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C. Set up overnight liquid cultures of 6–8 individual colonies in 5 mL of LB broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Grow cultures in the bacterial shaker for 16–18 h at 250 rpm at 37 °C. e. Pellet E.coli NEB5α cells expressing pLIC-TgPCNA1-2xNeonGreen-DHFR plasmid in a tabletop centrifuge at 6,800× g for 3 min. Extract plasmid DNA using QIAGEN Prep Spin Miniprep kit.

Precipitate DNA in a 70% ethanol solution with 0.75 M ammonium acetate. Store at -20 °C until further use. 4. Parasite transfection, cloning, and selection of transgenic clones a. Culturing parasites: Infect a T-25 flask of confluent HFF cells with 10 6 freshly egressing RH TIR1 parasites. Grow parasites until they lyse 75%–80% of the host monolayer for 36–48 h at 37 °C. Release parasites from the host cells by passing the scraped monolayer through a blunt-end 23G needle 3–4 times. Separate parasites from the host cell remnants using a 3.0 μm pore-size filter and pellet them in a 1.7 mL conical tube using a tabletop centrifuge at 1,800× g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the parasite in 300 μL of Cytomix buffer supplemented with 0.2 M ATP and 0.5 M reduced L-glutathione (complete Cytomix). b. Pellet 50 μg of endonuclease-digested and ethanol-precipitated pLIC-TgPCNA1 2xNeonGreen-DHFR in the microcentrifuge at 15,000× g for 10 min. Aspirate and air dry the DNA pellet. Rehydrate the DNA pellet in 100 μL of parasite suspension in complete Cytomix and transfer the mixture into a 2 mm electroporation cuvette. c. Electroporate parasites with a single 1.7–1.8 kV/176–200 μs pulse using Amaxa Nucleofector II set on program T016. Immediately transfer parasites into a tachyzoite medium in a T-75 flask with a confluent HFF monolayer and recover them for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . d. Replace growth medium with pyrimethamine selection medium. Pass cultures 2–3 times in selection media until a stable drug-resistant population is established. e. Check the plasmid integration efficiency by live fluorescence microscopy of the polyclonal population. Infect HFF monolayers on coverslips with 10 3 tachyzoites under selection. After 24 h of growth in the tachyzoite medium, fix slides with 4% PFA (5 min, room temperature), incubate in IFA permeabilization buffer (10 min, room temperature), followed by IFA blocking buffer (30 min, room temperature), and stain with DAPI (nuclear dye). Visualize parasites expressing TgPCNA1 NG in a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope using ET-GFP block. f. Clone parasites by limiting dilution. Scrape HFF monolayers infected with a pyrimethamine-resistant population of tachyzoites, pass parasites through a G23 blunt-end needle, and separate from ruptured host cells using a 3 mm filter. Count parasites using a haemocytometer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Dilute the parasite suspension in the tachyzoite medium to a final concentration of 250/mL. Using an 8-channel pipette, perform serial 1:1 parasite dilutions in a 96-well plate to achieve a final concentration of 1–2 parasites per well. Grow cloned cultures at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 10 days to allow plaque development. g. Identify wells with individual plaques under an inverted light microscope (Nikon TMS-F). Expand clonal parasites by growing in 24-well and T-25 plates. h. Confirm live TgPCNA1 NG expression. Grow clonal parasites in the tachyzoite medium on glass coverslips for 18–20 h at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Fix slides with 4% PFA (5 min, room temperature), incubate in IFA permeabilization buffer (10 min, room temperature), and then incubate in the IFA blocking buffer (30 min, room temperature) and stain with DAPI (nuclear dye). Visualize parasites expressing TgPCNA1 NG in a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope using ET-GFP block. i. Confirm the plasmid integration in individual clones by PCR. Prepare a crude genomic DNA sample of individual clones. Pellet parental and transgenic clonal parasites from 100 μL of parasite suspension in the growth medium in 200 mL PCR tubes using a Minispin centrifuge for 5 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the parasites in 42 μL of PBS with 0.5 μL of Proteinase K solution, 2.5 μL of DMSO, and 5 μL of 5× HF-Phusion buffer. Incubate the reaction in the thermocycler at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by 50 °C for 2 h and 95 °C for 15 min. j. Prepare three diagnostic PCR primers. A forward Primer 1 is nested in the TgPCNA1 gene. A reverse Primer 2 is complementary to TgPCNA1 3’UTR. A reverse Primer 3 is complementary to the NeonGreen sequence. The combination of Primer 1 and Primer 2 amplifies a 1.3 kb locus of the native TgPCNA1 , while the combination of Primer 1 and Primer 3 will amplify a 1.1 kb locus of TgPCNA1 fused with NeonGreen . Note that published Toxo FUCCI S parasites carry TgPCNA1 NG as a second copy [10]. Primer 1: GAAGCCCAAGCCTTTTGCGAAT Primer 2: CGAAGGAAACCATCGATGCCA Primer 3: ACCATCGTTGGGGTTACCAGTAC k. Set up four PCR reactions. Test parental and transgenic parasite genomes using Primer 1/Primer 2 and Primer 1/Primer 3 combinations. The thermocycling conditions are as follows: one cycle of denaturation at 98 °C for 1 min; 32 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 25 s; and one cycle of extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Confirm DNA amplification by mixing 5 μL of PCR mixture with 2 μL of Orange G dye and resolving PCR products on a 0.8% agarose gel with a 1 kb+ DNA ladder. l. Confirm the TgPCNA1 NG protein expression in the transgenic clones by western blot using the anti-mNeonGreen antibody as previously described [10]. Expand and cryopreserve at least three clonal populations of RH TIR1 expressing TgPCNA1 NG protein for future use. B. Endogenous C-terminal tagging of TgBCC0 1. Retrieve the TgBCC0 genomic sequence (TGME49_294860) from ToxoDB database ( www.toxodb.org ). 2. Primer design and PCR amplification a. Use BCC0_For and BCC0_Rev primers to amplify the 3’end of TgBCC0 ORF. The forward primer includes a 5’LIC overhang for the vector annealing and TgBCC0- specific sequence. The 5’ end of the reverse primer includes LIC overhang for the vector annealing, followed by the last 24 nucleotides of TgBCC0 ORF, excluding the stop codon. Order the TgBCC0 tagging primers from IDT DNA ( www.idtdna.com ). BCC0_For: tacttccaatccaatttaatgcaaggtgctccaggaacagagag BCC0_Rev: tcctccacttccaattttagcgtaaaacgtcacttgtctccccag b. Amplify and purify a 2.4 kb TgBCC0 genomic fragment as described in step A2 using proper primer annealing temperature and PCR extension. 3. Cloning via Gibson assembly and transformation in E.coli a. Follow the steps described in step A3 and clone the TgBCC0 gene fragment into the pLIC-SM-3xmyc-CAT vector [10]. 4. Parasite transfection, cloning, and selection of clones a. Create an alternative Toxo FUCCI model in RH Tati Δku80 strain using the protocol described in section A [10,19]. b. Electroporate 50 mg of NsiI-linearized and ethanol-precipitated pLIC-TgBCC0-SM-3xmyc-CAT plasmid in the RH Tati Δku80 Toxo FUCCI tachyzoites following the procedure described in step A4. Select a chloramphenicol-resistant parasite population. Obtain and verify individual RH Tati Δku80 Toxo FUCCI clones expressing TgBCC0 myc by IFA, PCR, and western blot. C. Measurement of tachyzoite cell cycle phases 1. Use Toxo FUCCI S strain alone or expressing cell cycle markers or co-stained with antibodies against cell cycle markers to identify the individual cell cycle phases. In the absence of a reliable synchronization technique, the durations of the cell cycle phases can be determined using a combination of quantitative live and immunofluorescent microscopy ( Figure 1A ). The live TgPCNA1 NG fluorescence detects Toxo FUCCI S parasites actively replicating DNA [10]. Figure 1. Quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy (qIFA) approach to examine tachyzoite cell cycle. (A) A cartoon representation of the asynchronously growing tachyzoite vacuoles randomly distributed in the microscopic field on the left and organized according to the cell cycle phases on the right. The color represents a vacuole in a specific cell cycle stage. (B) A matrix designed to distinguish cell cycle phases based on the presence and the number of various mitotic structures (compartments). R: basal (MORN) ring. 2. Supplement Toxo FUCCI S live fluorescence with anti-Centrin antibody staining to quantify centrosomes [10,22,23]. 3. Use anti-MORN1 serum to visualize spindle morphology and basal rings [10–12,14,24]. 4. Use anti-TgIMC1 antibodies to identify tachyzoites undergoing cytokinesis (budding) [10,17,25]. Note: Tachyzoites maintain relative cell cycle synchrony within the vacuole. Yet, parasite populations are asynchronous, and the fraction of vacuoles in each cell cycle stage reflects the time parasites spend in each stage ( Figure 1A ). For example, the tachyzoite cell cycle is composed of ~50% G 1 , 30% S, and 20% of vacuoles undergoing overlapping mitosis (M) and budding (C, cytokinesis) [10,26,27]. Therefore, a random 100 vacuoles will represent a combination of ~50 vacuoles of parasites with a single centrosome (G 1 ), ~50 vacuoles of parasites with duplicated centrosomes (S + G 2 + M/C), of which ~15–20 vacuoles of parasites will have variable size buds (M/C), and ~10 vacuoles will have parasites with basal rings attached to a single or a duplicated centrocone (meta- and anaphases of mitosis) ( Figure 1B ). 5. Quantitative immunofluorescence a. Scrape infected HFF monolayers, pass three times through a G23 blunt-end needle, and separate freshly egressing parasites using a 3 mm filter ( Toxo FUCCI S strain or derivatives). Infect coverslips with confluent HFF monolayers with 10 3 filtered parasites. Important : Incubate for 15–20 min at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 and wash infected monolayers 2–3 times with Hank’s buffer to remove non-invaded parasites. Grow parasites at 34 °C with 5% CO 2 for 18 h. It allows parasites to complete two replication cycles. The resulting population primarily consists of cells at the optimal stage for cell cycle evaluation: vacuoles of four synchronously dividing parasites [10]. b. Perform IFA. Fix slides with 4% PFA (5 min, room temperature), incubate in IFA permeabilization buffer (10 min, room temperature), incubate in the IFA blocking buffer (30 min, room temperature), and stain with appropriate antibodies and DAPI (nuclear dye). Visualize TgPCNA1 NG in green, markers in red, and DAPI in blue channels using a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope. c. Important : Choose microscopic fields without bias. Count all parasites within each vacuole according to parameters defined in the experiment. Perform three biological replicates of each experiment. Use three people to do counts. 6. Cell cycle phase measurement a. G 1 phase : Quantify 500 random Toxo FUCCI S parasites and determine how many of them exhibit diffused nuclear TgPCNA NG staining and a single centrosome visualized with anti-Centrin antibodies ( Figure 2 , G 1 panel). b. S phase : Quantify 500 random Toxo FUCCI S parasites and determine how many of them exhibit aggregated nuclear TgPCNA NG staining that corresponds to the active replication foci ( Figure 2 , S-phase panel). c. S/C (budding) interval : Use a RH Tati Δku80 Toxo FUCCI line expressing one of the earliest markers of cytokinesis TgBCC0 myc [10]. Stain parasites with anti-myc antibodies. Quantify 500 parasites with aggregated nuclear TgPCNA NG (active DNA replication) and determine the fraction that also expresses TgBCC0 myc ( Figure 2 , S/C panel). d. S/M/C interval : Stain Toxo FUCCI S parasites with anti-TgMORN1 antibodies. The TgMORN1 localizes to the spindle compartment centrocone and basal complex, representing the parasite cytoskeleton. Quantify 500 parasites with aggregated nuclear TgPCNA NG (active DNA replication) and determine the fraction of the parasites that have a single centrocone with two MORN1 rings (basal complexes of the future buds), likely representing a prophase of the mitosis ( Figure 2 , S/M/C panel). e. M/C interval : Stain Toxo FUCCI S parasites with anti-TgIMC1 antibodies. Quantify 500 parasites with diffused nuclear and bright conoidal TgPCNA NG building TgIMC1 positive internal buds ( Figure 2 , M/C panel). i. To distinguish metaphase and anaphase, stain Toxo FUCCI S parasites with anti-TgMORN1 antibodies. Metaphase parasites have diffused nuclear and bright conoidal TgPCNA NG and a single centrocone associated with two MORN1 rings. Anaphase parasites have diffused nuclear and bright conoidal TgPCNA NG and a duplicated centrocone, each associated with a MORN1 ring. ii. To distinguish telophase, stain Toxo FUCCI S parasites with anti-TgIMC1 antibodies. Telophase parasites have two nuclei (use DAPI stain), bright conoidal TgPCNA NG , and two nearly mature internal buds within the recognizable mother cytoskeleton. Figure 2. Measurement of the tachyzoite cell cycle phases using Toxo FUCCIS strain. The upper panel shows T. gondii cell cycle organization. Cell cycle phases and their relative durations are indicated. The red stop signs mark three major checkpoints. The left vertical panel lists cell cycle phases or intervals and markers used to determine a phase duration or an overlap of the indicated phases. The main window shows cartoons of the tachyzoites undergoing cell cycle progression and depicts the phase of interest. The corresponding live/immunofluorescence microscopy images of the selected intervals are shown on the right. The percentage is the time that the tachyzoite spends in the indicated cell cycle frame. As a reference, the first panel shows all major morphological transitions of the tachyzoite, including the transition to the next division cycle (C/G1).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol was used to build the Toxo FUCCI S reporter system expressing the green fluorescent DNA replication factor TgPCNA1, as described in Batra et al. [10]. This transgenic line and its derivatives were instrumental in establishing the cell cycle organization of replicating T. gondii tachyzoites. Live-cell and immunofluorescent microscopy validated the Toxo FUCCI S probe. In addition, flow cytometry analysis confirmed the reproducibility of the Toxo FUCCI S signal distributed across the asynchronous population. Furthermore, the strain was capable of detecting cell cycle checkpoints, including TgCrk6-mediated spindle assembly checkpoint and TgCrk4-regulated G 2 /M transition [11,14].",

    "title": "Campylobacter jejuni Biofilm Assessment by NanoLuc Luciferase Assay.",
    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni, a widespread pathogen found in birds and mammals, poses a significant risk for zoonosis worldwide despite its susceptibility to environmental and food-processing stressors. One of its main survival mechanisms is the formation of biofilms that can withstand various food-processing stressors, which is why efficient methods for assessing biofilms are crucial. Existing methods, including the classical culture-based plate counting method, biomass-staining methods (e.g., crystal violet and safranin), DNA-staining methods, those that use metabolic substrates to detect live bacteria (e.g., tetrazolium salts and resazurin), immunofluorescence with flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy, and PCR-based methods for quantification of bacterial DNA, are diverse but often lack specificity, sensitivity, and suitability. In response to these limitations, we propose an innovative approach using NanoLuc as a reporter protein. The established protocol involves growing biofilms in microtiter plates, washing unattached cells, adding Nano-Glo luciferase substrate, and measuring bioluminescence. The bacterial concentrations in the biofilms are calculated by linear regression based on the calibration curve generated with known cell concentrations. The NanoLuc protein offers a number of advantages, such as its small size, temperature stability, and highly efficient bioluminescence, enabling rapid, non-invasive, and comprehensive assessment of biofilms together with quantification of a wide range of cell states. Although this method is limited to laboratory use due to the involvement of genetically modified organisms, it provides valuable insights into C. jejuni biofilm dynamics that could indirectly help in the development of improved food safety measures. Key features • Quantification of C. jejuni using NanoLuc luciferase. • The assay is linear in the range of 1.9 × 107 to 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL. • Following biofilm growth, less than 1 h is required for detection. • The assay requires genetically modified bacterial strains.",

Inoculation loops (Golias, catalog number: EZ08)\n\nProcedure A. Reviving glycerol stock of C. jejuni 1. Remove a vial containing a stock culture of C. jejuni , previously transformed with the pMW10_nLuc plasmid via triparental mating [22], from -80 °C and place it on ice. For handling C. jejuni , see General note 1. 2. Using a sterile loop, aseptically transfer half a loop of culture to Karmali-selective plates and incubate the plates at 42 °C under microaerophilic conditions (85% N 2 , 10% CO 2 , and 5% O 2 ) for 24 h. Microaerophilic conditions are ensured by blowing the gas mixture into an airtight box, which is then placed in the incubator. 3. Using a cotton swab, respread the colonies grown on Karmali agar to MHA agar containing 30 μg/mL of kanamycin. Incubate the plate at 42 °C under microaerophilic conditions for 24 h. B. Overnight culture for calibration curve preparation 1. Prepare 15 mL of MHB medium with 30 μg/mL of kanamycin in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. 2. Using a sterile inoculation loop, inoculate a few colonies from the MHA agar plate into the medium prepared above. Vortex the tubes. 3. Incubate at 42 °C under microaerophilic conditions (85% N 2 , 10% CO 2 , and 5% O 2 ) with gentle shaking (80 rpm) for 16–20 h. C. Establishing biofilms in microtiter plates 1. Using a sterile loop, take a few colonies from the MHA agar plate and resuspend them in MHB medium until they reach OD 600 = 0.1 (approximately 10 7 CFU/mL, see General note 2). 2. Transfer 100 μL of this suspension into 9.9 mL of MHB medium to achieve a final concentration of approximately 10 CFU/mL. This will serve as the initial culture. 3. Pipette 200 μL of the initial culture to each well, using three separately prepared samples (biological replicates) with each biological replicate in three wells (technical replicates). This results in nine wells per condition. Cover the plates with sterile microplate sealing tape. 4. Incubate the plates under microaerophilic conditions (85% N 2 , 10% CO 2 , and 5% O 2 ) for different time periods (e.g., 4, 8, 24, 48, or 72 h). 5. After incubation, carefully rinse the biofilms in the microtiter plates three times with 100 μL of PBS. After the last wash, add 50 μL of PBS to each well. Proceed with bioluminescence measurements as described in section D. Thaw the Nano-Glo luciferase buffer (from Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System) and gently mix the Nano-Glo luciferase substrate by pipetting. Allow both the reagents and the cultures in the microtiter plates to equilibrate to room temperature before proceeding with the experiment. D. Calibration curve preparation 1. Adjust the overnight culture (prepared in section B) using sterile MHB medium to obtain an OD 600 corresponding to 1.50 × 10 8 CFU/mL (see General note 2). This will be the bacterial output suspension for the calibration curve. 2. Prepare five distinct dilutions (0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1) in 1.5 mL tubes to create a calibration curve using the prepared bacterial output suspension (1.50 × 10 8 CFU/mL) as the starting concentration (1.0 or 100%). Prepare each dilution by adding the appropriate volumes of bacterial suspension and sterile growth medium, e.g., tube 0.8: mix 800 μL of bacterial suspension with 200 μL of sterile growth medium, etc. 3. Transfer 50 μL of dilutions to the unused wells of the microtiter plate with biofilms in duplicate. 4. Use sterile MHB medium as a blank, which is placed in three wells. The mean value is subtracted from each measurement. E. Bioluminescence measurement 1. Thaw the Nano-Glo luciferase buffer and gently mix the Nano-Glo luciferase substrate by pipetting. Allow both the reagents and the cultures in the microtiter plates to equilibrate to room temperature before proceeding with the experiment. 2. Prepare the appropriate amount of substrate by mixing one volume (e.g., 100 μL) of Nano-Glo luciferase assay substrate with 50 volumes (e.g., 5 mL) of Nano-Glo luciferase assay buffer. 3. Quickly add 50 μL of substrate to each well containing the culture and wait 3 min. Then, measure bioluminescence using the plate reader (e.g., Omega FLUOstar) (settings: luminescence mode; integration time, 1 s; settle time, 150 ms). F. Calculating the concentration of bacteria in biofilms 1. Use Excel to plot the calibration curve with relative light units on the y-axis and CFU/mL on the x-axis. A representative calibration curve is shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2. Representative calibration curve of the Campylobacter jejuni biofilm assay. RLU, relative light units; CFU/mL, colony-forming units per mL. 2. Use linear regression (Excel functions: slope and intercept) to calculate biofilm cell concentrations from measured bioluminescence (see General note 3).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol was validated in Čukajne et al.

    "title": "Host Receptor Pili for Cryo-EM Single-Particle Reconstruction.",
    "abstract": "Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) infect their hosts by binding to the host receptor pili. Purification of pili usually involves mechanical shearing of pili from cells followed by precipitation. However, previous methods often result in low efficiency or unstable results due to pili retraction. This protocol presents an optimized method for purifying receptor type IV pili from Acinetobacter genomospecies 16 (A. gp16), incorporating enhancements in shearing and collection steps to achieve high yields. We found that repeated passage through syringe needles increases yield, and temperature control is crucial during purification. Additionally, the CsCl density gradient was optimized specifically for this specific strain. The purified type IV pili are suitable for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and various biochemical experiments. Key features • Pili purification for single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) analysis • This protocol builds upon the F-pili purification method developed by Costa et al. [1] extending its application to the Acinetobacter genomosp. 16. • It is optimized for higher and more stable pili yields, as well as increased reproducibility. • The method is tested on various bacterial species and can be adapted to purify different types of pili.",

Using a sterile inoculation loop, obtain a small amount of bacteria from the thawed stock. Streak the loop across the surface of an LB agar plate using the quadrant streak method to gradually dilute the bacterial concentration. Incubate the plate at 30 °C overnight to allow colony formation. After incubation, select well-isolated single colonies for further analysis or experimentation ( Figure 1A ). Figure 1. Host bacteria culture, collection, and pili shearing. (A) Pipeline for host bacteria inoculation and culture. (B) Pipeline for pili collection. L-shaped spreaders are used to gently scrape cells from the surface of the plate. The collected bacterial cell suspension is then passed through a syringe to further remove the pili, followed by vortexing. Day 2 afternoon Prepare 100 LB agar plates without antibiotics (for use on Day 3). Pick a single colony and inoculate it into 3 mL of LB medium for overnight shaking at 30 °C. Day 3 In the morning (7 AM), take 100 µL from the 3 mL overnight culture and inoculate into 30 mL of LB medium. Incubate this A. gp16 cell culture with shaking at 200 rpm at 30 °C until the culture reaches OD 600 = 0.1. Note: For different strains, the target OD 600 may vary. For example, for E. coli, OD 600 = 0.6 is typical . Add 100 µL of culture to each of the 100 prepared agar plates and spread evenly using a cell spreader. Option 1: 100 plates. Most are for large-scale purification. Option 2: 30 plates. For A. gp16 type IV pili, a smaller scale can also yield satisfactory results. Option 3: Six large (25 cm × 25 cm) LB medium plates. This requires increasing the inoculum to 1 mL per plate. These larger plates reduce preparation time and simplify the procedure. Incubate the plates at 30 °C for 30 min to allow the surface to dry slightly. For overnight incubation, the plates should be inverted (bottom up, lid down) to prevent accumulated humidity from dripping onto the surface, which could affect pili formation. (Overnight incubation typically takes about 16 h. Deviating from this time frame may impact pili yield.) (Option 1) Host bacteria collection Day 4 Pre-chill the dialysis buffer (1 L) at 4 °C. Take out the overnight plates from 30 °C and immediately place them on ice. Process five plates at a time to prevent pili retraction at room temperature. Collect the bacterial cells from the plates using 300 µL of dialysis buffer with an L-shaped spreader, then collect the liquid from the plate surface using a 1 mL pipette into a 50 mL Falcon tube. Note: For 25 cm × 25 cm plates, use approximately 8 mL of dialysis buffer ( Figure 1B ) . Pili shearing and precipitation Day 4 Pass the bacterial suspension through needles three times to shear the pili. Begin with the 18 G needle and then pass through the 25 G needle twice. Note: Thinner needles help shear the pili but may clog. Repeat the shearing process iteratively for all plates, processing 5–10 plates at a time. After shearing, vortex the liquid for 30 s ( Figure 1B ). Centrifuge the cell solution at 3,470× g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the cells. Note: If the solution remains unclear, repeat the centrifugation. Higher speeds (4,000–8,000× g) can also be used as long as the cells are adequately spun down. Collect the pili from the supernatant using a pipette. If starting with 30 plates, concentrate the pili solution to 2–3 mL using centrifugation. For larger volume purification (100 plates), concentrate the pili solution to 8–10 mL. (Option 2) For high-yield pili, such as A. gp16 , this method is unnecessary. Sections B2 and C2 below can be used as an alternative method for pili purification of other low-yield species. It involves more steps and is relatively complicated. Refer to the general notes section for detailed explanations. B2. Host bacteria collection (generalized method for all other kinds of pili purification) Day 4 Pre-chill the SSC buffer at 4 °C. Place the overnight plates on ice, processing five plates at a time to prevent pili retraction at room temperature. Collect the bacterial cells from the plates using 500 µL of SSC buffer and an L-shaped spreader. Then, collect the liquid from the plate surface using a 1 mL pipette. For 25 cm × 25 cm plates, typically use 8 mL of SSC buffer. Slightly more buffer can be used in this step. C2. Pili shearing and precipitation (generalized method for all other kinds of pili purification) Day 4 Pass the bacterial suspension through needles three times to shear the pili. Begin with the 18 G needle first and then pass through the 25 G needle twice. Note: Thinner needles help shear the pili but may clog. Repeat the shearing process iteratively for all plates, processing 5–10 plates at a time, and vortex the liquid for 30 s. After collecting all the plates, adjust the total volume of the solution to 1 L by adding pre-chilled SSC buffer. Incubate the liquid suspension at 4 °C for 2 h and stir gently. Centrifuge the cell solution at 8,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any remaining cells. Centrifuge twice to make sure cells are removed, and then collect the supernatant using a pipette. As the pili are present in large volumes, precipitate the supernatant by adding 5% PEG6000 (diluted from 50% PEG) and 500 mM NaCl. After 4 h of incubation at 4 °C, collect the precipitate by centrifuging the suspension at 15,000× g for 40–50 min, twice. At this stage, resuspend the purified pili pellet in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 (F pilus). Dialysis the 2 mL pili samples using dialysis buffer overnight. Pili purification and dialysis Days 5 and 6 CsCl step gradient setup: The purification steps need CsCl step gradients of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 g/cm 3 (4 mL, 3 mL, and 3 mL, respectively). If the band is formed high in the tube, consider adding 1.4 g/cm 3 for 0.5 mL and reducing 1.3 g/cm 3 to 2.5 mL. When loading the CsCl gradient, ensure the needle reaches the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Different density layers are loaded onto the tube one by one. Begin by loading the low-density gradient, followed by the middle-density gradient, and finally the highest-density gradient. The needle should always reach the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Gently depress the syringe plunger to allow the lighter gradients to rise smoothly. Finally, load around 1.5 mL of the pili sample onto the top of the gradient solution ( Figure 2A ). Figure 2. CsCl gradient preparation, sample loading, and sample collection. (A) CsCl gradient preparation. When loading the CsCl gradient, ensure the needle reaches the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Begin by loading the low-density gradient, followed by the middle-density gradient, and finally the highest-density gradient. The needle should always reach the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Gently depress the syringe plunger to allow the lighter gradients to rise smoothly. The pili sample is loaded onto the top of the gradient solution in the final step. (B) When extracting the bands, remove the bottom band first to avoid disturbing the gradients above it. Centrifuge the sample at 19,200× g for 19 h at 4 °C using SW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor. Ensure proper tube balance before starting centrifugation. Note: For A. gp16, there will be two bands formed within the tube—the top band represents curved, thin pili, while the bottom band is composed of straight, thicker pili, which is the type IV pili. This is verified by the ssRNA phage as an antibody as well as mass spec. For F-pili, only one band forms in the tube, as strain MC4100 cells produce only one type of pili. Use a syringe with a 23 G needle to extract the pili band from the tube. Note: We prefer the 23 G needle because it is thin enough to precisely extract a single band while being sufficiently rigid to puncture the side of the centrifuge tube ( Figure 2B ) . Carefully remove the pili band and extensively dialyze it against the dialysis buffer using a dialysis cassette. Perform initial dialysis for 4 h in 1 L of buffer, followed by overnight dialysis in 2 L of fresh buffer, and finally another 4 h of dialysis in 2 L of buffer. Confirm the presence of pili using SDS-PAGE and verify their identity using LC-ESI MS/MS. Two types of pili are present in A. gp16 . The presence and purity of type IV pili are confirmed by negative-stain electron microscopy. Note: We used 4%–20% acrylamide gradient gels.\n\nValidation of protocol The purification method described in this protocol has been validated in two cryo-EM structure papers published in Nature Communications [7,12]. In Figure 3A , we present bands formed during two different pili purification batches. The “Pili Only” tube (right) illustrates typical results after type IV pili purification, where Layer 1 contains curved, thin FilA pili and Layer 2 contains straight, thick type IV pili. Cryo-EM analysis ( Figure 3C and 3D ) confirmed the purity of these layers. In A. gp16 cells, there are more curved, thin FilA pili than the straight, thick type IV pili outside cell boundaries. This is why in the final image, curved, thin pili showed relatively higher concentration. In Figure 3A , the “Pili-Phage” tube (left) demonstrates an experiment where phage was premixed with the pili solution before the CsCl step. The phage with RNA of higher density appears in Layer 3 as a reference. The image shown in Figure 3B shows the phage and host receptor adsorption of purified pili from Layer 1 and Layer 2. (Purified AP205 phage was added into a mixture of pili from layer 1 and layer 2.) The red arrow points to straight, thick type IV pili with phage, while the blue arrow indicates curved, thin pili, which do not act as host receptors and show no phage adsorption. The scale bar represents a length of 500 A. For mass spec and cryo-EM results for layers 1 and 2 please see the published paper’s supplementary section [7]. Figure 3. Validation of purified samples using EM. (A) Sample bands formed during two different purifications. The “Pili Only” tube (right) shows results after type IV pili purification, with the top band (Layer 1) containing curved, thin FilA pili, and the bottom band (Layer 2) containing straight, thicker type IV pili. The “Pili-Phage” tube (left) demonstrates an experiment where phage was premixed with the pili solution. The phage, containing RNA of higher density, appears in Layer 3 as a reference.

    "title": "Acutely Modifying Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates on Endolysosomes Using Chemically Inducible Dimerization Systems.",
    "abstract": "Phosphoinositides are rare membrane lipids that mediate cell signaling and membrane dynamics. PI(4)P and PI(3)P are two major phosphoinositides crucial for endolysosomal functions and dynamics, making them the lipids of interest in many studies. The acute modulation of phosphoinositides at a given organelle membrane can reveal important insights into their cellular function. Indeed, the localized depletion of PI(4)P and PI(3)P is a viable tool to assess the importance of these phosphoinositides in various experimental conditions. Here, we describe a live imaging method to acutely deplete PI(4)P and PI(3)P on endolysosomes. The depletion assay utilizes the GAI-GID1 or the FRB-FKBP inducible dimerization system to target the catalytic domain of the PI(4)P phosphatase, Sac1, or the PI(3)P phosphatase domain of MTM1 to the endolysosome for localized depletion of these phosphoinositides. By using the fluorescently tagged biosensors, 2xP4M and PX, we can validate and monitor the depletion of PI(4)P and PI(3)P, respectively, on endolysosomes in real-time. We discuss a method for normalizing the fluorescence measurements to appropriate the relative amount of these phosphoinositides in the organellar membranes (endolysosomes), which is required for monitoring PI(4)P or PI(3)P levels during the acute depletion assay. Since the localization of the dimerization partners is specified by the membrane targeting signal, our protocol will be useful for studying the signaling and functions of phosphoinositides at any membrane. Key features • Acute depletion and real-time monitoring of PI(3)P and PI(4)P on the endolysosomal membrane using chemically inducible dimerization systems. • Modifiable and adaptable to modulate other phosphoinositides on different organellar membranes.",

Therefore, we recommend electroporation methods such as the Neon electroporation system (Invitrogen) for these assays. The use of antibiotics and antimycotics should be avoided as it affects cell viability after electroporation. Culture HeLa cells in T75 cm 2 flasks in DMEM containing 10% FBS ( complete media ) until cells reach 70%–80% confluency. Remove media and wash with D-PBS. Add 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA per flask and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C or until cells are detached. Add 8 mL of complete media to stop trypsin activity. Place a clean cover glass on top of the hemocytometer (counting chamber facing up). Transfer 10 µL of the cell suspension into the counting chamber by capillary action and view under a standard inverted light microscope. The hemocytometer chamber is composed of nine large, gridded squares, each containing 0.1 mm 3 space (= 0.1 µL). Count the cells in every gridded square and average them. Estimate the cell density by dividing the average number of cells per gridded square by 1 mm 3 or 0.1 µL. Transfer 0.5 × 10 6 cells to a new 15 mL conical tube per transfection. Spin cells at 300× g for 5 min, remove supernatant, and resuspend with 10 mL of D-PBS. Spin at 300× g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 µL of Neon electroporation R buffer and transfer to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add DNA (dissolved in water or Tris-EDTA elution buffer) to cells. The manufacturer recommends adding 5 µg of total DNA per 100 µL of cells resuspended in R buffer. The DNA amount is plasmid-dependent and may require optimization. For PI(4)P depletion using the GAI-GID1 system: An equal amount of iRFP-GID1-Rab7 + CFP-GAI-Sac1 or CFP-GAI-Sac1 C392S (catalytically dead Sac1 used as a negative control). Co-transfection with an equal amount of PI(4)P biosensor mCherry-2xP4M to assess PI(4)P depletion or Lamp1-mCherry to assess the effect of PI(4)P depletion on endolysosomal morphology. For PI(3)P depletion using the FKBP-FRB dimerization system: An equal amount of iRFP-FRB-Rab7 + mCherry-FKBP-MTM1 or mCherry-FKBP (used as a negative control). Co-transfection with an equal amount of PI(3)P biosensor PX-GFP to monitor for PI(3)P depletion or Lamp1-GFP to assess the effect of PI(3)P depletion on endolysosomes. Fill the electroporation tube with 3 mL of buffer E2. Insert the tube into the tube chamber. Ensure that the electroporation parameters are customized according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( https://www.thermofisher.com/ca/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html ). For HeLa cells, set the pulse number to 2, voltage at 1,005 V, and width at 35 ms. Start the electroporation. Dilute the electroporated cell suspension with 2.4 mL of warm complete media. Seed 0.5 mL of the diluted cell suspension (equivalent to 0.1 × 10 6 cells) per cell chamber (Lab-tek II chambered cover glass, 1.7 cm 2 per well). Incubate the cell chamber in the tissue culture CO 2 incubator for 12–36 h for plasmid expression. Imaging and dimerization Perform live microscopy imaging 24 h post-electroporation. On the day of imaging, prepare an aliquot of complete media supplemented with either 20 µM GA 3 -AM or 200 nM rapamycin (2× concentration, to a final concentration of 10 µM GA 3 -AM or 100 nM rapamycin). For each condition, prepare 300 µL of solutions (sufficient to cover a 1.7 cm 2 cell chamber). This protocol uses the Zeiss Airyscan 2 LSM 980 inverted microscope with Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 oil objective at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 -controlled imaging chamber. Before imaging, ensure the appropriate lasers and filters setup according to the wavelengths (λ) of the excitation (Ex)/emission (Em) maxima of the fluorescent proteins listed in Table 2 . Furthermore, ensure that the stage temperature is stable. Table 2.

Similar lasers and filters can be used on other systems. Replace each cell chamber with 300 µL of fresh complete media. Secure the cell chamber slide on the stage with the appropriate adaptor. Using ZEN microscopy software, add “time series” and “Z-stacks” to the acquisition parameters to record stacks of time-lapse images. Dimerization should occur within 10 min after adding the inducing agents (GA 3 -AM or rapamycin). We suggest capturing a 10-min video with an interval of 1 min for kinetic assays. For end-point assays, capture images up to 1 h after induction. For kinetic assays, move the stage to a field of monolayer cells and start the acquisition using the parameters as described in step 5. After acquiring the first stacks, wait for 30 s and carefully pipette an equal volume (300 µL) of the solution prepared from step B1 into the cell chamber well (the final volume is now 600 µL). The acquisition should continue automatically as preconfigured in the software. For end-point assays, image the cells before induction. Then, add an equal volume of the solution and incubate for at least 10 min and up to 1 h followed by another round of post-induction imaging.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article(s): Boutry et al.

    "title": "Immunofluorescence for Detection of TOR Kinase Activity In Situ in Photosynthetic Organisms.",
    "abstract": "The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a central hub kinase that promotes growth and development in all eukaryote cells. TOR induces protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of the S6 kinase (S6K), which, in turn, phosphorylates ribosomal S6 protein (RPS6) increasing this anabolic process. Therefore, S6K and RPS6 phosphorylation are generally used as readouts of TOR activity. Protein phosphorylation levels are measured by a western blot (WB) technique using an antibody against one specific phosphosite in cell extracts. However, at the tissue/cell-specific level, there is a huge gap in plants due to the lack of alternative techniques for the evaluation of TOR activity as there are for other organisms such as mammals. Here, we describe an in vivo protocol to detect S6K phosphorylation in tissues/cells of model photosynthetic organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our proposed method consists of the immunolocalization of a phosphorylated target of TOR kinase using a fluorescent secondary antibody by confocal microscopy. The protocol involves four main steps: tissue/cell fixation, permeabilization, and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. It is an easy technique that allows handling different samples at the same time. In addition, different ultrastructural cell markers can also be used, such as for nucleus and cell wall detection, allowing a detailed analysis of cell morphology. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol to detect TOR activity in situ in photosynthetic organisms; we consider that it will pave the research on the TOR kinase, opening new possibilities to better understand its complex signaling. Key features • The protocol is an easy and non-destructive method to detect S6K phosphorylation at the cellular level for plants and algae. • First method for in situ immunolocalization of target proteins of TOR kinase in photosynthetic organisms.",

Add 20 mL of 5× PBS. Check pH; it should be between 7.2 and 7.8. Bring up to 100 mL with ddH 2 O. Split into Falcon tubes and store at -20 °C for up to 3 months and protected from light. Caution: Highly toxic. Wear protective gloves and work in the fume hood when handling the powder. PBS (5×) (for 1 L) Dissolve 3.62 g of Na 2 HPO 4 (FW 141.96), 1.05 g of KH 2 PO 4 (FW 136.1), and 38.25 g of NaCl (FW 58.44) in 800 mL of ddH 2 O. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with H 3 PO 4 and then add ddH 2 O to the final volume. Dispense the solution into aliquots and sterilize them by autoclaving. The work solution used is 1× (final concentration 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , and 140 mM NaCl). Permeabilization and blocking buffer (PB) (for 1.5 mL of PB) Add 150 μL of 1% BSA, 45 μL of 10% Triton X-100, and 1,305 μL of 1× PBS (final concentration 1× PBS, 0.1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton X-100).\n\nProcedure Tissue fixation (duration 4–6 h) Remove Arabidopsis or Chlamydomonas samples from the growth medium and wash with 1× PBS. Add 200 μL of 4% PFA to each tube (must cover the biological material). Sample incubation For algae: Incubate for 6 h at 4 °C. For plant: Cut the root, place it in a microcentrifuge tube, and incubate the tissue in a vacuum desiccator for 6 h at room temperature (approximately 20 °C) to ensure proper tissue penetration. Note: Leaves could also be used for the analysis (after removal of chlorophyll and other pigments). Permeabilization and blocking (duration 24 h) Remove the PFA solution and wash the material with 1× PBS at RT. Add ~70 μL of PB to each tube (must cover the biological material) and incubate for 24 h at 4 °C. Primary antibody incubation (duration 4 d) Remove PB from all tubes (except the negative control, in which you should change the PB solution). Add the antibody at a dilution of 1/50 in PB to a final volume of 50 μL per tube (except the negative control, in which you should change the PB solution). Incubate for 4 days at 4 °C (move the solution every 1 or 2 days). Wash the material with 1× PBS (wash, remove, and add back). Incubate for 24 h at 4 °C. Note: In the case of plants, primary antibody can be recovered for another use. Secondary antibody incubation (duration 2 d) Remove the PBS solution. Add the anti-IgG-Alexa 488 antibody at a dilution of 1/250 in PB to a final volume of 50 μL per tube. Incubate for 24 h at 4 °C. Wash the material with 1× PBS (wash, remove, and add back). Incubate for 24 h at 4 °C. Note: Always protect the samples from light. Nucleus staining (optional) Nucleus labeling can be useful to localize the protein of interest at subcellular, cellular, and tissue level. For propidium iodide (PI) staining: Remove the PBS solution. Add PI fluorophore to the samples at a dilution of 1/1,000 in 1× PBS to a final volume of 50 μL per tube (protect from light). Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Wash the material four times with 1× PBS (wash, remove, and add back). Analyze under a confocal microscope. For DAPI staining: Remove the PBS solution. Add DAPI fluorophore to the samples at a dilution of 1/1,000 in 1× PBS to a final volume of 50 μL per tube (protect from light). Incubate for 30 min for Arabidopsis or 5 min for Chlamydomonas at room temperature. Wash the material three times with 1× PBS (wash, remove, and add back). Analyze under a confocal microscope.\n\nValidation of protocol To validate the observed fluorescence pattern of the protein under study, each immunolocalization experiment must include the correct controls. In our case, we used an ATP-competitive TOR inhibitor (AZD-8055 Cayman, catalog number: 16978) to evaluate the specificity of the protocol. The AZD treatment considerably reduced the fluorescence intensity in both Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas samples, corroborating that the signal detected is specifically due to the TOR activity ( Figures 1B , 2B , and 3B). Besides, a sample without the addition of the primary antibody was used to determine the amount of background signal caused by the secondary antibody ( Figures 1C , 2C , and 3C). This negative control did not show fluorescence, demonstrating that the technique has a low background. We also corroborated this methodology in other plant tissues such as lateral and hair roots (Figures S1 and S2).",

    "title": "Real-Time Autophagic Flux Measurements in Live Cells Using a Novel Fluorescent Marker DAPRed.",
    "abstract": "Autophagy is a conserved homeostatic mechanism involved in cellular homeostasis and many disease processes. Although it was first described in yeast cells undergoing starvation, we have learned over the years that autophagy gets activated in many stress conditions and during development and aging in mammalian cells. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying autophagy effects can bring us closer to better insights into the pathogenesis of many disease conditions (e.g., cardiac muscle necrosis, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic lung injury). Due to the complex and dynamic nature of the autophagic processes, many different techniques (e.g., western blotting, fluorescent labeling, and genetic modifications of key autophagy proteins) have been developed to delineate autophagy effects. Although these methods are valid, they are not well suited for the assessment of time-dependent autophagy kinetics. Here, we describe a novel approach: the use of DAPRed for autophagic flux measurement via live cell imaging, utilizing A549 cells, that can visualize and quantify autophagic flux in real time in single live cells. This approach is relatively straightforward in comparison to other experimental procedures and should be applicable to any in vitro cell/tissue models. Key features • Allows real-time qualitative imaging of autophagic flux at single-cell level. • Primary cells and cell lines can also be utilized with this technique. • Use of confocal microscopy allows visualization of autophagy without disturbing cellular functions.",

Freshly prepare chloroquine [water soluble; vehicle: culture fluid (MDS) (see\nRecipes)], an inhibitor of autophagosome fusion with lysosome (stock\nsolution: 40 mM), and add to the culture fluid to reach 40 μM final\nconcentration on both apical and basolateral sides for 1 h before imaging;\nthe control should receive culture fluid alone. Note: Live cell imaging is carried out with and without chloroquine\nwith different sets of cells. Add DAPRed [0.1 μM; lipid soluble; vehicle: 0.1% (v/v) DMSO] (1 μL) to\nthe culture fluid in the apical compartment for 30 min before imaging. To label cell plasma membranes, remove culture fluid and apply Dylight\n488-conjugated tomato lectin (5 μg/mL: 5 μL from stock of 1 mg/mL)\ndirectly onto the apical surface of the cells just prior to imaging. Note: Although Dylight 488 proved to be resistant to photobleaching\nin our hands, it is advisable to avoid unnecessary light exposure. Carefully cut out the Transwell filter with the cell monolayer of interest\ngrown on it using a scalpel along the rim. Mount the Transwell filter with\nmonolayer on a coverslip and add Krebs-Ringer solution (~1–2 mL), as a\nbathing solution, to the coverslip chamber. Live cell imaging: Perform confocal imaging at 63× magnification, 12 bit, and\n1,024 × 1,024 resolution with an SP8 confocal microscope\nsystem. In xyz series, measure intracellular fluorescence intensity (DAPRed:\n561/570–600 nm, Dylight 488-conjugated tomato lectin:\n488/490–530 nm) stack by stack over the entire volume of a\nsingle, live A549 cell. Aim to zoom in sufficiently to get to the level of ~150–200\nnm/pixel, which is the resolution limit of current confocal\nmicroscopy approaches, and to include as many cells as possible. Using the signal of Dylight 488-conjugated tomato lectin, set the\nupper limit for xyz series. For a typical A549 cell, this is 60\n× 60 × 20 μm for x, y, and z dimensions,\nrespectively. Move the objective in the opposite direction to find the lower limit\nfor xyz series (i.e., where the fluorescence signal is lost) and set\nthe sectioning interval between 0.35 and 0.5 μm. This seems to be\nthe most practical interval to produce detailed 3D image quality of\nautophagosomes in live A549 cells while avoiding phototoxicity and\nphotobleaching caused by more aggressive laser scanning.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research\narticle(s): Sipos, A., Kim, K.

    "title": "Protocol for Imaging the Same Class IV Neurons at Different Stages of Development.",
    "abstract": "In this protocol, we focused on analyzing internal branches of Drosophila class IV neurons. These neurons are characterized by their highly branched axons and dendrites and intricately tile the larval body. As Drosophila larvae progress through developmental stages, the dendritic arbors of Class IV neurons undergo notable transformations. As Drosophila larvae develop, their Class IV dendritic arbors grow. In the initial 24 h after egg laying (AEL), the dendrites are smaller than segments. During the subsequent 24 h of the first instar larval stage, dendritic arbors outpace segment growth, achieving tiling. After 48 h, arbors and segments grow concurrently. Epidermal cells near Class IV dendrites expand in proportion to segment growth. This observation suggested that Class IV cells might grow via branch dilation-uniformly elongating branches, akin to Class I cells [1,2]. To understand whether the class IV complex arbor structure is formed by dilation or simply from growing tips, we developed this protocol to introduce a systematic approach for quantitatively assessing the growth dynamics of internal branches. Key features • This protocol employs imaging the same neuron over different development times • Drosophila embryo and larvae genotype is ;;ppkCD4-tdGFP, which explicitly tags class IV neurons • This protocol for the preparation of agar pads to mount and image Drosophila larvae is adapted from Monica Driscoll's method • Neurons are imaged without the use of anesthetics and for a short duration of time • This technique involves the use of a spinning disk confocal microscope.",

Preparing an agar pad for larvae imaging Measure and dissolve agar in water to create a 5% agar solution. Utilize a heat block to maintain the solution's molten state at a steady 65 °C. This temperature ensures the agar remains in a liquid state for the subsequent steps. Application of agar solution: Using scissors, cut the tip of a 1000 mL pipette to allow controlled dispensing. Pipette 100–200 mL of molten agar onto the center of a pristine glass slide, ensuring a smooth and even distribution. Formation of the agar pad: Place another clean glass slide perpendicular to the one with the agar drop, creating a \"sandwich\" effect. Gently press the top slide to flatten the agar, forming a circular pad. Pay close attention to avoid trapping air bubbles within the agar during this process, as they can interfere with imaging. Optimal technique: For a more precise agar pad suitable for imaging larvae, follow Monica Driscoll's method. This technique involves using two additional taped slides, ensuring a flat surface without any irregularities that might hinder the larvae's movement or positioning. Solidification and separation: Allow the agar to solidify naturally. Carefully separate the slides, ensuring that the agar pad adheres to one of them without any damage or distortion. Timely preparation: It is crucial to prepare the agar pad just before use to maintain its optimal consistency and prevent it from drying out, which could affect its efficacy as a base for imaging. Halocarbon application: Before mounting the larvae for imaging, add a drop of Halocarbon 700 onto the agar pad. Spread the halocarbon evenly across the surface to ensure proper lubrication and facilitate smooth movement of the larvae during imaging. Chilling for optimal performance: To further enhance the agar pad's performance, chill it at 4 °C for approximately 5 min before mounting the larvae. This step can assist in achieving better adherence and stability. Mounting of live larvae Preparation of larvae: Wash the larvae sequentially with 20% and then 5% sucrose solutions to ensure cleanliness and hydration. Positioning on agar bed: Gently place the larvae, dorsal side up, onto a 5% agar bed secured on a glass slide. Create an imaging environment by adding a drop composed of 50% PBS and 50% Halocarbon oil 700. Immobilization technique: Further immobilize the larvae by applying gentle pressure with a 22 × 22 mm coverslip lined with Vaseline or vacuum grease. Temperature optimization: Allow the setup to rest at 4 °C for 5 min to enhance stability. Optional temperature control for reduced movement: Optionally, minimize larval movement during imaging by maintaining a temperature of 4 °C for 2–5 min. Employ an OKO lab temperature control module connected to a spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon) for this purpose. Image acquisition: Samples were imaged using a sophisticated spinning disk microscope setup, incorporating a Yokogawa CSU-W1 disk with a 50 μm pinhole size. The agar pad setup was mounted on a fully automated Nikon TI inverted microscope, equipped with perfect focus capabilities. For illumination, a 488 nm laser was used at a power setting of 18%–21%. The imaging was performed using either a 40× water immersion objective or a 20× air objective. The detection system included an sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2 plus) and was controlled using Nikon Elements software. Prior to image acquisition, samples were manually focused to accurately identify the abdominal third and fourth segments (A3 or A4 neurons). Static images intended for morphometric studies were captured using the 40× water immersion objective for larvae that were 24 h AEL, while the 20× objective was utilized for imaging larvae at later stages (such as 48, 72, and 96 h AEL). To create comprehensive images, the individual images were stitched together using the stitching plugin available in ImageJ software [6]. Post-imaging procedure: Return the imaged larvae to an apple agar plate containing yeast paste within a Darwin chamber set at 25 °C. Conduct a subsequent imaging session after 24 h, allowing for the continuous observation of the same class IV neuron throughout larvae development without the use of an anesthetic. Protocol for stitching microscope images using FIJI plugin This protocol is used to stitch microscope images using the FIJI plugin's \"Stitch Directory with Images (unknown configuration)\" under the Deprecated section. This process is suitable for combining multiple images into a single cohesive image, especially when the configuration of the images is not known beforehand. Requirements: FIJI (Fiji Is Just ImageJ) software installed and a directory containing microscope images to be stitched. Steps: Open FIJI: Launch the FIJI software on your computer. Prepare your images: Ensure all the images you want to stitch are in a single directory. Verify that the images have consistent naming conventions for easier processing. Access the stitching plugin: Go to Plugins in the menu bar. Navigate to Stitching and then select Stitch Directory with Images (unknown configuration) . Select the Image Directory : A dialog box will appear prompting you to select the directory containing your images ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Screenshot of FIJI Software highlighting access to the stitching plugin Click Browse or Choose and navigate to the folder where your images are stored. Select the directory and click OK ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Snapshot of FIJI Stitching window demonstrating access to the image directory Fusion Method: Choose the method for merging images; typically, \"Linear Blending\" or \"Max Intensity\" work well. Start stitching: Once all parameters are set, click OK to begin the stitching process. FIJI will process the images; this may take some time depending on the number and size of images. Review the stitched image: After the process is complete, the stitched image will be displayed. Inspect the image for any stitching errors or misalignments. If adjustments are necessary, you can tweak the parameters and repeat the process. Save the stitched image: Once satisfied with the stitched result, go to File > Save As . Choose the desired file format and location to save your stitched image. Post-processing (Optional): Perform any additional image processing if required, such as cropping, adjusting contrast, or applying filters using FIJI. Tips: For best results, ensure your images have consistent exposure and focus. If the images have significant overlap, reduce the overlap percentage to speed up processing. Save intermediate results periodically to avoid data loss in case of software crashes. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully stitch microscope images using the FIJI plugin, even when the configuration of the images is unknown ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Overview of stitching microscope images using the FIJI stitching plugin. In this example, four side images are taken using the soma of a neuron as the reference point. The images are then stitched together to generate a complete view of the neuron. After stitching, segment/crop the neuron using FIJI’s Image and then Crop function.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol was used to visualize the same class IV neuron (A3 and A4 segments) at discrete times over development, at 24 and 48 h and at 48 and 96 h, to test whether arbor expansion of neurons is by dilation of internal branches or tip growth and infilling. The larvae were mounted on an agar pad and imaged as described above, without using anesthetics. To minimize movement, imaging was performed at 4 °C for 2–5 min. After imaging, the larvae were returned to an apple agar plate in the Darwin chamber. The imaging was conducted using 20× and 40× objectives. For image analysis, the same neurons imaged at 24 and 48 h ( Figure 4 ) were segmented (FIJI/Image/Crop) and aligned (FIJI/Image/Rotate) using ImageJ software. This alignment allowed us to identify conserved non-terminal internal branches in the proximal region. This detailed approach enabled a precise study of the potential role of internal branch elongation in arbor growth. The fractional increases in branches and segment lengths were defined as F r a c t i o n a l l e n g t h c h a n g e = F i n a l l e n g t h - I n i t i a l l e n g t h I n i t i a l l e n g t h Figure 4. The same neuron imaged at 24 h (A) and 48 h (B) after egg laying (AEL) was segmented and aligned using ImageJ. Conserved internal branches were identified by overlaying the aligned images over each other using FIJI image tab and overlay tool (C) and marked with the same color-coded dotted lines and corresponding numbers (D&E). The length was measured using FIJI’s segmented line tool. The table on the right displays the lengths of these conserved internal or non-terminal branches along with their fractional length changes. The detail of data analysis of this method is also described in the Result section “Dendrite growth is not due to elongation of all branches in the arbor” and Figure 2 of Shree et al., 2022 [6]. Our measurements of internal branches of the same class IV neurons over developmental time using an agar pad method were also consistent with earlier assessments done by Baltruschat et al. [8].",

    "title": "Bi-directional Dual-flow-RootChip for Physiological Analysis of Plant Primary Roots Under Asymmetric Perfusion of Stress Treatments.",
    "abstract": "Due to technical limitations, research to date has mainly focused on the role of abiotic and biotic stress-signalling molecules in the aerial organs of plants, including the whole shoot, stem, and leaves. Novel experimental platforms including the dual-flow-RootChip (dfRC), PlantChip, and RootArray have since expanded this to plant-root cell analysis. Based on microfluidic platforms for flow stream shaping and force sensing on tip-growing organisms, the dfRC has further been expanded into a bi-directional dual-flow-RootChip (bi-dfRC), incorporating a second adjacent pair of inlets/outlet, enabling bi-directional asymmetric perfusion of treatments towards plant roots (shoot-to-root or root-to-shoot). This protocol outlines, in detail, the design and use of the bi-dfRC platform. Plant culture on chip is combined with guided root growth and controlled exposure of the primary root to solute changes. The impact of surface treatment on root growth and defence signals can be tracked in response to abiotic and biotic stress or the combinatory effect of both. In particular, this protocol highlights the ability of the platform to culture a variety of plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Solanum lycopersicum, on chip. It demonstrates that by simply altering the dimensions of the bi-dfRC, a broad application basis to study desired plant species with varying primary root sizes under microfluidics is achieved. Key features Expansion of the method developed by Stanley et al. (2018a) to study the directionality of defence signals responding to localised treatments. Description of a microfluidic platform allowing culture of plants with primary roots up to 40 mm length, 550 μm width, and 500 μm height. Treatment with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to permanently retain the hydrophilicity of partially hydrophobic bi-dfRC microchannels, enabling use with surface-sensitive plant lines. Description of novel tubing array setup equipped with rotatable valves for switching treatment reagent and orientation, while live-imaging on the bi-dfRC.

Note: Supplemental Files 1–3 are in .dxf format and can be viewed in the software eDrawings Viewer or modified in SolidWorks/Fusion360 (the latter is free for educational use). Transfer the pattern onto a photomask blank via laser mask writer. Position the photomask blank with AZ1518 photoresist layer onto the stage of a laser mask writer. Turn on the laser mask writer exposure. Develop the photomask in AZ326-MIF photoresist developer, for 1 min, at room temperature. Rinse the photomask with deionized water to stop development and then dry with a nitrogen gun. Note: Ensure that the photomask is thoroughly rinsed for at least 1–2 min during this process. Transfer the etched features of the bi-dfRC into the photomask via chrome etching. In an acid fume hood, submerge the fully developed photomask in chromium etchant solution, with manual agitation, for 1 min. Rinse the photomask with deionized water to stop etching and then dry with a nitrogen gun. To remove residual photoresist, rinse the photomask with acetone followed by methanol and isopropanol for 5 min each in a sonication bath. Note: This process yields a photomask containing fully developed etched features of the bi-dfRC microchannels. This mask can be re-used multiple times. Figure 1.

Wafer lamination Dehydrate a 4\" single-side polished silicon wafer at 180 °C for 24 h in a convection oven. Remove the silicon wafer using protective gloves and cool until safe to handle. Critical step: Avoid leaving wafer at room temperature for extended periods to avoid adsorption of moisture. Clean the silicon wafer in a plasma cleaner. Set the run cycle to a power of 100 W, pulse ratio of 255, and 5 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm) of oxygen for 10 min. Laminate negative-tone dry film photoresist to wafer (Data Sheets/Research Papers, 2020). Set the laminator rollers to 65 °C and speed 1. To avoid displacement while laminating, align the wafer on an aluminium sheet with raised stoppers. Partially cover the wafer with a first polyethylene sheet. Remove bottom protective cover off the photoresist and place the exposed side onto the polyethylene, partially overlapping the wafer. Cover with a second polyethylene sheet fixed to the aluminium sheet. Pass the setup under the rollers, removing the first polyethylene sheet in the process. Critical step: Stop the first polyethylene sheet from entering between the rollers to prevent it from sticking to the wafer. Remove laminated wafer and bake on a hotplate at 65 °C for 15 min. Mold fabrication Power on the mask aligner. Note: Allow the mask aligner to warm up for ~30 min. Using an ultraviolet intensity meter with a p365 nm sensor, check the ultraviolet intensity at the wafer holder. Set a fitted dose of 166.6 mJ/cm 2 at 365 nm, based on a dry film resist thickness of 100 μm, yielding a run time of 1,170 s (Data Sheets/Research Papers, 2021 ). Set a soft-contact run to multi-exposure for 10 s consecutive intervals with 1 min breaks, for 17 repeats. Note: This will prevent overheating of the photoresist, reducing mechanical stress within the cross-linked resist on the silicon wafer. Load the bi-dfRC mask. Position a photolithography mask aligner filter over the setup. Remove the top protective cover off the photoresist. Place the silicon wafer with the photoresist facing up onto the wafer holder of the mask aligner. Apply vacuum to the wafer holder, secure, close, and then start the pre-set mask aligner run. Post-exposure bake the exposed silicon wafer on a programmable hotplate, set to a cycle of 5 min at 65 °C, 20 min at 95 °C, and then 20 min at 20 °C. Critical step: Perform bake directly after exposure. Use a low ramping speed (15 °C/h) for the cool down step to reduce mechanical stress. Place the silicon wafer feature-side down onto a stainless-steel mesh submerged in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate developer, for 30 min or until fully developed. Wash the silicon wafer with fresh propylene glycol methyl ether acetate and isopropanol for 5 min. Hardbake the silicon wafer on a programmable hotplate for 1 h at 125 °C and then 20 min at 20 °C. Critical step: Use a low ramping speed (15 °C/h) for the cool down step to reduce mechanical stress. Note: After concluding photolithography, a silicon wafer with the bi-dfRC photo-developed structures is produced. The silicon wafer is used as a casting mold for soft lithography ( Figure 2a –2c). Due to the different root sizes, one A. thaliana bi-dfRC wafer yields 10 microchannels, one N. benthamiana bi-dfRC wafer yields five microchannels, and one S. lycopersicum bi-dfRC wafer yields one microchannel. Figure 2. Silicon wafer molds, with bi-dfRC photo-developed structures. Scale = 10 mm. (a) Silicon wafer for the A. thaliana bi-dfRCs comprise of 10 individual chip structures. (b) Silicon wafer for the N. benthamiana bi-dfRCs comprise of five individual chip structures. (c) Silicon wafer for the S. lycopersicum bi-dfRCs comprise of one individual chip structure. Silane treatment of mold wafer Treat the silicon wafer with anti-adhesion agent. Place the silicon wafer feature-side up into a vacuum desiccator. Add one drop of Trichloro (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane in an open glass shot bottle into the desiccator. Apply vacuum pumping for 5 min. Switch off the vacuum pump and keep the bi-dfRC mold in the desiccator under vacuum for 30 min. Notes: i. This will coat the silicon wafer and prevent sticking of the elastomer during subsequent soft lithography, protecting the photo-resist layer for repeated use. ii. Silane treatment was repeated following 10 subsequent uses of the wafer as a mold for soft lithography. Soft lithography Mix polydimethylsiloxane pre-polymer silicone elastomer base together with curing agent in a plastic container in a 10:1 (w/w) ratio. Place the mixture into a desiccator and apply vacuum for 30–60 min until bubbles have disappeared. Critical step: This will remove air bubbles from the mixture while assisting with solution mixing. Cast the wafer mold. Cover a 100 mm × 100 mm × 3 mm thick steel slab with a fresh polyethylene sheet and then place the silicon wafer atop, feature-side up. Note: Steel slab dimensions may vary but should fit inside the desiccator. Position a round 1.5 mm tall poly (methyl methacrylate) ring around the perimeter of the wafer. Note: This will create a seal around the edge of the wafer to avoid polydimethylsiloxane leakage during casting. Pour the pre-degassed polydimethylsiloxane mixture onto the silicon wafer. Place a fresh polyethylene sheet ¾ covering the setup, followed by another 100 × 100 × 3 mm thick steel slab. Note: This setup reduces pressure build up and adds a counterweight to hold the silicon wafer in place, while circumventing leakage of the polydimethylsiloxane between the poly (methyl methacrylate) ring and wafer. Transfer the setup into a desiccator and apply vacuum for ~40 min until bubbles have disappeared. Critical step: This will assist with the removal of additional air bubbles formed during pouring the polydimethylsiloxane. Transfer the setup from the desiccator to a hotplate set to 80 °C for 2 h. Note: The polydimethylsiloxane will cure into an elastic solid. Remove the poly (methyl methacrylate) ring from the edges of the wafer by gently probing the edges with a scalpel and then peel the polydimethylsiloxane off the wafer. Note: Place the pre-cured polydimethylsiloxane between two fresh polyethylene sheets. Bake the pre-cured polydimethylsiloxane on a hot plate for an additional 2 h at 80 °C. Note: The second heating cycle improves the curing of the polydimethylsiloxane. Allow the polydimethylsiloxane to cool; then, vertically punch the inlet/outlet channels with hole punches (1 mm for media inlets/outlets, 1–2 mm for the root inlet, and 3–4 mm for media port for all chip dimensions). Notes: i. Punch root inlets on an 135° obtuse angle from the glass base aligned with the feature pattern for optimal root growth into the bi-dfRC microchannel. ii. To avoid the polydimethylsiloxane tearing, twist the hole punch gently during extraction. Using a guillotine, cut away excess polydimethylsiloxane and separate the etched microchannels as desired. Note: Arabidopsis bi-dfRC fit two microchannel patterns to one 26 mm × 60 mm glass microscope slide, or five microchannels to one 76 mm × 83 mm coverslip. Nicotiana benthamiana and Solanum lycopersicum bi-dfRCs fit one microchannel to one 26 mm × 60 mm glass microscope slide. Plasma bonding Pre-clean glass microscope slides in acetone, followed by methanol and isopropanol for 5 min each. Place the glass slides and polydimethylsiloxane chips (feature-side up) onto the sample holder of a plasma cleaner. Note: Place a polyethylene transparent film under the polydimethylsiloxane to prevent bonding to the sample holder. Place the sample holder into the plasma cleaner. Set to run at 15 W power, pulse ratio of 50, and 5 sccm of oxygen for 1 min. Note: This will activate the bonding surfaces of the polydimethylsiloxane and glass. Remove the sample holder from the plasma cleaner and then bond the activated side of the polydimethylsiloxane chips to the glass coverslips by lightly pressing the exposed surfaces together. Note: If sub-optimal bonding occurs, see Troubleshooting 1. Place the bonded bi-dfRC on a hotplate at 80 °C for 2 h. Notes: This final heat cycle strengthens the bond between the polydimethylsiloxane and glass. For storage, place the bi-dfRCs in a desiccator for 3 h and then vacuum seal shut using vacuum-sealable food storage bags. Polyvinylpyrrolidone treatment (optional) Note: This procedure is utilised to permanently retain the hydrophilicity of the bi-dfRC microfluidic channels, to culture surface sensitive transgenic plant lines on chip, including G-CaMP3 Ca 2+ sensor lines (Allan et al., 2022 and 2023). Place the completed bi-dfRCs in the plasma cleaner for 30 W power, pulse ratio 50, and 5 sccm of oxygen for 3 min. Remove bi-dfRCs from the plasma cleaner. Add a drop of 22% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone onto the inlet of the bi-dfRC and then allow the solution to passively fill the microchannels. Leave the polyvinylpyrrolidone in the microchannels for ≥ 1 min and then wash three times with deionized water. Dry the microchannels with a nitrogen spray gun. Place the bi-dfRCs under vacuum desiccation for 2–3 h. Using a vacuum sealer, store the bi-dfRCs into any sturdy plastic container in a vacuum sealable food storage bag for up to one year. Epoxy dye treatment (optional, for chip visualisation) ( Soffe et al., 2020 ) Dissolve 2 mg of Sudan blue dye in 1 mL of toluene in a glass test tube. Add 250 μL of Norland Optical Adhesive with manual agitation. Ultrasonicate the glass test tube for 10 min. Evaporate off the toluene blue in a fume hood. Store solution at 4 °C until use. Pre-treat bi-dfRC microchannels in a plasma cleaner on run power 15 W, pulse ratio 50, oxygen flow rate of 3 sccm for a duration of 60 s. Place the post-activated bi-dfRCs into a desiccator. Add one drop of Trichloro (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane in a glass shot bottle into the desiccator. Apply vacuum pumping for 5 min. Sit the bi-dfRCs in the desiccator with the lid on for 1 h without vacuum. Note: This will allow the silane to coat the polydimethylsiloxane. Clean the polydimethylsiloxane surface and microchannels of the bi-dfRCs with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water, for 5 min. Dry the bi-dfRCs surfaces and microchannels with a pressurised nitrogen gun. Place the bi-dfRCs in a desiccator for 2 h. Note: Desiccation prior to adding the dye will remove the residual water absorbed by the polydimethylsiloxane substrate. Using a pipette, add 60 μL of the epoxy dye onto the root inlet of the bi-dfRCs. Note: Dye will passively enter the bi-dfRC microchannels. Clean excess epoxy dye from the outside surface of the polydimethylsiloxane using isopropyl alcohol. Expose the epoxy dye filled bi-dfRCs using an ultraviolet spot curing system, inverting each bi-dfRC every 2 h for the first 6 h of exposure, with the chip placed approximately 200 mm away from the light source. Notes: This technique allows for even exposure while ensuring rapid curing and minimisation of leeching into the polydimethylsiloxane. This protocol obtains high-quality images of the microfluidic device, with detailed illustration of the microchannels ( Figure 3a –3c). Figure 3. Epoxy dye (blue) filled microchannels of the bi-dfRCs, for visualisation . Scale = 5 mm. (a) Dyed microchannels of the A. thaliana bi-dfRCs. (b) Dyed microchannels of the N. benthamiana bi-dfRCs. (c) Dyed microchannel of the S. lycopersicum bi-dfRC. Plant media preparation Prepare half-strength (½) Murashige and Skoog medium with 3.1 mM MES in water (ultrapure) and adjust the pH of the solution to 5.6 (see Recipes). Separately, prepare 1% plant agarose in water (ultrapure) (see Recipes). Autoclave all media at 121 °C for 1–1.5 h. Under a laminar flow, prepare ½ Murashige and Skoog with 0.31 mM MES plant agarose plates (see Recipes). Note: Mixing of the stocks following autoclave allows for preparation of varying media concentrations, as desired. Alternatively, ½ MS/0.31 mM MES plant agar can simply be pre-prepared in a single bottle, prior to autoclave. Under a laminar flow, pour 50 mL of media into each 90 mm diameter Petri dish and leave to solidify. Seal the Petri dishes with parafilm. Store at 4 °C until use. Seed sterilisation and vernalisation Add approximately 50 seeds into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Add 1 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min with manual agitation. Note: For larger or rougher edged seeds (N. benthamiana and S. lycopersicum), add 40% bleach to the solution for 10–15 min. Remove the detergent solution with a pipette without disrupting the seeds. Add 70% ethanol for 2–5 min with manual agitation. Remove the 70% ethanol without disrupting the seeds. Wash the seeds four times with sterile water (ultrapure). On the final wash, keep 500 mL of sterile water (ultrapure) in the tube. Store the seeds in water at 4 °C for at least 12 h before use. Note: Incubation in the cold induces vernalisation of the seeds, to accelerate flowering after planting. Seed culture on agarose plates Under a laminar flow, plate pre-sterilised and vernalised seeds onto ½ Murashige and Skoog with 0.31 mM MES plant agarose plates using a sterile toothpick. Seal the Petri dishes with parafilm. Incubate the agarose plates vertically, on a short-day growth cycle [8 h light (8 am), 16 h dark (4 pm)]. Note: Sub-culture A. thaliana onto the bi-dfRC following 5 days incubation, N. benthamiana following 10–14 days incubation, and S. lycopersicum following 4–5 days incubation. At this time, roots will be the optimal length to sub-culture into the bi-dfRC root inlet (n = 100, data not shown). Plantlet culture on chip Remove bi-dfRCs from the vacuum storage bag. Under a laminar flow, surface sterilise the bi-dfRCs by exposure to ultraviolet light for 30 min. Add 100 μL of 70% ethanol into the microchannels. Note: This is a pre-sterilisation step to avoid microorganism growth during the subsequent incubation periods. If contamination prevails during incubation, see Troubleshooting 2. Wash out the ethanol by adding 100 μL of sterile water (ultrapure) into the microchannel three times. Replace the sterile water (ultrapure) with liquid ½ Murashige and Skoog with 0.31 mM MES media. Using tweezers, place small pre-cut ½ Murashige and Skoog with 0.31 mM MES agarose squares (0.5 mm, width, length, and height) next to the root inlets of the bi-dfRCs. Remove pre-cultured plants from incubation on agarose plates and subculture onto the bi-dfRC with tweezers. Note: Position the primary root of the plantlet directly into the root inlet channel containing liquid ½ Murashige and Skoog with 0.31 mM MES media and then gently position the leaves onto the adjacent agarose square ( Figure 4a –4f). Figure 4. Plant culture onto the bi-dfRCs. Scale = 5 mm. (a) 9-day-old A. thaliana roots cultured in the bi-dfRC observation channels. (b) 15-day-old N. benthamiana root cultured in the bi-dfRC observation channel. (c) 7-day-old S. lycopersicum root cultured in the bi-dfRC observation channel. Image series depicting the sub-culturing process of an A. thaliana root, firstly by aligning the plantlet at the pre-media-filled root inlet of the bi-dfRC (d), then gently situating the root tip into the root inlet (e), and finally resting the leaves onto a pre-cut agarose square (f). Place bi-dfRCs with cultured plantlets into Nunc TM OmniTray TM Single-Well Plates (plastic incubation chambers) with 10 mL of sterile water (ultrapure). Note: This will create a humid environment for successful plantlet growth. Seal the plastic incubation chambers with parafilm. Incubate the plates on short-day growth cycle [8 h light (8 am), 16 h dark (4 pm)] until imaging via microscopy. Notes: Place the plastic incubation chambers containing cultured bi-dfRCs on a 45-degree angle to promote root growth into the observation channel. A. thaliana roots will be ready to image from 8–10 days incubation, N. benthamiana roots will be ready to image from 15–17 days incubation, and S. lycopersicum roots will be ready to image from 7–10 days incubation (including the off-chip pre-incubation on agarose plates) (n = 100) (data not shown). The developmental stage of the primary root should show a defined tip, elongation zone, and differentiation zone of the root (root growth spanning up to 50% of microchannel). Syringe pump system and tubing array for media injection into the bi-dfRC microchannels Connect two plastic syringes onto a PhD 2000 Programmable Syringe Pump 70-2001 (multi syringe carrier capability) and set flow rate to 20 μL/min. Note: Maintaining steady flow rate is important for the retention of asymmetric fluid flow in the bi-dfRC observation channels. Connect the desired length of 1/16\" OD ethylene tetrafluoroethylene tubing to the plastic syringes via Quick Connect Luer adapters with ¼-28 Flangeless fittings. Construct the fluidic setup. Build the flow matrix by positioning the components, including 4× high-performance liquid chromatography grade manual switching valves V-100D (solution and directional change valves), 4× Low Pressure Unions for the waste (W1A–1B and W2A–2B), and 4× Low Pressure Unions for chip connection (Inlet: I1–I2 and outlet: O1–O2) ( Figure 5a –5b). Join the components together with the desired lengths of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene tubing. Critical step: It is essential that the two circuits are comprised of equal tubing distances (for both circuits, use 33 cm of tubing between syringes and solution change valves, 24 cm between solution change valves and directional change valves, 15 cm between directional change valves and inlet fittings, 33 cm from the inlet fittings to the bi-dfRC inlets, 33 cm from bi-dfRC outlets to outlet fittings, 15 cm between outlet fittings and directional change valves, and 15 cm to the waste; tubing length optimised for the mounted solution delivery array described below) to avoid unequal fluidic resistances, ensuring that the test solutions arrive at the bi-dfRC observation channel simultaneously. For issues with uneven asymmetric flow rate, see Troubleshooting 3. Optional: For ease, place the fluidic setup onto a raised mount. Screw the Manual Switching Valves into a pre-cut plastic Poly(methyl methacrylate) lid with defined holes/inlets for the high-performance liquid chromatography valves. Note: This will allow the flow matrix to be stable and visible during imaging. Raise the setup by attaching the plastic lid to a pre-constructed metal mount box. To construct the mental mount box, fit together four 200 mm Aluminium V slot Extrusion and four 300 mm Aluminium V slot Extrusions (cut in half, 150 mm) with four 20 series Corner 3-way Brackets. Note: Connect all extrusions together to form a 200 mm × 200 mm × 150 mm (L, W, H) cube. Attach a pre-cut plastic Poly (methyl methacrylate) lid to the top of the base skeleton. Attach the Low Pressure Unions (for waste and chip inlet/outlet) to the mount using four aluminium L brackets. Secure the setup with 20 M4 20 series T Slot Spring Nuts. Attach the four syringes mounted on the pump system to the flow matrix via the solution change high-performance liquid chromatography grade valves equipped with ¼-28 Flangeless fittings. Note: The setup proposed here creates parallel circuits for asymmetric flow, combining the choice of fluid on each side of the root, in addition to directional control ( Figure 5c –5d). Figure 5.

(d) Schematic diagram depicting the delivery of an asymmetric one-sided treatment A (green) through inlet 1 and treatment B (red) through inlet 2 of the bi-dfRC. Rotating the solution change valves as desired will switch which treatment enters the bi-dfRC, allowing application of full or half treatments. Adjusting the directional change valves will switch what side of the bi-dfRC the treatment enters, changing inlets 1 and 2 to outlets. Imaging Using an epi-fluorescent microscope (or desired microscope), place the bi-dfRCs connected to the tubing array onto the microscope stage. Focus on the sample with brightfield under a 5× lens (EC Plan-Neofluar 5×/0.15 M27). Pre-wet/restore filling of the flow matrix. Connect the syringe pump system equipped with the pre-solution-filled flow matrix to the bi-dfRC inlet/outlets. Secure the bi-dfRC with tubing attached onto the microscope stage. Note: For a known flow rate, refer to the following equation for the time it will take media to arrive at the bi-dfRC observation channel following solution change: t=(πr 2 )d/Q where t is the time, r is the tubing radius (internal), d is the tubing length, and Q is the flow rate. Conduct the desired experiments.\n\nValidation of protocol Successful A. thaliana wild-type Col-0 and transgenic G-CaMP3 plant culture and root growth into the bi-dfRC microchannel was replicated under PVP-treated microchannels (Allan et al., 2023, Figure 1d ). Successful culture of wild-type N. benthamiana and S. lycopersicum was shown in this protocol ( Figure 4a –4c). Bi-dfRC molds can be supplied as part of a collaboration or contract work (please contact volker.nock@canterbury.ac.nz ).",

    "title": "Cell-based Assay for Recruitment of DDR1 to Collagen-coated Beads.",
    "abstract": "The discoidin domain receptors, DDR1 and DDR2, are key signaling receptors for the extracellular matrix protein collagen. The interactions of cells with collagen are difficult to study because of the difficulty to obtain native collagen fibers for in vitro studies. Thus, in vitro studies often use acid-soluble collagens in the form of single triple helices, which are not representative of the densely packed insoluble collagen fibers found in tissues. In this protocol, we describe a method that allows stimulating DDR1 locally with collagen-coated beads. Latex beads are first coated with acid-soluble collagen, then added to cells expressing DDR1. Recruitment of DDR1 to the beads and collagen-induced DDR1 phosphorylation is visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy on a widefield microscope. In this method, densely packed collagen is presented to cells in an insoluble form. Bead coating is easy to perform, and this method thus presents a straightforward protocol with which to study local recruitment of collagen receptors to insoluble collagen.",

Seed Cos-7 cells on 13 mm coverslips in 24-well plates at 1 to 3 x 10 4 cells/ml in 500 μl complete DMEM/F12 medium per well to obtain around 30% confluency the next day. Notes: Coverslips were sterilized before use by placing coverslips in a glass beaker and heating in a microwave on full power for 5 min. After heating, the beaker was covered with cling film and aluminum foil and stored at room temperature. Exact cell number for cell seeding is not important but it is important that cells are less than 50% confluent on the day of transfection. After 24 h, transfect cells with relevant DDR1 expression plasmids using Fugene HD according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Note: Transfection conditions may need to be optimized but the transfection solution used for cells seeded on 24-well plates consisted of 50 μl/well OptiMEM medium, 0.25 μg/ml DNA and 0.75 μl/well Fugene HD. The transfection solution was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and added to the cells drop-wise. Medium was changed to fresh complete DMEM/F12 1 h before adding transfection mix. Change medium to fresh complete DMEM/F12 medium 4 h after transfection and incubate for another 24 h. Aspirate medium from cells and add 500 μl of serum-free DMEM/F12 medium/well. Incubate for 16 h before stimulation with collagen-coated beads. Coating of beads with collagen or control Note: Perform bead coating one day before stimulation of cells. We have not tested whether coated beads can be stored for longer times. Resuspend the latex beads thoroughly by vortexing and transfer aliquots to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for coating with collagen or control. Note: Each well is stimulated with 1 μl starting bead volume. When stimulating multiple wells, scale up the amount of beads for coating. For example, for stimulating 10 wells, aliquot 10 μl beads for coating. Wash the bead aliquot by adding 1 ml distilled water and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 × g ) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant. Note: The latex beads are supplied as a suspension composed of polymer particles and water, with small amounts of surfactant, sodium bicarbonate and potassium sulfate. Washing the beads in water is required to remove the other components. Resuspend the beads in 1 ml coating buffer and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 × g ) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant. Repeat Step B3. Resuspend beads in 500 μl coating buffer containing 20 μg/ml collagen I or 20 μg/ml BSA control. Incubate overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Note: We have only tested coating up to 20 μl beads. For coating of higher bead volumes, the coating buffer may need to be scaled up. After overnight incubation, add 500 μl 1x PBS to beads and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 × g ) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant to remove unbound collagen. To wash beads, add 1 ml 1x PBS to beads and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 × g ) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant. Add 1 ml 1% (w/v) BSA in 1x PBS to both collagen-coated and control beads. Incubate for 1 h on a rotating wheel at room temperature. Centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 × g ) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant. Resuspend beads in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. The beads are now ready to use. Note: Each well is stimulated with 1 μl of starting bead volume resuspended in 200 μl serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. For multiple wells, scale up accordingly. Stimulation of cells with collagen-coated beads Aspirate serum-free medium from Cos-7 cells grown on coverslips in 24-well plates. Resuspend the prepared collagen-coated or control-coated beads thoroughly by vortexing and add 200 μl resuspended beads per well to the cells. Centrifuge plate at 1,200 rpm (290 × g ) for 1 min to settle beads. Incubate at 37 °C for the required amount of time. In our study, we incubated the beads on cells for 10 min to 4 h. Cell fixing and staining Notes: This method explains labeling of surface DDR1 with an antibody against an extracellular epitope, fixing, permeabilization and labeling of phosphorylated DDR1 in Cos-7 cells grown on coverslips after stimulation with collagen-coated beads. Other relevant antibodies may be used for labeling different collagen receptors. After stimulation, wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl ice-cold 1x PBS. Take coverslips from each well with forceps and incubate face down with 30 μl primary anti-DDR1 antibody diluted at 2.5 μg/ml in 8% BSA (w/v), 1x PBS on parafilm spread on metal blocks on ice for 1 h to label cell surface DDR1 only. See Figure 1 for the experimental set-up. Transfer coverslips back to well with cell side facing up and wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS on ice. Aspirate washes. Fix cells by adding 500 μl 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS in a chemical fume hood for 15 min at room temperature. Discard paraformaldehyde solution. Caution: Paraformaldehyde is hazardous, perform fixation in a chemical hood and dispose of paraformaldehyde appropriately. Note: All subsequent steps are performed at room temperature. Wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS. Aspirate washes. Permeabilize cells by adding 500 μl 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 1x PBS for 5 min. Aspirate buffer. Block unspecific binding by incubating coverslips with 8% BSA (w/v) in 1x PBS for 1 h. Take coverslips from each well with forceps and incubate face down on parafilm with 30 μl primary anti-phosho-DDR1 antibody diluted 1:1,000 in 8% BSA (w/v), 1x PBS for 1 h to label phosphorylated DDR1. Transfer coverslips back to well with cell side facing up and wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS. Take coverslips from each well with forceps and incubate face down on parafilm with 30 μl appropriate secondary antibodies diluted 1:500 in 8% BSA (w/v), 1x PBS for 30 min. Protect from light. Transfer coverslips back to well with cell side facing up and wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS. Mount coverslips on slides with 10 μl Prolong Gold mounting medium. Airdry coverslips at room temperature overnight. Protect from light. Store at 4 °C or proceed to imaging under a fluorescent microscope. Imaging Image on a widefield microscope with brightfield capabilities using a 60x oil objective. The beads are imaged using a brightfield channel while total and phosphorylated DDR1 expressed in Cos-7 cells are imaged using appropriate FITC and TRITC fluorescent filters. Figure 1. Experimental set-up for incubation of coverslips with primary Ab solution on ice. A metal block is placed onto ice, and a piece of parafilm is placed on top of the metal block. The primary Ab solution is spotted in 30 μl aliquots onto the parafilm, then the coverslips are added with cells face down onto the Ab solution and incubated for 1 h.",

    "title": "A Simple Protocol for Periodic Live Cell Observation of Flagellate Stages in the Lichen Alga Trebouxia.",
    "abstract": "Flagellate stages of green microalgae such as Trebouxia are only partially characterised, with recent evidence suggesting that they are involved in both sexual and asexual reproduction. Conventional methods based on fixed samples in light, confocal, or electron microscopy provide only static observations and prevent real-time monitoring of living cells. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a simple and cost-effective protocol for observing Trebouxia flagellate cells over several days by coating microscopy slides with Bold's basal medium. The method preserves cell viability and allows repeated imaging of motile cells in the same areas so that their behaviour and development can be continuously observed. In this way, qualitative observations, such as flagellate cell release, motility, and gamete fusion, can be combined with quantitative analyses of cell morphology. The protocol has proven to be robust and reproducible and was applied to several Trebouxia species. Compared to existing techniques, it allows the monitoring of dynamic processes and provides a powerful tool to study specific life stages not only in Trebouxia but also in other unicellular and colonial green algae. Key features • This protocol allows real-time monitoring over several days of Trebouxia flagellate cells with standard light microscopy. • This protocol preserves cell viability and motility for repeated daily observations of the same cell groups. • This protocol is simple, low-cost, and adaptable to other motile algal cells. • This protocol is based on the methodology described in [1], where it was originally applied and validated.",

All the following stock solutions can be stored at 4 °C in glass bottles for at least 2–3 months after preparation. We recommend using autoclaved tips each time an aliquot is taken from the stock solutions and using different tips for each solution to avoid possible contamination and cross-contamination. If contamination is detected in a stock solution, discard it and prepare a fresh one before using it for the preparation of BBM or TM. 1.

It is better to have freshly prepared BBM every month, to be sure that all mineral nutrients are available to the algae when inoculation takes place and to minimise the possibility of contamination. Prepare solid BBM according to Recipe 4 [10]. Transfer all solutions into a 1 L glass bottle and add 500 mL of dH 2 O. Place a magnetic stirring bar in the bottle and put it on a magnetic stirrer. Gradually add agar (15 g/L) while stirring and wait until it is evenly suspended from the bottom of the bottle before adding more. Note that it will only dissolve during autoclaving.

Gradually add NaNO 3 (0.5 g/L), casein yeast peptone (10 g/L), and D-(+)-glucose (20 g/L) to BBM while stirring until all reagents are completely dissolved. To prepare solid TM, gradually add agar (15 g/L) while stirring and wait until the agar is evenly suspended before adding more. Note that agar will only dissolve during autoclaving. Add BBM to reach a final volume of 1 L. Note: Due to the presence of organic nutrients, TM is prone to contamination. Always prepare it fresh before use. This recipe is prepared according to the original formulation described in [11], which is based on Bold’s basal medium (BBM). TM is used only for maintenance of Trebouxia strains prior to the experiments; all microscopic observations are performed in BBM (see Recipe 4). Laboratory supplies 1. 9-cm diameter Petri dishes (Sarstedt, catalog number: 82.1473.001) 2. 15 mL Falcon ® tubes (Corning, Falcon ® , catalog number: 352096) 3. 100% cellulose adsorbent paper (Aurora, model: Soft 850) 4. Magnetic stirring bar 5. Microbox Junior 40 vessels (Sac O 2 , model: O95/40+OD95) 6. Microscopy slides (Menzel-Gläser, model: 76 × 26 mm, ground edges) 7. Plastic plug obtained by cutting the base of a syringe needle (Terumo, catalog number: AN*2332R1) 8. Razor blades (Gillette, model: silver platinum plus) 9. Sterile disposable loops (VWR, catalog number: 612-9358) 10. Sterile disposable syringes (Terumo, catalog number: MDSS20ESE) 11. Steripack ® pouches (PMS, catalog number: FP3050)\n\nProcedure A. Preparation of the slides for light microscopy observations 1. Prepare Bold’s basal medium (BBM) following the instructions given in Recipe 4. When the agar is well suspended (5–10 min depending on the amount), remove the stirring bar and autoclave the bottle along with razor blades, a 200 mL beaker, a 600 mL beaker containing slides, 5 µL and 5 mL pipette tips, and pieces of nylon net of 40 μm mesh. Wrap razor blades, nylon nets, and beakers individually in aluminium foil. Place them inside Steripack ® pouches and seal them using a heat sealer before autoclaving. Use a standard sterilisation cycle (21 min at 121 °C and 1.1 bar). 2. Place 9-cm diameter Petri dishes, disposable syringes, and disposable loops in the biological hood and expose them to UV light for 20 min to sterilise the external surfaces of the packages and the working environment. Then, switch on the hood’s laminar flow for a further 20 min. Note: Only open sterile Petri dishes in the biological hood. 3. When the sterilisation cycle of the autoclave is complete, transfer all sterilised materials to the biological hood. Caution: Wait until the BBM has cooled down to at least 90 °C to avoid handling boiling liquids. Do not wait until the temperature drops below 60 °C; otherwise, the agar will begin to solidify. 4. Place a glass microscopy slide in a Petri dish and pour approximately 25 mL of hot, liquid BBM, so that the slide is covered with a 2 mm thick layer ( Figure 1A , D). Note: A thinner layer will dehydrate too quickly, while a thicker layer will result in dark and indistinct images due to poor light transmission. Figure 1. Preparation of Bold’s basal medium (BBM)-coated microscopy slides. (A) Petri dish with a microscopy slide in it, covered with solidified BBM. (B) The appearance of the BBM-coated microscopy slide after trimming the BBM in excess along the edges. (C) Slide marked with a waterproof marker to ensure a constant orientation during microscopy observations. (D) Lateral view of a BBM-coated slide, with a BBM layer of 2 mm. Scale bar = 5 mm. 5. Once the BBM has solidified, trim along the edges of the slide with a sterile razor blade and discard the excess medium ( Figure 1B ). Pause point: The slides can be sealed in Petri dishes with Parafilm ® (while in the biological hood) and stored at 4 °C for up to 3–4 weeks. 6. Remove a small portion of the BBM layer from one side of each slide to expose the glass surface, then mark the slide (e.g., with a waterproof marker) to ensure constant orientation during microscopy observations ( Figure 1C , D). This allows reliable use of the microscope’s coordinate system and tracking of the same cell groups over several days. 7. Moisten absorbent paper with sterile dH 2 O until it is evenly moist but not dripping. 8. Line the bottom of the Petri dishes containing the slides with the moist paper to ensure high humidity during the experiments. Note: Although this step ensures high humidity, it will cause the system to lose its sterility. However, BBM is a medium with only mineral nutrients, so it does not contaminate quickly; the system should be contamination-free for up to 14 days. B. Preparation of TM and vessels for maintenance of Trebouxia strains 1. Place the Microbox Junior 40 vessels inside Steripack ® pouches and seal them using a heat sealer. 2. Prepare TM following the instructions given in Recipe 5. When the agar is well suspended, remove the stirring bar and autoclave the bottle together with the vessels. Use a standard sterilisation cycle (21 min at 121 °C and 1.1 bar). 3. When the sterilisation cycle is complete, transfer all sterilised materials to the biological hood. Caution: Apply the same safety precautions described for handling hot BBM when working with TM. 4. Pour hot TM into the vessels and allow it to solidify at room temperature. This process usually takes about 30 min. Note: Vessels can be stored at 4 °C, but due to the presence of organic nutrients, they are prone to contamination. Carefully inspect each vessel before use. C. Preparation of the algal suspension and inoculation on BBM-coated slides 1. After 3 weeks of growth on solid TM under the conditions described in the Biological materials section, collect 0.4 g of cells from each Trebouxia vessel with a sterile disposable loop. The cell mass can be determined by transferring the collected material to a pre-weighed Falcon ® tube and measuring the fresh weight on an analytical balance. 2. Transfer 15 mL of liquid BBM (see Recipes) into a sterile 15 mL Falcon ® tube using a 0.5–5 mL pipette with autoclaved tips. To facilitate handling, first add 10 mL of BBM, then add the collected cells, and finally top up to the final volume of 15 mL with additional BBM. The algal cells will be clumped together. Depending on the species, the clumps will be smaller or larger ( Figure 2A ). Figure 2. Homogenisation of the algal suspension. (A) Algal cells forming large clumps at the bottom of the Falcon ® tube containing liquid Bold’s basal medium (BBM). (B) Needleless syringe with the algal suspension ready to be homogenised. 1: algal suspension; 2: Nylon net of 40 μm mesh; 3: plastic plug of a syringe needle. (C) Homogenised algal suspension. 3. Attach a piece of nylon net of 40 μm mesh to the tip of a needleless syringe and secure it with the plastic plug of a fitting syringe needle ( Figure 2B ). 4. Remove the plunger from the syringe and pour the algal suspension into the syringe. Gently homogenise the suspension by pushing it through the nylon net with the syringe plunger ( Figure 2C ). Apply only light pressure to avoid damaging the cells. Note: This step breaks apart large aggregates of cells and ensures an even distribution of cells for inoculation. If the aggregates are too large, filter the suspension through a 100 μm nylon mesh first. 5. Inoculate 5 μL of the algal suspension onto the surface of a BBM-coated slide, prepared as described in section A, using a 0.5–10 μL pipette with autoclaved tips. Each inoculum should be placed as a small droplet, which limits the area to be observed under the microscope. Two or three inocula can be placed on the same slide without risk of cross-contamination, as the BBM layer prevents liquid spreading. Critical: Do not cover the inoculated area with a coverslip to avoid uncontrolled spread of flagellate cells. 6. Place the slides back into Petri dishes lined with moist adsorbent paper and incubate in a thermostatic chamber at 20 ± 1 °C, under 23 ± 1 μmol photons·m -2 ·s -1 , with a 12/12 h light/dark regime. D. Light microscopy observations and monitoring of selected cells 1. Place the BBM-coated slides (prepared as in section A and inoculated as in section C) on the stage of a light microscope. 2. Scan the surface of the slide and identify regions of interest that contain cells or groups of cells to be observed during the experiment. 3. Take note of the coordinates of each selected area using the microscope’s coordinate system. Note: This step allows the same cells to be re-localised for subsequent observations. 4. Acquire images and/or videos of the selected cells using the camera attached to the microscope. Note: If the microscope is not in a sterile environment (e.g., under a biological hood), sterility will be lost after the first observation. The presence of moist absorbent paper in the Petri dishes may already compromise sterility. However, as stated in section A, the system should be free of contamination for up to 14 days. 5. Place the slides back into the Petri dishes lined with moist absorbent paper and continue the incubation under the same conditions, as described in section C. 6. Repeat the observations daily to monitor the same cell groups over time. Critical: As the algal cells will continue to grow, the field of view will become increasingly crowded. Daily observations are recommended to ensure reliable identification of the monitored cell groups.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol was used and validated in the following research article: • Boccato et al. [1]. Zoospore diversity and sexual reproduction in the lichen-forming genus Trebouxia : From neglected motile cells to new evidence of sexual stages. Plant Biology (Figures 1–4, Figures S1–S2, Table S1, and Videos S1–S8). The use of this system made it possible to successfully observe the development and behaviour of live flagellate cells over several days. The reproducibility of the method was demonstrated for four Trebouxia species ( T. decolorans, T. gelatinosa, T. vagua , and T. angustilobata ), belonging to three phylogenetic clades.",

    "title": "Detection of Autophagy in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Using Guava® Autophagy and Flow Cytometry.",
    "abstract": "Autophagy plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis and is responsible for removing and degrading damaged cytoplasmic cargo. This lysosome-mediated catabolic process removes defective organelles and misfolded proteins, and impaired autophagy has been directly linked to ageing and numerous diseases. This emphasises the importance of developing intervention methods to counteract this dysregulation. One promising intervention is thermal therapy, specifically hyperthermia, which is described in this protocol. In order to investigate this form of treatment, a rapid and reliable detection method is required to allow comparison of autophagy status under different conditions. While methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or western blotting can provide valuable structural analysis, they are often time-consuming and expensive, and are not suitable for small, round cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The method described in this protocol enables absolute quantification of PBMCs using the Guava® Autophagy Detection kit after heat treatment with water-filtered infrared-A radiation (wIRA), compared with an untreated control. This method is based on antibody labelling, and subsequent flow cytometric analysis enables the number of autophagosomes to be determined by measuring the FITC intensity. This protocol provides rapid, reliable results and can be adapted to investigate not only heat therapy, but also other interventions, such as caloric restriction. Key features • Rapid and reliable ex vivo quantification of autophagy in living cells. • Optimised protocol for the determination of autophagy in primary human blood cells. • Allows the testing of active substances and treatments concerning autophagy. • Flow cytometry-based method for the determination of autophagy.",

PBMC isolation 1. Warm the Ficoll-Paque TM PLUS separation medium to room temperature (RT), protected from light, and fill the Leucosep TM tube with 15 mL separation medium. Centrifuge at 1,000× g for 1 min at RT. The separation medium is now located below the porous barrier. Note: All centrifugation steps are carried out at RT. 2. Dilute an appropriate volume of anticoagulated human blood (collected in 9 mL of K3 EDTA S-Monovette ® ) at a ratio of 1:2 with 0.9% NaCl solution in a separate centrifuge tube. Transfer the diluted blood carefully into the prepared Leucosep TM tube (at least 15 mL and at most 30 mL). 3. Centrifuge at 1,000× g for 10 min in a swing-out rotor with brake switched off. Figure 2. Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation using Leucosep TM tubes. On the left side, the porous barrier separates the Ficoll-Paque TM PLUS (bottom) and the diluted anticoagulated blood (top). On the right side, after centrifugation, the sequence of layers occurs as follows (from top to bottom): plasma > enriched cell fraction (PBMCs) > Ficoll-Paque TM PLUS > porous barrier > Ficoll-Paque TM PLUS > erythrocytes and granulocytes. 4. Collect and discard approximately 10 mL of plasma from the top ( Figure 2 ), leaving a minimum remnant of 5–10 mm above the interphase, to prevent contamination of the enriched cells with platelets and facilitate harvesting of the enriched cell fraction. 5. Harvest the enriched cell fraction (lymphocytes/PBMCs) using a 1,000 μL Eppendorf pipette. The porous barrier effectively prevents recontamination with pelleted erythrocytes and granulocytes (for detailed information, see the manufacturer's instructions or refer to [8]). 6. Wash the cells with 15 mL of 1× PBS and subsequently centrifuge at 250× g for 10 min with the brake switched back on. 7. Repeat the washing step twice, resuspending the cell pellet in 10 mL of PBS each time. 8. Determine the cell count using acridine orange/propidium iodide stain and the Luna TM fl Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter. B. Cell seeding and treatment 1. Prepare six wells per plate (control plate, treatment plate) with 500,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate (V-bottom) in 200 μL of RPMI medium ( Figure 3a .) or 200 μL of RPMI medium with 40 μM chloroquine (CQ; diluted with RPMI medium from 600 µM CQ in DMSO) ( Figure 3b .) in triplicate ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Plate layouts. Both the control plate (left) and the treatment plate (right) contain three wells with RPMI medium (a.) for measurement and six wells with RPMI medium with 40 µM chloroquine (b.) as a positive control. 2. The IRAcubator should be preheated to 39 °C. 3. Place the control plate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 for 1 h. 4. Place the treatment plate in the IRAcubator at 39 °C for 1 h ( Figure 3 ) (for detailed information, refer to [7]). C. Guava ® autophagy detection 1. After incubation with CQ and/or treatment, centrifuge the plates at 300× g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant by turning the plate(s) over onto laboratory tissue paper. 2. Resuspend the pellets in 100 μL of 1× assay buffer, then centrifuge the plates again at 300× g for 5 min. Note: Allow all assay components to reach RT. 3. After centrifugation, add 100 μL of autophagy reagent B directly to each well, then immediately centrifuge again at 300× g for 5 min. Caution : Do not discard the supernatant; otherwise, the concentration of autophagy reagent B will be incorrect. 4. Discard the supernatant by turning the plate(s) over onto laboratory tissue paper. Resuspend the pellets in 100 μL of LC3 staining solution and leave to incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark. Note: All subsequent steps are carried out in the dark. 5. After incubation, centrifuge at 300× g for 5 min and discard the supernatant by turning the plate(s) over onto laboratory tissue paper. 6. Wash the samples once with 100 μL of 1× assay buffer to remove any residual or unbound antibody. 7. Centrifuge at 300× g for 5 min and discard the supernatant by turning the plate(s) over onto laboratory tissue paper. 8. Resuspend the pellets in 100 μL of 1× assay buffer and then leave the plates for 10 min at RT in the dark, directly before measurement. 9. Analyse samples via flow cytometry with BD FACSVerse TM for data acquisition. D. Data acquisition 1. The analysis of antibody-based LC3 detection is carried out via flow cytometry using a BD FACSVerse TM instrument. Samples are measured directly in 96-well plates using a universal loader. Caution : Make sure to use the right plate geometry (Corning ® standard conical bottom). 2. After manually gating the lymphocytes using forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) is measured ( Figure 4 ). 3. A total of 10,000 events are gated, and the FITC-A median is defined as the MFI and used for subsequent analysis. Figure 4. Forward scatter/side scatter (FSC/SSC) and histogram plots for the gating process (LC3 detection). As only a subpopulation (lymphocytes) of the total measured cells is relevant for LC3 detection, the corresponding population is manually gated in the FSC and SSC plots (left). Based on this population, the number of FITC-positive events is measured in the histogram (right).\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol (or parts of it) has been used and validated in the following research articles: Hochecker et al.

    "abstract": "Matrix vesicles (MVs) represent a heterogeneous group of spherical membrane-bound extracellular vesicles in the range of 100-200 nm in diameter secreted by mineralizing osteoblasts. The initial synthesis of the amorphous calcium phosphate occurs within the confines of the intracellular MVs, which are capable of transporting Pi and Ca2+ into the MV lumen. Thus, understanding the initial process of MV-mediated mineralization is critical in developing better therapeutic strategies for various bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis and addressing ectopic calcification of soft tissues. Although various techniques and commercially available kits are now available for isolating MVs, isolating a pure population of MVs is challenging mainly because of their variable size and lack of consensus protein markers. This ultracentrifugation-based protocol ensures high purity of isolated MVs by removing other contaminated extracellular vesicles and cellular debris through sequential centrifugation steps but also allows downstream functional mineralization assays of the isolated MVs. Key features • Simple and rapid high-quality isolation of MVs from in vitro culture of mineralizing osteoblasts by ultracentrifugation. • Use of isolated MVs for various functional assays such as mineralization efficacy. • Cell-free mineralization assay to determine intrinsic mineralization efficacy of the isolated MVs under desired experimental conditions.",

A mineralizing subclone 4 of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast progenitor cell line (ATCC # CRL-2593) was selected because it exhibits high osteoblast differentiation and mineralization after growth in media containing ascorbic acid and inorganic phosphate. 2. Culture MC3T3-E1 cells (passages 8–21) in a T25 flask with 5 mL of growth media at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . 3. Under standard growth and maintenance conditions, replace the culture medium every two days and subculture cells at a 1:4 ratio with 0.25% trypsin at 80%–90% confluency. 4. To induce osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, seed 2.5–3 × 10 6 MC3T3-E1 cells in 30 mL of growth media in a T150 flask with regular media change every two days. Grow until 80%–90% confluency is reached. At that point, switch media from growth to osteogenic media and culture for an additional 21 days with media changes every three days. 5. Collect osteogenic media after 21 days of culture for MV isolation and place on ice. Note: If not subjected to MV isolation immediately, the conditioned osteogenic media can be stored at -80 °C for several weeks without compromising the quality and quantity of MVs. B. Isolation of matrix vesicles by ultracentrifugation Note: All subsequent steps should be conducted at 4 °C and samples should be kept on ice. 1. Centrifuge the osteogenic media at 2,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any cell debris. 2. Collect the supernatant into a fresh 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 20,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove large-sized vesicles or apoptotic bodies. Note: Alternatively, filter the supernatant using a 0.45 μm syringe filter. 3. Transfer the supernatant into pre-chilled ultracentrifuge polypropylene tubes. 4. Centrifuge at 100,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C for MV isolation. 5. Gently decant the supernatant and suspend the MV pellet in 50 μL of ice-cold 1× DPBS by pipetting up and down. Note: The pellet may be difficult to see clearly. In such a case, it is recommended to carefully remove the supernatant, leaving up to 10 μL behind. 6. The resulting MV suspension in 20 μL of DPBS is ready for downstream analysis or can be stored in a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube at -80 °C for later use. Note: Average MV yield from 30 mL of culture media of one T150 flask ranges between 35 and 50 μg of protein. C. Characterization of matrix vesicles 1. Quantification of total MV protein by BCA analysis: a. Prepare BSA dilutions (see Table 1 ) in 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes to obtain a BCA standard curve. Table 1. BCA standard curve preparation Albumin standard dilution (mg/mL) Albumin stock solution (2 mg/mL) (μL) H 2 O (μL) 2.00 200 - 1.00 100 100 0.5 50 150 0.25 25 175 0.125 12.5 187.5 0.0625 6.25 193.75 b. Add 80 μL of 1× RIPA buffer and 2 μL of protease inhibitor cocktail to 20 μL of MVs suspended in 1× DPBS and mix thoroughly. i. Keep the MVs suspended in lysis solution for 1 h for protein enrichment. ii. Centrifuge at 14,000× g for 20 min. iii. Collect the supernatant in a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. c. Pipette 10 μL of BSA standards and MV sample in triplicates in the same 96-well plate. d. Add 200 μL of BCA working solution to each well. e. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min and evaluate the protein concentration at OD 562 nm with a microplate reader. f. Calculate the protein concentration by plotting the BCA standard curve (see Table 2 ). Table 2. BCA analysis. Total MV protein calculation performed by BCA analysis. Six BSA standards in serial dilutions were used and average absorbance was calculated at 562 nm.

Size evaluation and quantification by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA): NTA is an advanced technique utilized to measure the size distribution of MVs. This method tracks the Brownian motion of individual vesicles within a laser-illuminated sample, providing precise particle size measurements in real time [11]. a. Dilute the isolated MV sample in 1 mL of DPBS and vortex for 15 s. b. Using a needleless syringe, slowly inject the MV solution into the chamber of the particle size analyzer, taking care to avoid bubbles. c. Ensure there are approximately 30–50 particles in the field of view to achieve accurate concentration and size measurements ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) of isolated matrix vesicles (MVs). NTA histogram showing the size distribution of MVs isolated from osteogenic media of MC3T3-E1 cell culture on Day 0 (confluency; blue curve) and Day 21 of post-confluent osteogenic culture (red curve). Shaded grey areas represent SEM. 3. (Optional) Examine the calcium-to-phosphate (Ca/P) ratio within the isolated MVs by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS). SEM–EDS is a powerful technique employed for the identification and quantification of Ca 2+ and P content by detecting the characteristic X-rays emitted by calcium and phosphorus atoms when the MVs are exposed to a focused electron beam [12]. a. Deposit 10 μL of MV suspension prepared in sterile DPBS on lacey carbon-coated 300 mesh copper grids. b. Air dry the MV sample for 30 min at room temperature and observe under 200 kV HF5000 transmission electron microscope equipped with an adapter for X-ray microanalysis energy dispersive spectrometer. c. The images and EDS mapping were taken in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS) analysis of the isolated matrix vesicles (MVs). (A) Representative SEM image of the isolated MVs deposited on the copper grid. Representative imaging of calcium (B, red) and phosphorus (C, green) and their overlay (D) using SEM-EDS. (E) Spectral map of isolated MV composition represented as atomic % of individual elements detected. In mature hydroxyapatite (HA), the approximate Ca/P ratio is 1.6, though the composition of amorphous calcium phosphate in MVs can vary, leading to the observed value of 1.37. Scale bar = 250 nm. d. Spectral and compositional analysis is performed, and data is expressed as a percentage of the sum of the known elements detected within the MVs to indicate the content of Ca and P (as atomic %). 4. Examine the mineralization efficacy of isolated MVs by cell-free calcification assay. a. Place the collagen-coated glass coverslips in the wells of a 12-well cell culture plate. b. Add 25 μg of MV (based on protein assay) to each coverslip in the presence of 200 μL of osteogenic media and ensure it is evenly distributed across the coverslip surface. c. Incubate the coverslips at 37 °C for 72 h in a CO 2 incubator. d. After 72 h, gently remove (decant) the osteogenic media from the coverslips without disturbing the MV-collagen matrix. e. Gently wash the coverslips once with 1× DPBS and add 250 μL of 0.6 N HCl to each well to cover the coverslips completely. Incubate at room temperature for 24 h to decalcify the matrix. g. After 24 h of decalcification, collect the 250 μL of HCl supernatant carefully without disturbing the coverslips. h. Measure the calcium content in the HCl supernatant using a colorimetric Ca 2+ assay kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3.

Cell-free in vitro MV-collagen calcification assay with MVs isolated from Day 0 and Day 21 culture media of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been validated and implemented to generate Figure 5 from the following research article: • Sheikh et al.

    "title": "Cell-Sonar, an Easy and Low-cost Method to Track a Target Protein by Expression Changes of Specific Protein Markers.",
    "abstract": "Different research methods aim to clarify the intracellular trafficking of target proteins or unknown pathways. Currently, existing methods are mostly complex and expensive, requiring expert knowledge. Detailed microscopy for protein co-localization detection or omic technologies, which provide holistic network data, are elaborate, mostly complex, and expensive to apply. Our protocol illustrates a method to track a target protein by detecting expression changes of user-selected marker proteins that directly or indirectly interact with the target. Modulation of protein expression indicates interactions between the target and marker protein. Even without co-localization analysis, the results of the protein expression change are the first insights into the target's fate. Moreover, the use of the cell-sonar is straightforward and affordable, and the results are rapidly available. Furthermore, this method could also be used to determine if and how pathways are affected by compounds added to the cells. In conclusion, our method is adaptable to a wide range of proteins, easy to apply, inexpensive, and expandable with substances that affect proteins. Key features • Easy-to-implement method to track intracellular proteins. • Marker protein expression change demonstrates protein interaction. • Combined data of all marker proteins is used to give an indirect overview of protein localization. • This method is also applicable to different compounds and thus provides information about protein induction or influence on pathways.",
    "methods": "Materials and reagents The following protocol instructions refer to the ER as the selected cellular area. Depending on the research question, the method can be expanded to additional cellular areas or various cellular pathways. In the following, we describe the basic principle and application of the method. We illustrate our protocol with two different cell lines, two different target proteins, and one compound to demonstrate the versatility of the cell-sonar method. Furthermore, we use the in-cell western method for the detection of protein expression changes but, of course, other methods such as on-cell western, western blot, or fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis can also be used for this detection.

Seed CHO cells in culture medium and 16.5% FCS, and GH 4 C 1 cells in the same medium with 10% FCS supplement in different black 96-well microplates in linearly increasing cell counts: 0, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, and 50,000 cells. Apply biological and technical triplicates in corresponding culture media each with 100 μL as the final volume per well. 2. Incubate plates for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , and 90% humidity. 3. Perform cellular fixation and permeabilization in a fume hood with 50 μL of 100% MeOH (-20 °C) per well for 10 min at room temperature. 4. Gently wash each well three times with 150 μL of PBS for 5 min. 5. Block every well with 150 μL of blocking buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature at 180 rpm. 6. Apply cell tag stain 700 solution, necessary for normalization on cell counts, at 50 μL/well and incubate for 1 h at room temperature at 180 rpm, protected from light. Therefore, dissolve cell tag stain 700 in 100 μL of PBS and incubate for 30 min at room temperature protected from light; the concentration per well is 0.2 μM. 7. Gently wash each well three times with 150 μL of PBST for 5 min. 8. Add 100 μL of PBS per well before scanning plates with Odyssey CLx Imager using the Image Studio software. 9. Scan the plate with the following settings: resolution = 169 μm, quality = medium, and focus offset = 3.8 mm. Note: Focus offset needs to be adjusted for different plates. 10. Match each scanned fluorescence per well utilizing the special grid of the Analysis tab of the software menu. 11. Export the data as an Excel report and use the detected fluorescence signals to determine the linear regression for cell count normalization. B.

Seed 30,000 CHO and GH 4 C 1 cells in different black 96-well microplates in biological triplicates and four technical replicates in corresponding culture media each with 100 μL as the final volume per well. In the case of nicotine treatment, the final concentration of nicotine in the wells was 30 μM. Note: Nicotine treatment was performed in our case regarding its anticipated effect on receptors and as an example of compound application in the cell-sonar method. 2. Incubate plates for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , and 90% humidity. 3. Perform cellular fixation and permeabilization with 50 μL of 100% MeOH (-20 °C) per well for 10 min at room temperature. 4. Gently wash each well three times with 150 μL of PBS for 5 min. 5. Block every well with 150 μL of blocking buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature at 180 rpm. 6. Apply 50 μL of primary antibody solution/well and incubate for 2.5 h at room temperature at 180 rpm. Perform each microplate with controls, which are shown in Figure 2 . 7. Gently wash each well three times with 150 μL of PBST for 5 min. 8. Apply cell tag stain 700 solution, necessary for normalization on cell counts, at 0.2 μM concentration and secondary antibody dilution at 50 μL/well and incubate for 1 h at room temperature and 180 rpm protected from light. Do not add cell tag stain 700 solution to the control wells of the secondary antibody signal alone (see Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Schematic microplate overview with controls and samples. The plate layout shows how to handle controls (I–IV) and samples (V–X). I. Add three wells with blocking buffer only. II. Add three wells with cells in blocking buffer only. III. Add two wells (in sum 12 wells) for each solution of all individual primary antibodies on cells in blocking buffer. IV. Add three wells (in sum 6 wells) for each solution of all individual secondary antibodies on cells in blocking buffer all without adding cell tag stain 700. V–X. Performed for marker protein expression level detection; each marker protein in a biological triplicate (n = 3) and with four technical repeats, for a total of 12 wells. To these wells, primary antibody solution, secondary antibody solution, and cell tag stain 700 were added. This microplate had to be performed eight times in total for host CHO and GH 4 C 1 cells, for host CHO and GH 4 C 1 cells under nicotine treatment, for transduced CHO and GH 4 C 1 cells, and for transduced CHO and GH 4 C 1 cells under nicotine treatment. 9. Gently wash each well three times with 150 μL of PBST for 5 min. 10. Add 100 μL of PBS/well before scanning plates with Odyssey CLx Imager using Image Studio software. 11. Scan the plate with the following settings: resolution = 169 μm, quality = medium, and focus offset = 3.8 mm. Note: Focus offset needs to be adjusted for different plates. 12. Match each scanned fluorescence per well by utilizing the special grid of the Analysis tab of the software menu. 13. Export data as an Excel report and utilize the detected fluorescence signals for analysis of the expressed protein levels.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been used and validated in the following research article: • Brockmöller et al. [15]. Cell-sonar, a Novel Method for Intracellular Tracking of Secretory Pathways. Cells 13(17), (complete publication, three chosen cellular areas: the ER, between the ER and Golgi, and the endocytic pathway, with CHO cells and transgene α1 2 β1δε nAChR). Additionally, this protocol has been used and validated in previously unpublished experiments with GH 4 C 1 cells and the transgene α7 nAChR. Initially, we performed a western blot from purified protein solutions to demonstrate that α7 nAChR is expressed in the transgene GH 4 C 1 cell line but not in the GH 4 C 1 host cell line ( Figure 3 ). The cell-sonar was performed with UGGT1, CN, Hrd1, BiP, Sil1, and GAPDH, which are marker proteins for the ER area [15], in the presence and absence of nicotine treatment. The results are presented in Figure 4 . As described in the Data Analysis section, changes in protein expression were detected for five marker proteins, which means that the presence of α7 nAChR can be indirectly detected without western blot analysis. Furthermore, the ER area is divided into ATP-dependent ( Figure 4A ) and calnexin cycle–dependent domains ( Figure 4B ). The receptor also interacts differently with these marker proteins without and under nicotine treatment. Our protocol has also been applied to our laboratory procedures to gain new insights into some secretory pathways under different aspects and target proteins. Figure 3. Western blot of the α7 subunit of nAChR from transgene (+) and host GH 4 C 1 (-) cells. Western blot was performed from 57 ng of purified protein solutions of both GH 4 C 1 cell lines.

    "title": "Studying the Protein Quality Control System of D. discoideum Using Temperature-controlled Live Cell Imaging.",
    "abstract": "The complex lifestyle of the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum makes it a valuable model for the study of various biological processes. Recently, we showed that D. discoideum is remarkably resilient to protein aggregation and can be used to gain insights into the cellular protein quality control system. However, the use of D. discoideum as a model system poses several challenges to microscopy-based experimental approaches, such as the high motility of the cells and their susceptibility to photo-toxicity. The latter proves to be especially challenging when studying protein homeostasis, as the phototoxic effects can induce a cellular stress response and thus alter to behavior of the protein quality control system. Temperature increase is a commonly used way to induce cellular stress. Here, we describe a temperature-controllable imaging protocol, which allows observing temperature-induced perturbations in D. discoideum. Moreover, when applied at normal growth temperature, this imaging protocol can also noticeably reduce photo-toxicity, thus allowing imaging with higher intensities. This can be particularly useful when imaging proteins with very low expression levels. Moreover, the high mobility of the cells often requires the acquisition of multiple fields of view to follow individual cells, and the number of fields needs to be balanced against the desired time interval and exposure time.",
    "methods": "Protocol 1. Cell Preparation Growing cells Grow D. discoideum cells in AX medium at 23 °C under light in tissue culture plates. Avoid keeping cells at high densities above 75% confluency. NOTE: For an optimal response to heat stress, cells need to be in the exponential growth phase and should not have reached stationary phase. The day before imaging, split cells into low fluorescence medium (LFM) to 1 x 10 4 cells/ml. NOTE: This step is necessary to reduce background fluorescence caused by the AX medium. The incubation time can be reduced to a minimum of 2 hr. However, vesicles taken up in AX medium can still generate some background signal after 2 hr. Preparing cells for microscopy Before imaging, harvest cells from the tissue plate in LFM and transfer an adequate number of cells into glass bottom dishes. NOTE: Usually, 1 x 10 5 cells/ml is sufficient; however, if the experimental setup requires long imaging periods (longer than 8 hr), cell numbers need to be carefully adjusted, as D. discoideum cells will transition to the developmental cycle and start to stream and aggregate if cell numbers are high while nutrients are low. Allow the cells to settle for 20 min. Remove non-settled cells by carefully replacing the used medium with fresh medium. 2. Imaging NOTE: The protocol can be used on wide-field systems as well as in confocal microscopy setups. The usage of a temperature-controlled incubation box covering the objectives and the microscope stage is helpful, yet not essential for temperature control. The temperature of the incubation box is set to the highest temperature used in the experiment, e.g. , to 40 °C if heat stress is performed. Otherwise, the temperature is set to 25 °C. Temperature changes should be made in advance to allow the system to adapt, as changes in temperature during imaging can affect the focus. NOTE: During imaging, the temperature is controlled using a cooling chamber. The default temperature for imaging non-stressed cells is 23 °C. For heat stress conditions, the temperature is increased accordingly to the desired level. The piezo element in the cooling chamber can respond very quickly to the temperature shift. However, the focus of the images will change slightly (it can deviate to up to 20 µm depending on the temperature shift). Thus manual refocusing is required within the first minutes of image acquisition, unless the used microscope is equipped with a hardware auto-focus. Image acquisition under non-stressed conditions Image cells under non-stressed conditions at 23 °C, acquire a minimum of 6 fields of view (FOVs). NOTE: Non-stress condition can be visualized either by recording a short time-lapse (5-30 min) or acquisition of representative stills. For each condition or cell line acquire a minimum of 6 fields of view (FOVs). NOTE: In case individual cells are of interest, position the respective cells in the middle of the FOV and record a 3 x 3 tile series with the FOV containing the cells of interest in the middle. D. discoideum cells are motile and might migrate out of the FOV. However, the 3 x 3 tile series increases the area potentially explored by the cell of interest and it remains traceable for time-lapse periods of ~6 hr. Acquire z-stacks of maximum 7 µm in 1-0.25 µm steps to capture the whole volume of the cell. Acquire a reference bright field image to assess the total number of cells. Image acquisition for heat stress Adjust the temperature of the cooling chamber to 30 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the temperature display has reached the desired value, refocus manually in the bright field channel and check all recorded FOVs before starting the time-lapse. Start a time-lapse for 4 hr of heat stress with a time interval of 5-10 min between time points. Check for correct focusing during the acquisition of the first two time points. Image acquisition during recovery After heat stress, reduce the temperature back to 23 °C, wait for the temperature display to adjust and refocus manually. Record time-lapse movies in the recovery phase for 8-10 hr in 10-20 min time intervals. Check for correct focusing during the acquisition of the first time point. 3. Image Analysis NOTE: To quantify the number of cells harboring cytosolic foci, assess the total number of cells and the number of cells with cytosolic foci in each time frame. Due to the difficulty of segmenting cells from bright field images, the quantification needs to be done manually. In the following, data analysis is described for the free image processing package ((http://fiji.sc/Fiji). It requires the plugin “Cell Counter” (http://fiji.sc/Cell_Counter). Assessing total number of cells Load the bright field image stack (XYT) by clicking \"File\" and \"Open\". Open the \"Cell Counter\" plugin (\"Plugins\" -\"Cell Counter\"). Load the image stack by clicking \"Initialize\". Choose the appropriate type of counters by ticking the appropriate box. NOTE: use type 1 as counter for total number of cells and type 2 as counter for cells with cytosolic foci. Count all cells. Save the markers by clicking \"Save Markers\". Assessing the number of cells with cytosolic foci Load the fluorescence image hyperstack (XZYT) (\"File\" - \"Open\") and make a maximum intensity projection using the \"Z-Projector\" (Image/Stacks). Open the \"Cell Counter\" plugin. Load the resulting image stack (XYT) by clicking \"Initialize\". Load the markers by clicking \"Load Markers\". CAUTION: The file names of the reference image and the fluorescence stack must be identical. If necessary, rename accordingly before initializing the image stack. Choose the appropriate marker type (see 3.1.3) and count cells with cytosolic foci. The existing markers can be used as guidance for the position of individual cells. Retrieve the number of counts per slice by clicking on \"Results\" and save the counts elsewhere for further calculations.",

    "title": "Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analysis of ribosome-nascent chain complexes to study protein biogenesis at the peptide level.",
    "abstract": "Nascent proteins begin to fold during their synthesis, while still attached to the ribosome. The dynamic nature of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) poses a challenge for conventional structural biology approaches, limiting our understanding of dynamic cotranslational events. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a powerful label-free technique for studying the conformational equilibria and refolding of full-length proteins with peptide resolution. However, the large size of the ribosome and the need for stable, highly homogeneous samples have hindered the application of HDX-MS to RNCs. Here we present a strategy for analysing conformational dynamics and interactors of Escherichia coli RNCs using HDX-MS. High-quality RNCs are obtained through the gentle lysis of high-density cultures expressing uniformly stalled ribosomes, followed by ultracentrifugation and tag-based affinity purification. Peptide-resolution information on protein conformational dynamics is obtained by pulse deuterium labeling, quenching with an RNA-compatible low pH buffer and offline digestion with pepsin. Extensive data analysis with use of specific internal controls allows for the confident assignment of mass spectra to specific peptides, ensuring good coverage of the nascent chain and ribosomal proteins. This method provides a valuable complement to existing structural techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance, and enables detailed characterization of large, partially structured nascent chains and their interactions with the ribosomal proteins and molecular chaperones.

CH184 harbors a hyper-accurate ribosome mutant with a much slower translation elongation speed than wild type strain. AS19 strain is permeable to fusidic acid. Construction of pKUT15 series vectors The pKUT15 vector is derived from a very low-copy plasmid pZS24*MCS (SC101* replicon). The lacZα fragment (N-terminal residues 1–60 of LacZ) was PCR amplified and inserted into the KpnI/MluI site of pZS24*MCS plasmid, yielding pZS24*-LacZα. The long upstream primer of lacZα fragment also contains a sequence coding for (GGGGS) 2 linker so that the linker coding sequence was in frame fused with LacZα fragment. The native lac promoter (−200 bp to −6 bp relative to the lacZ transcription starting point) was amplified from the genome of MG1655 strain and cloned into the HindIII/KpnI sites of pZS24*-LacZα to replace the native Plac/ara-1 promoter, this yields pZS24*-Plac-LacZα. The coding sequence of lacZω fragment was amplified from the genome of E. coli Top10 strain and cloned into the KpnI/BamHI sites of pZA31-luc, thus being under the control of Ptet promoter, yielding pZA31- lacZω . The fragment containing Ptet-lacZω -T 1 (T 1 terminator) was further PCR amplified from pZA31- lacZω and cloned into the SalI/HindIII sites of pZS24*-Plac-LacZα. Finally using point mutation, a pair of XhoI/NotI sites were introduced between the transcription site of native lac promoter and (GGGGS) 2 linker coding sequence to facilitate the fusion between target genes and lacZα . This finally yields pKUT15 vector. For the measurement of translation elongation speed, fusA, tufA genes were PCR amplified with MG1655 genome as template, while the bla was amplified with plasmid pBR322 as template. The fragments of these three genes were finally inserted into the XhoI/NotI sites of pKUT15 to be in frame fused with lacZα . Construction of LacZ-deficient strain To measure translation elongation speed using our LacZα complementation system, we need to transform the pKUT15 series vectors to a LacZ-deficient strain. Strain JW0332 ( ΔcynX782::kan, ΔlacZ4787 (::rrnB-3) ) was obtained from the coli genetic stock center (CGSC, Yale university). This strain carries a ΔcynX782::kan mutation, which is adjacent to the lac operon. Deletion of the cynX gene causes no phenotype defect. Moreover, this strain is LacZ deficient due to carrying the ΔlacZ4787 (::rrnB-3) allele which has the start codon of lac operon removed. Allele of ΔcynX782::kan, ΔlacZ4787 (::rrnB-3) was transferred to all the three strains, MG1655, CH184 and AS19 through P1 transduction to obtain their LacZ-deficient counterparts. The ka n R gene was then flipped out using pCP20 plasmid. pKUT15 series vectors were then transformed to the LacZ-deficient strains for measurement of translation elongation speed. Medium The growth medium used in this study is MOPS buffered minimal medium described at Neidhardt et al. ( 12 ). For minimal medium, carbons were used as below: 0.2% (w/v) glucose (for starvation experiment 0.05% and 0.4% were used), 0.2% (w/v) fructose. In addition, rich defined medium (RDM) contains 0.2% (w/v) glucose, various amino acids, nucleotides, micronutrients, and vitamins as described in Neidhardt et al. Glucose + cAA medium contains 0.2% (w/v) glucose and 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids. For all the above media, 10 mM NH 4 Cl (for starvation assay, 4 mM and 15 mM were used) was supplied as nitrogen source. Cell growth Cell growth was always performed in an air bath shaker (25°C or 37°C) shaking at 240 rpm. Cell growth always contained three steps, seed culture in LB broth, pre-culture and experimental culture in MOPS minimal medium. For seed culture, cells from a fresh solid LB plate was inoculated into LB liquid medium and cultured at 37°C. After several hours, cells were centrifuged and washed with fresh MOPS minimal medium, and then inoculated into the same MOPS minimal medium for overnight growth (at 25°C or 37°C) as pre-culture. In the next day, pre-culture was diluted into identical fresh MOPS minimal medium starting from OD 600 around 0.01–0.02 as experimental culture. About 6–10 OD 600 data points within the range of ∼0.05 and ∼0.5 were taken for calculating the growth rate. At OD 600 around 0.4 or 0.5, cell samples were taken for translation elongation speed measurement. For all the cells harboring pKUT15 series vectors, 30 μg/mL kanamycin was always supplied into the culture. Measurement of translation elongation speed The basic principle is similar with the classical LacZ induction assay as described in Andersson et al. ( 13 ). E. coli cells harboring pKUT15 series vectors were grown to OD 600 around 0.4 to 0.5 (for ammonia starvation study, the OD 600 finally reached 0.7), 5 mM IPTG was added to the culture to induce the expression the lacZα fused gene in the pKUT15 vector. At a time interval of 5–15 s (this depends on the translation elongation speed, can be 5, 10 or 15 s), around 15–20 cell samples (1 ml each) were immediately pipetted into pre-chilled eppendorf tubes containing 10 μl chloramphenicol (34 mg/ml) for blocking further translation and then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C before measurement. Then before LacZ activity measurement, cell samples were incubated at 37°C water bath for 1 hour to allow the new synthesized LacZα fragment to totally complement with LacZ ω fragment. The LacZ activity of cell samples was measured using a sensitive fluorescence substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-D-galactopyranoside (MUG) ( 14 , 15 ). 400 μL cell sample was added to 100 μl five X Z-buffer and pre-warmed at 37°C water bath for 10 min. 100 μl MUG stock (4 mg/ml) was then added and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 0.5–2 h. The reaction was then stopped by 300 μl 1 M Na 2 CO 3 . The fluorescence intensity was measured with a micro-plate reader (365 nm excitation filter, 450 nm emission filter). Calibration of the time cost of the initiation step (T init ) To calibrate the time cost of the initiation steps (including the IPTG penetration, LacI de-repression, RNA polymerase transcription initiation, and ribosome translation initiation), a control pKUT15 vector with only LacZα fragment (no other genes fused) was used to obtain the induction kinetic of the 70 aa LacZα fragment (containing 10 aa linker) for all the growth conditions studied in this work. The synthesis time of the LacZα fragment (T α ) was estimated using the straight-line fit of the induction kinetics data. For the same conditions, the synthesis time of Protein A-LacZα fused protein (T A ) was also obtained. The time cost of the initiation step (T init ) equals to T α − 70/ [L A / (T A − T α )] (L A means the length of A protein).\n\nMethod establishment A low-copy vector called pKUT15 was constructed for this method (Figure 1A ). This vector contains a lacZα fragment (coding for the N-terminal residues 1–60 of LacZ) driven by the native lac promoter. A pair of XhoI and NotI sites was placed downstream of the lac promoter where the target gene can be inserted and be fused in frame with the lacZα fragment by a (GGGGS) 2 linker to guarantee its freedom ( 16 , 17 ). Moreover, the vector also contains a lacZω fragment driven by a constitutive Ptet promoter. To test our system, we chose three target genes, fusA, tufA and bla , whose translation elongation speeds under some conditions were available ( 6 , 18 ). The lacZ gene in the wild type cell was further inactivated before using this vector. Figure 1. ( A ) pKUT15 vector designed for measuring translation elongation speed. ( B ) Induction kinetics of FusA-LacZα protein. Cells were grown in glucose + cAA medium at 37°C. ( C ) Schleif plot of FusA-LacZα induction kinetics in panel (B). The square root of the newly synthesized enzyme was plotted against the induction time. The X intercept, which is 58.7 s in this condition, denotes the translation time of the FusA-LacZα protein (T fusA ). ( D ) Calibration of the time cost of initiation steps (T init ) by measuring the induction kinetics of the empty LacZα fragment (with no target gene fused). MG1655 cells harboring the empty LacZα were grown in glucose + cAA medium (same as panel B and panel C) and the induction kinetic of the empty LacZα was also measured. The T init was found to be always around 10 s (Supplementary Figure S6). Therefore, the translation elongation time of the FusA-LacZα protein (panel C) is 48.7 s. The length of FusA-LacZα is 774 aa so the translation elongation speed is 774/48.7 = 15.9 aa/s. Steady-state growth of E. coli MG1655 strain harboring the pKUT15 vector was almost unaffected compared to that of the control strain under all the testing conditions (Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting that the very low-copy pKUT15 vector did not cause obvious physiological burden for E. coli . When IPTG was added to exponentially growing cultures of the E. coli strain harboring pKUT15, synthesis of the LacZα fused protein was induced. The newly synthesized fused protein complemented with the existing excess amount of LacZ ω fragment (Supplementary Figure S4) to yield LacZ activity (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, we obtained the induction kinetics of the fused proteins (Figure 1B , Supplementary Figure S5A and C). Moreover, the exact translation time of the first fused proteins was also obtained by using the ‘Schleif plot’ as in the case of the classical LacZ induction assay ( 7 ) (Figure 1C , Supplementary Figure S1, and Figure S5B and D). The time cost of initiation steps (T init ) including the IPTG penetration, LacI de-repression, RNA polymerase transcription initiation and ribosome translation initiation, which is ignored in classical LacZ induction assay (Supplementary Figure S1), is addressed by repeating the induction kinetic of the empty LacZα fragment without target proteins fused (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S6). For example, as shown in Figure 1D , the synthesis time of LacZα (T α ) in glucose + cAA medium at 37°C was 14 s. At the same conditions, the synthesis time of FusA-LacZα protein (T fusA ) was 58.7 s. Therefore, T init equals to T α -70/ [704/ (T fusA -T α )] (The length of FusA protein is 704 aa), so we can obtain that T init equals to 9.6 s. Using this strategy, we found that the initiation steps always took around 10 s in all our test conditions (Supplementary Figure S6). Therefore, the translation elongation speed was obtained easily by using the length of the LacZα fused protein to divide its translation elongation time (caption of Figure 1 , Supplementary Figure S6, and Table S1). The error bars of different rounds of experiments were within 10% (Supplementary Figure S7).\n\nMethod tests in various conditions Several rounds of tests were performed to validate this method. We first studied the translation elongation speed of MG1655 strain upon nutrient limitation at 37°C. We took FusA-LacZα (774 aa) protein as the example. Cells were grown in MOPS minimal medium supplemented with different nutrient sources to achieve different growth rates. The result clearly showed that the translation elongation speed is growth-rate dependent upon nutrient limitation. Translation elongation speed saturated at around 16–17 aa/s at fast growth (GR > 1/h), but decreased at slower growth (Figure 2 ). This is consistent with the results of several previous sporadic studies at similar growth range using other methods ( 6 , 8 , 19 ) (Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Translation elongation speed of MG1655 upon nutrient limitation at 37°C (Red open circles). The studied protein was FusA-LacZα. Data points were plotted together with previous results conducted at similar growth range. When E. coli grows at low temperatures, both its growth rate and translation elongation speed substantially drop in proportion to each other ( 20 ). The translation elongation speeds of all the three genes, fusA-lacZα, tufA-lacZα , and bla-lacZα were measured at 25°C using our method. The growth rates at 25°C were always only one third of those at 37°C. Strikingly, translation elongation speeds of all the three proteins were around four to six aa/s, which were also only about one third of those at 37°C (Table 1 , Supplementary Figure S8, and Table S1). This is in good agreement with the results of previous studies on the slow-down of translation elongation at low temperatures ( 6 ). Moreover, similar as previous studies ( 6 , 18 ), bla is always translated at a lower speed than fusA and tufA , which may be due to its higher content of rare codons ( 6 ). Table 1. Effect of temperature on translation elongation speed medium Translation elongation speed c (aa/s) fusA-lacZα tufA-lacZα bla-lacZα 37°C 25°C 37°C 25°C 37°C 25°C Glucose + cAA a 15.9 6.0 16.2 5.8 13.6 4.2 Glucose b 14.4 5.4 13.9 5.0 11.9 4.1 a Growth rates in glucose+cAA medium at 37°C and 25°C were 1 h -1 and 0.34 h -1 , respectively. b Growth rates in glucose medium at 37°C and 25°C were 0.65 h -1 and 0.2 h -1 , respectively. c Measurements were repeated for three times and deviations were within 10%. To further validate our system, we measured the translation elongation speed of a translation mutant strain CH184. CH184 is a streptomycin pseudo-dependent strain (SmP) ( 10 , 21 ). It harbors a hyper-accurate mutant ribosome that translates much more slowly than normal ribosome. Translation elongation speeds were around 4–5 aa/s by using our method (Table 2 ). Moreover, the addition of 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Str), which reduces the proofreading cost of the mutant ribosome, stimulated both the growth rate and translation elongation speed by two-fold (Table 2 , Supplementary Figure S9). This quantitatively reproduced existing data of the translation elongation speed of the SmP strain (Table 2 ) ( 10 ). This is also consistent with the value of LacZ protein at the same growth condition after initiation time calibration (Supplementary Figure S9D). Table 2. Translation elongation speed of CH184 strain upon Streptomycin (Str) treatment and AS19 strain upon Fusidic acid (FA) treatment Strain Translation elongation speed c (aa/s) fusA-lacZα tufA-lacZα bla-lacZα CH184 (SmP) a + Str - Str + Str - Str + Str - Str 10.1 5.4 10.5 5.0 8.4 4.5 AS19 b +FA -FA +FA -FA +FA -FA 8.9 16.4 8.1 16.1 6.1 13.6 a Grow rate of CH184 (harboring each of the three fused proteins) in glucose+cAA medium with and without 100 μg/ml Str were 0.86 h -1 and 0.44 h -1 , respectively. The translation elongation speeds of the SmP strain were 5 aa/s and 11 aa/s for growth without and with 100 μg/ml Str respectively in Ruusala et al 15 , which quantitatively agrees with our results. b Growth rates of AS19 (harboring each of the three fused proteins) in glucose medium with and without 1 μg/ml FA were 0.3 h -1 and 0.97 h -1 , respectively. c Measurements were repeated for three times and deviations were within 10%. Fusidic acid (FA), a protein synthesis inhibitor, which prevents the turnover of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome, was also found to cause substantial slow-down of translation ( 11 ). This was again captured by our method. Using a B/r derived AS19 strain ( 11 ), which is permeable to fusidic acid, our method showed that 1 μg/ml of fusidic acid (sublethal dose), which reduces the growth rate by three-fold, caused a two-fold decrease in the translation elongation speed (Table 2 , Supplementary Figure S10).\n\nSupplementary Material SUPPLEMENTARY DATA",

    "title": "Preparation and Negative Staining for Visualization of Cyanoglobule Lipid Droplets Using Transmission Electron Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Lipid droplets have emerged as dynamic organelles involved in diverse cellular processes beyond simple lipid storage. In plants and cyanobacteria, growing evidence highlights their importance in stress adaptation and signaling, yet methods to study their structure and purity remain limited. Traditionally, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to visualize lipid droplets within intact cells. While powerful, this approach cannot easily evaluate isolated lipid droplets or confirm their purity. In this protocol, we describe a rapid method for preparing and visualizing cyanoglobule lipid droplets isolated from cyanobacteria. The isolated droplets are directly processed for TEM using negative staining with uranyl acetate, providing a straightforward and efficient workflow. The procedure can be applied broadly to lipid droplets from diverse organisms, independent of species or cellular origin. This protocol offers a simple, fast, and widely applicable approach to assessing lipid droplets, expanding the toolkit for researchers studying their structure and function. Key features • Provides a brief and detailed method to visualize cyanoglobule lipid droplets. • Offers a rapid workflow (~1-2 h from preparation to imaging), enabling efficient sample processing and high-throughput analysis. • Employs negative staining and TEM to directly assess droplet morphology and purity without complex sample preparation. • Applicable to isolated lipid droplets from diverse organisms, making it a broadly useful tool beyond cyanobacteria.",

Filter paper (VWR, catalog number: 470201-456)\n\nProcedure A. Sample preparation and negative staining with uranyl acetate 1. The isolated fraction of cyanoglobules obtained from sucrose gradient purification [17] is used for direct staining and visualization. 2. Mix 180 μL of sample with 500 μL of 1% (w/v) OsO 4 inside a fume hood. Incubate for 10 min. Although droplets are already isolated, osmium tetroxide serves as a secondary fixative that stabilizes and contrasts unsaturated lipid components, preserving their structural integrity for TEM visualization. 3. Place a piece of Parafilm in a Petri dish. Arrange Formvar-coated copper grids on top of the Parafilm, shiny side facing up. 4. Pipette 20 μL of cyanoglobule sample onto each grid and incubate for 20 min. Cover the Petri dish with its lid during incubation. 5. Blot excess liquid from the back side of the grid using filter paper, ensuring the sample remains on the grid surface. 6. Prepare the negative staining setup as shown in Figure 1 , with one drop of 1% uranyl acetate and three drops of HPLC-grade water (200 μL each). Figure 1. Setup configuration for negative staining. A Petri dish lined with Parafilm holds one drop of uranyl acetate (for staining) and three drops of HPLC-grade water (for sequential washes). Sample grids are incubated on the Parafilm surface. 7. Transfer the dried sample grid into the drop of 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 20 s using anti-capillary forceps (handle the grid carefully to avoid film damage). 8. Sequentially wash the grid by transferring it into the three drops of HPLC-grade water (30 s per drop). 9. Blot the grid dry from the edge using filter paper held at a ~45° angle, using the dull side to wick away excess liquid. 10. Allow the grid to fully air-dry. Once dry, the grid is ready for imaging. B. Data collection (imaging cyanoglobules) 1. Grid mounting a. Using clean anti-capillary forceps, gently pick up a stained copper grid by the edge. b. Place the grid into the TEM specimen holder, ensuring the carbon-coated side is facing the electron beam. c. Lock the holder securely before insertion. 2. Inserting the grid holder a. Carefully insert the holder into the JEM-1400 Flash goniometer stage. b. Engage the vacuum interlock sequence following instrument instructions. c. Wait until the system confirms that the specimen chamber has reached operating vacuum. 3. Initial microscope setup a. Switch to low magnification (e.g., 1,000×) to locate the grid square and ensure proper alignment. b. Adjust condenser lens aperture and illumination for even contrast. c. Center and focus the beam over an area of interest. 4. Imaging at higher magnification a. Gradually increase magnification (e.g., 10,000× to 30,000×) to visualize lipid droplets. b. Adjust focus, astigmatism correction, and contrast for clarity. c. Use a low-dose imaging mode to minimize beam-induced damage and droplet collapse (recommended beam current ≤ 10 μA and dose rate < 5 e-·Å -2 ·s -1 ). d. Optimize the electron beam to avoid grid damage. 5. Image acquisition a. Open TEM Center software on the acquisition workstation. b. Capture live images using the sCMOS camera. c. Adjust exposure time, gain, and binning settings for optimal resolution. d. Save images in TIFF format for high-quality analysis, and optionally in JPEG/PNG for quick viewing. TIFF image acquisition is compulsory for accurate downstream processing and quantitative analysis (preserves full image fidelity and metadata). For larger experiments, users should anticipate that a typical session may require tens to hundreds of gigabytes of disk space, depending on magnification and exposure settings. A workstation equipped with at least 32 GB RAM, a multi-core CPU, and a dedicated GPU are recommended for smooth image acquisition and post-processing. 6. Documentation: Note grid ID and sample details for traceability. 7. Finishing up a. Once imaging is complete, return to low magnification and move to an empty grid square. b. Remove the specimen holder following the JEOL shutdown procedure. c. Store imaged grids in a labeled grid box for future reference.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol, or parts of it, has been used and validated in the following research articles: 1. Cyanoglobules staining: Susanto et al. [16]. Cyanoglobule lipid droplets are a stress-responsive metabolic compartment of cyanobacteria and the progenitor of plant plastoglobules (Figure 3C, Supplementary Figure S8). 2. Maize plastoglobules staining: Devadasu et al. [18]. Dynamic changes to the plastoglobule lipidome and proteome in maize during heat stress and recovery (Figure 4B). 3.

    "title": "Rapid Miniprep of Intact Chloroplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana Leaves.",
    "abstract": "Cell subfractionation is a common technique employed in many research laboratories to isolate organelles or intracellular compartments for the study of metabolism or biomolecule purification. While numerous protocols exist for isolating organelles, few are specifically designed for starting materials in the milligram range. Here, we present a detailed milligram-scale miniprep protocol for purifying intact chloroplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. This chloroplast miniprep procedure is suitable for applications such as confocal microscopy, western blotting, enzymatic assays, and other downstream analyses. Key features • This protocol condenses key aspects of existing methods and adapts them to the miniprep scale. • Researchers can isolate purified chloroplasts within 1.5 h. • This protocol requires standard laboratory equipment, such as microcentrifuges (ultracentrifuges are not required).

Miracloth (Merck, catalog number: 475855)\n\nProcedure Isolated chloroplasts can be obtained from either cotyledons or true leaves. However, to achieve the desired yields, sufficient initial biological material is required [10]. Reagents such as agar, MS medium, bleach, Tween 20, Hoagland solution, and substrate components (e.g., Sunshine Mix 3, perlite) are included in the materials list as they are used for seed sterilization, stratification, and plant cultivation steps prior to chloroplast isolation, following previously described procedures [11]. This protocol is designed to extract chloroplasts from a minimum of 0.3 g of starting material, making it more practical to use 4-week-old plants grown under standard conditions (16/8h light/dark, 22 °C, ~100–150μmol·m -2 ·s -1 light intensity) rather than younger seedlings. If seedlings are chosen, it will be necessary to germinate many seeds to obtain the minimal mass required for this method to be effective. Conversely, working with leaves from mature plants will simplify this protocol as it will result in higher yields. We recommend 0.5 g of starting material to achieve good yields. A. Percoll gradient generation and chloroplast isolation (time for completion: 1.5 h) 1. Ensure the leaves, buffers, and materials are kept below 4 °C during the process. 2. Generate a Percoll gradient by centrifuging 0.9 mL of Percoll and 0.1 mL of 2.5 M sucrose in an Eppendorf tube at 16,000× g for 30 min. Use soft braking, if possible, to avoid disturbing the gradient. 3. Cut and weigh ~0.3–0.5 g of true leaves out of the desired plants. 4. Grind leaves in 1 mL of ice-cold CI buffer per 0.1 g of leaf tissue using an ice-cold mini ceramic mortar. Critical: Make sure leaf tissue is thoroughly homogenized (15–20 pestle passes should suffice for 0.5 g). On the other hand, excessive homogenization can yield broken chloroplasts. Optional: If the samples require gentler homogenization, Teflon pellet pestles can be used to lyse leaf cells within Eppendorf tubes. 5. Filter the homogenate through a funnel using a 3 cm × 3 cm piece of Miracloth premoistened with CI buffer and distribute evenly into clean, prechilled Eppendorf tubes ( Figure 1 ). Optional: If Miracloth is not available, filtering can be achieved with Muslin cloth, nylon mesh filters, or four layers of cheesecloth. Figure 1. Chloroplast homogenization, filtering, Percoll gradient separation, and yield determination. (A) Suggested extent of homogenization. (B) Homogenate filtration using a prechilled Miracloth with buffer to prevent organelle degradation. (C) After centrifugation in a tube with a preformed Percoll gradient, two green bands should form, with cell debris collected in the pellet. The band in the middle indicates intact chloroplasts (green arrow), the upper band corresponds to broken chloroplasts (yellow arrow), and cell debris is collected at the bottom of the tube (red arrow). (D) Once intact chloroplasts are resuspended and washed, the isolation yield can be determined using an improved Neubauer chamber. Scale bar represents 100 μm. 6. Spin samples at 3,000× g for 8 min at 4 °C. 7. Remove the supernatant using a pipette or by applying vacuum through a vacuum line connected to a pipette tip. 8. Resuspend the pellet (crude chloroplasts) in 0.3 mL of cold CI buffer. 9. Carefully pipette the crude preparation and layer it onto the Percoll gradient. 10. Spin samples at 3,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. 11. Two green bands should form afterward ( Figure 1B ). The lower band corresponds to the intact chloroplast samples ( Figure 1B , green arrow). 12. Carefully remove the lower band with the aid of a pipette. 13. Place the samples into a new Eppendorf tube. 14. Add CI buffer to a final volume of 1 mL. 15. Spin samples at 3,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. 16. Remove supernatant using a pipette or by applying vacuum through a vacuum line connected to a pipette tip. 17. Resuspend the pellet in ice-cold CI buffer to a final volume of 1mL. 18. Count chloroplasts with a Newbauer chamber to determine isolation yield. Pause point: Samples can be either stored at 4 °C for a few hours or used for downstream applications (see troubleshooting). 19. Purified chloroplasts can be readily used for microscopy, western blotting, enzyme assays, or purification, among other biochemical or molecular procedures.\n\nValidation of protocol Purified chloroplasts can be readily assessed under the microscope at 20–40×. These organelles appear as green disk-shaped organelles and can be counted with the aid of a Neubauer chamber ( Figure 1D ). In our hands, a typical yield of 1–2 × 10 6 chloroplasts per gram of fresh leaf tissue is attained with this protocol, depending on the extent of homogenization and the recovery of intact chloroplasts from the Percoll gradient. Alternatively, organellar protein concentration for western blotting or other applications can be assessed spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Typical sample purity assessments include either western blotting against organellar or cytoplasmic proteins ( Figure 2A ) or assessing chloroplast structure and morphology using confocal microscopy approaches ( Figure 2B ). Figure 2. Validation of chloroplast fraction purity and structure. (A) The fractions obtained during chloroplast purification, including whole lysate, cytoplasmic (Cyto), and chloroplast (Chloro) fractions, can be assessed for protein markers such as Actin or PsaB to detect cytoplasmic or chloroplast-specific markers, respectively. (B) Chlorophyll autofluorescence of an isolated chloroplast Z-slice as viewed under the confocal microscope at 63× using light at 400nm ex /685nm em . Starch granules appear as dark spots. Scale bar represents 5 μm. Representative experiments n = 3. Under these conditions, it is possible to determine the lack of contaminating actin on fractions containing purified chloroplasts, while the core subunit of photosystem I (PsaB) is enriched in the same fractions ( Figure 2A ). Contamination from other organelles (i.e., mitochondria) is typically absent.",

    "title": "Standardized Flow Cytometry Method for Absolute Counting of Intraepithelial Lymphocytes in the Intestinal Mucosa Using TruCountTM Beads.",
    "abstract": "In the intestinal epithelium, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) coexist with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The IELs have an important role in defending the intestinal tract against pathogens and eliminating tumor cells. Anomalies in the absolute IEL count have been reported in various digestive diseases. IELs are typically counted using histologic techniques or under light microscopy after isolation of the epithelium. However, these techniques can introduce bias, which might account for the discrepancies in counts from one study to another. Here, we describe a flow cytometry assay for determining the absolute IEL count and the IEL/IEC ratio. We combined a conventional epithelial isolation method with a BD TruCountTM bead-based absolute counting technique to quantify IELs (CD45+ CD326/EpCAM- CD103+CD3+) and IECs (CD45- CD326/EpCAM+) in a C57BL/6 mouse model. Key features • Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) play a crucial role in maintaining mucosal integrity and defending against pathogens. • Conventional manual counting of IELs using a hemocytometer relies heavily on the operator's expertise. • Flow cytometry offers a more standardized approach to cell counting. • Using TruCountTM beads to quantify IELs and intraepithelial cells (IECs) by flow cytometry and assess their ratio ensures reproducibility and comparison with immunohistochemical methods.

Recovery of the different parts of the intestine from the mouse abdomen (see Video 1 ) Video 1. Isolation of the intestinal epithelial layer from mice 1. Euthanize the mice by exposition to CO 2 or by cervical dislocation in line with your institution's guidelines. 2. Place the mouse on its back on a dissection table and attach its four legs with syringe needles. 3. Spray the mouse's ventral side with 70% ethanol. 4. Using curved forceps, grab and cut the skin and peritoneum. 5. Free the viscera by opening the peritoneum until the lungs appear. 6. Extend the incision to the right and left groin to provide better access to the intestine. 7. Hook the peritoneum and the open skin on either side of the mouse with needles. 8. Locate the stomach, catch hold of the duodenum, and cut it at the base of the pylorus with flat scissors. 9. Pull progressively to unwind the whole intestine and do not hesitate to cut the mesenteries if they hang too much. 10. Once the whole digestive tract has been unwound, cut at the base of the colon (as close as possible to the anus). 11. Place the digestive tract on another dissection table. 12. Critical step : Spray the entire tissue using fresh complete medium. Do not let the tissue dry out for the rest of the protocol, and do not hesitate to moisten the intestinal tissue several times to avoid any cell stress that may influence cell viability or function. 13. Remove any mesenteries attached to the intestine, using curved tweezers. 14. Remove the Peyer's patches from the entire small intestine by using curved forceps to catch hold of them and then curved scissors to remove them from the digestive tract. 15. Using a scalpel, cut out the intestinal part of interest (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) ( Figure 1 ). 16. Using a scalpel, cut each resected intestinal part into two (duodenum, jejunum, colon) or three (ileum) equal pieces. 17. Holding each resected intestinal part at one end with noncurved forceps, empty its contents by pressing it with curved forceps and gradually pushing the contents toward the other end of the tissue. 18. Critical step : Using a scalpel, carefully open the necessary sections of the intestinal tract lengthwise—either the entire tract or only the region of interest—to expose the inner lining for epithelial recovery. 19. Weigh the various tissues before depositing them in complete medium. Figure 1. Representative picture of the different segments of the murine intestinal tract. The duodenum (purple segment) represents the first 5 cm of the intestine after the stomach. The jejunum (green segment) is the intestinal segment between the duodenum and the ileum. The ileum (blue segment) corresponds to the 18 cm preceding the cecum. The colon (black segment) corresponds to the intestinal segment that follows directly after the cecum to the anus. B. Recovery of epithelium 1. Add the appropriate volume of S1 (5 mL for the duodenum, jejunum, and colon and 10 mL for the ileum) to a 50 ml Falcon tube containing that part of the intestine. 2. Shake at 180 rpm and 37 °C for 8 min. 3. Filter each portion through a 70 µm filter. Recover the tissue with a pair of tweezers and discard the filtrate. 4. Add the appropriate volume of S2 (5 mL for the duodenum, jejunum, and colon and 10 mL for the ileum) to each gut section. 5. Shake at 180 rpm and 37 °C for 8 min. 6. Vortex vigorously and collect the S2 filtered through a 100 µm filter and containing the epithelium in another 50 mL tube. 7. Repeat steps B4–6 twice on the same epithelium collection tube. 8. Keep the tubes containing the epithelium from the different parts of the intestine on ice and discard any remaining tissue. C. Flow cytometry staining protocol 1. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 800× g for 5 min at 4 °C. 2. Discard the supernatant (alternatively, the supernatant can be removed by inversion of the tube while taking care not to disperse the pellet) and suspend the whole cells in PBS (final volume 2 mL). 3. Aliquot 250 µL of cell suspension into a 96-well plate. 4. Centrifuge the plate at 800× g for 1 min at 4 °C. 5. Discard the supernatant and wash with 200 µL of FACS buffer using a multichannel pipette. 6. Centrifuge the plate at 800× g for 1 min at 4 °C. 7. Discard the supernatant and add 30 µL of antibodies mixture ( Table 1 ) for extracellular labeling in FACS buffer. 8. Incubate at 4 °C in the dark for 30 min. 9. Centrifuge the plate at 800× g for 1 min at 4 °C. 10. Discard the supernatant and add 50 µL of FACS buffer using a multichannel pipette. D. Setting up the FACS acquisition stage 1. Ensure that daily cytometer calibration is carried out by the instrument's technical manager. This calibration is carried out using Sphero TM Rainbow Calibration Particles (6 peaks) (BD bioscience). This quality control is generally under the responsibility of your flow cytometry core facility. 2. Make sure you have prepared the appropriate controls: a. Unstained tube, which only contains the cells. b. Single-stained tubes: for each fluorochrome used in the experiment (see Table 1 ), a single-stained cell sample must be prepared and used as compensation control. Indeed, in multicolor flow cytometry experiments, compensation controls are critical for the avoidance of spectral overlaps between fluorophores. c. Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls, which contain the cells stained with all but one of the antibodies/fluorochromes. In the case of this experiment, five FMO tubes are required. These controls are important when identifying a positive in a negative population and when the expression levels are low (see Figure 1 ). 3. Optimize acquisition parameters: FSC, SSC, fluorescence channels, and compensation (for more details, see Supplementary materials). E. Flow cytometry data acquisition 1. Add 450 µL of FACS buffer to the BD TruCount TM tubes. 2. Resuspend stained cells in 50 µL and add them to the BD TruCount TM tubes. Note: TruCount TM beads are microparticles of a known size, each containing a fluorescent dye. They are added to the cell sample in precise and uniform quantities. These beads, which have the same fluorescence characteristics as the cells, are counted simultaneously with the cells. As the sample flows through the cytometer, each particle (whether a cell or bead) is individually analyzed based on size, fluorescence, and other distinguishing features. The cytometer counts both cells and beads. By knowing the exact number of beads added and the total count of particles (cells + beads), the number of cells in the sample can be accurately calculated according to an established formula. 3. Vortex the tubes for 15 s and wait 15 min. 4. Add the appropriate volume of DAPI ( Table 1 ) to achieve a dilution of 1:1,000. Wait 5 min before starting the acquisition. 5. Vortex the tubes just before the acquisition. 6. Acquire a total of 10,000 beads per sample in the flow cytometer.\n\nValidation of protocol As stated in the introduction, we started our experiments by comparing two types of commonly used viability markers: the nuclear DNA probe DAPI and the cellular protein probe Zombie. We found that the Zombie probe gave false positives because it bounds to the mucus adhering to epithelial cells ( Figure 3C , lower panel). Indeed, Zombie marker binds to the amino residues of mucin glycoproteins that constitute mucus. This led to an underestimation of the epithelial cell count ( Figure 3D , lower panel) and thus to a significant overestimation of the IEL/IEC ratio, relative to the DAPI condition and conventional counting (the reference method) using a hemocytometer ( Figure 3F ). Hence, the use of DNA-based viability probes like DAPI as cell viability markers in this setting is a critical point in the present protocol. Figure 3. Comparison of intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) counts, using two different viability probes. (A–E) The gating strategy for IELs and IECs (see Figure 2 legend) used either the DAPI viability marker (upper panels) or the Zombie dye (lower panels). Arrows indicate the population selected for the next step in the gating strategy. The percentage of the selected population is shown in each graph. (F) Histograms depicting the IEL/IEC ratio were derived from the flow cytometry data (applied to the ileum) and from cell counting with a hemocytometer (the reference method). n=5; each symbol corresponds to an individual mouse. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Wilcoxon test; ** p < 0.01.\n\nSupplementary information The following supporting information can be downloaded here : 1.

Indeed, the light scattered by cells is measured by two optical detectors: forward scatter (FSC), which detects scatter along the path of the laser, and side scatter (SSC), which measures scatter at a 90° angle relative to the laser. FSC intensity is proportional to the diameter of the cell and is primarily due to light diffraction around the cell. FSC signal can be used for the discrimination of cells by size.

    "title": "Preparation of Hollow Polystyrene Particles and Microcapsules by Radical Polymerization of Janus Droplets Consisting of Hydrocarbon and Fluorocarbon Oils.",
    "abstract": "In this article, we have demonstrated a method for producing hollow particles and microcapsules using oil droplets consisting of hydrocarbon oil (styrene) and fluorocarbon oil (perfluoro-n-octane, PFO) in aqueous surfactant (sodium dodecylsulfate, SDS) solutions. Since fluorocarbon oils are immiscible with hydrocarbon oils, the two oils are separated. Emulsions are prepared by stirring styrene/PFO/aqueous SDS solution mixtures at 80 °C. The type of emulsions and the morphology of droplets in the emulsions are observed by light microscope and scanning confocal fluorescence microscope. It is found that oil droplets with Janus-type morphologies consisting of mutually immiscible styrene and PFO are formed in aqueous SDS solutions. Polystyrene particles are fabricated by radical polymerization of the ternary mixtures of styrene/PFO/aqueous SDS solution at 80 °C. The morphologies of the polystyrene are confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy observations. These observations show the preparation of hollow polystyrene particles with a single hole on the surface. To our knowledge, this method is a novel strategy using the immiscibility of hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils. The hollow particles can also be applied to the preparation of microcapsules.",
    "methods": "Protocol Caution: Please wear a lab-coat, gloves, and safety glasses and read material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. All purchased materials have been used without further purification. 1. Preparation of Emulsions Consisting of Styrene/PFO/Aqueous SDS Solution Mixtures To prepare 5 mM of aqueous SDS solution, dissolve 14.5 mg of SDS in 10 mL of high-purity H 2 O. NOTE: High-purity H 2 O has been used (resistivity ( R ) = 18 MΩ cm, surface tension ( γ ) = 72.0 mN m -1 at 25 °C). Add 1.5 g of styrene, 0.6 g of PFO, and 0.9 g of 5 mM of aqueous SDS solution to a 10 mL glass vial with a stir bar. NOTE: In scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy observations, add 2.6 mg of coumarin 102 and 0.062 mg of calcein to the mixture. Stir the mixture for 60 min at 1,150 rpm under room temperature and then raise the temperature to 80 °C. Stir the mixture for 60 min at 1,150 rpm and 80 °C. 2. Fabrication of polymer particles using Emulsions Consisting of Styrene/PFO/Aqueous SDS Solution Mixtures Add 3.9 mg of potassium peroxodisulfate, 2 mg of pyrene, 1.5 g of styrene, 0.6 g of PFO, and 0.9 g of 5 mM of aqueous SDS solution to a 10 mL glass vial with a stir bar and seal it with a rubber septum. Deoxygenate the mixture by bubbling nitrogen gas through a syringe needle for 30 min. Caution: Slowly flow the nitrogen gas to not generate a large amount of foam. To prepare the emulsion, stir the mixture for 60 min at 1,150 rpm and room temperature and then raise the temperature to 80 °C. Stir the mixture for 30 min at 1,150 rpm and 80 °C. Transfer the cloudy part (1.8 mL) in the resultant solution (3 mL) to the test tube and then add 30% aqueous ethanol solution to completely terminate the polymerization reaction. Sonicate (Power: 130 W, Frequency: 4.2 kHz) for 10 min to wash resultant polymer particles and then centrifuge for 10 min at 2300 x g. To obtain the polymer particles, remove the supernatant solution from the test tube. Add 3 mL of water to the resultant solids in the test tube. Sonicate (Power: 130 W, Frequency: 4.2 kHz) for 10 min and centrifuge for 10 min at 2300 x g. Remove the supernatant solution from the test tube. Repeat the washing procedure (Step 2.8) until foam is not generated from the supernatant solution. Evaporate water to obtain the solid of hollow polymer particles. 3. Preparation of microcapsules using the hollow polymer particles Add 1 mg of hollow polystyrene particles (step 2.9) and 4 mL of water to a 10 mL glass vial with a stir bar. Sonicate (Power: 130 W, Frequency: 4.2 kHz) for 10 min to disperse the hollow particles in water. Add 0.1 mL of toluene to the water dispersed the particles and then stir it for 1 h at 100 rpm under room temperature. Transfer the liquid to a test tube. Caution: If the rotation per minute increases, the morphology of particles will deform. Centrifuge the liquid for 10 min at 2300 x g to isolate the microcapsules form it. Remove the supernatant solution from the test tube.",

    "title": "Visualisation and quantification of intracellular interactions of Neisseria meningitidis and human α-actinin by confocal imaging.",
    "abstract": "The Opc protein of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm, meningococcus) is a surface-expressed integral outer membrane protein, which can act as an adhesin and an effective invasin for human epithelial and endothelial cells. We have identified endothelial surface-located integrins as major receptors for Opc, a process which requires Opc to first bind to integrin ligands such as vitronectin and via these to the cell-expressed receptors(1). This process leads to bacterial invasion of endothelial cells(2). More recently, we observed an interaction of Opc with a 100 kDa protein found in whole cell lysates of human cells(3). We initially observed this interaction when host cell proteins separated by electrophoresis and blotted on to nitrocellulose were overlaid with Opc-expressing Nm. The interaction was direct and did not involve intermediate molecules. By mass spectrometry, we established the identity of the protein as α-actinin. As no surface expressed α-actinin was found on any of the eight cell lines examined, and as Opc interactions with endothelial cells in the presence of serum lead to bacterial entry into the target cells, we examined the possibility of the two proteins interacting intracellularly. For this, cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were infected with Opc-expressing Nm for extended periods and the locations of internalised bacteria and α-actinin were examined by confocal microscopy. We observed time-dependent increase in colocalisation of Nm with the cytoskeletal protein, which was considerable after an eight hour period of bacterial internalisation. In addition, the use of quantitative imaging software enabled us to obtain a relative measure of the colocalisation of Nm with α-actinin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Here we present a protocol for visualisation and quantification of the colocalisation of the bacterium with intracellular proteins after bacterial entry into human endothelial cells, although the procedure is also applicable to human epithelial cells.",
    "methods": "Protocol 1. Immunofluorescence Protocol Seeding, Infection & immuno-staining The following procedures require suitable safety level tissue culture and microbiological laboratory facilities. DAY 1 A.Preparation of target cells for infection Seed HBMECs at 50% confluence (~1.5x10 4 cells/cm 2 ) on glass coverslips (16 mm diameter) placed into a 12-well plate (3.8 cm 2 growth area/well).Growth medium: RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30min) FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 1% (v/v) MEM non-essential amino acids solution and 1% MEM vitamins solution. Culture over night (O/N) at 37°C, in a 5% CO 2 incubator. B. Bacterial culture Grow the strain of interest O/N (16-18 h) on the required medium e.g. Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar plates supplemented with 10% heated horse blood at 37°C in 5% CO 2 atmosphere 4 . DAY 2 A. Preparation Of Bacterial ( N. meningitidis ) Suspension Using a 10 μL culture loop, make a suspension of the overnight bacterial culture in 2 mL PBSB (PBS with calcium and magnesium). Allow large bacterial aggregates to settle by leaving the suspension to stand for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Without disturbing the pellet, transfer the top 1 mL of the suspension (stock inoculum) into a sterile tube. To estimate bacterial numbers in the stock inoculum, add aliquots (20-50 μL) to tubes containing 1mL volumes of 1% SDS in 0.1M NaOH and mix gently to solubilise. Measure the nucleic acid content of the solution by determining the absorbance at 260nm (A260). In our hands, A260 of 1 corresponds to 5x10 8 colony forming units/ml (cfu/mL). This can be verified by preparing a series of dilutions of the stock inoculum in PBSB, plating out on agar plates and counting colonies after O/N incubation. Dilute an aliquot of the stock inoculum in the infection medium [(M199 supplemented with 2% decomplemented (56°C, 30min) normal human serum (NHS)] to obtain the required bacterial density for the infection of target cells. In our laboratory, an infection ratio of 200-300 bacteria per target cell is routinely used. B. Cell Culture Infection Wash the coverslips with cultured target cells 3 times with Hank's medium to remove any trace of antibiotics. Infect cells with freshly prepared bacterial suspensions (described above) for 3 h to 8 h at 37°C, in 5%CO 2 . At the end of infection period, wash cells three times with PBS and fix in 500 μL of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30-45 min at RT or O/N at 4°C. Paraformaldehyde fixation at the concentration and time shown above was found to be suitable for preservation of bacterial and cellular morphology. After washing off paraformaldehyde, permeabilise the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells by incubating in 0.1%Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 10 min. Wash the samples 3 times with PBS. Proceed to immuno-staining or, alternatively, leave samples in 500 μL of 1%BSA/PBST O/N at 4°C. DAY 3 Immuno-staining Staining of intracellular bacteria and α-actinin can be performed sequentially or simultaneously by the use of appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as follows; all procedures can be carried out in 12-well plates. Block the coverslips containing the permeabilised cells with 500 μL of 3% BSA/PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100) for 30-60 min at RT After washing with PBS, transfer each coverslip to a new dry well in the 12-well plate. Add the primary antibodies against bacteria and α-actinin; eighty to 100 μL of antibody per coverslip is sufficient if added carefully to cover the surface of the coverslip. Incubate for 1h at room temperature. We used rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Neisseria meningitidis (laboratory-raised) and mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against α-actinin (Abcam) simultaneously. In some experiments, in place of anti α-actinin, mAbs against actin or vimentin were used (Sigma). At the end of the incubation, add 200 μL of PBS to the well, lift the coverslip and place in a new well containing 500 μL PBS. After 5 min, remove PBS by pipetting and then add fresh PBS. Repeat twice. Transfer coverslips to a new dry well. Add the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to different fluorochromes diluted in 1% BSA/PBST; incubate at RT for 1h in the dark. For bacterial detection, we used anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to TRITC and for α-actinin and other cytoskeletal protein detection, we used anti-mouse Ig conjugated to either FITC- (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 488- (Invitrogen). At the end of the incubation, wash as in steps 4 and 5. Counter stain with 0.6 μg/mL DAPI in PBS (DNA stain) for 5 min at RT in the dark. Rinse with PBS. Mount coverslips (cells facing down) on slides with a drop of mounting medium (e,g. Mowiol or Vectashield) Store in the dark at 4°C. Samples are ready for observation under the microscope. 2. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) To observe and capture images of intracellular bacteria and cytoskeletal elements, we used immunolabelled samples and captured images using a Leica SP5-AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope attached to a Leica DM I6000 inverted epifluorescence microscope. All images were collected using a 63x NA 1.4 oil immersion objective and process with Leica software. CLSM procedure: To begin the CLSM procedure, add a drop of immersion oil to the objective and place the specimen slide, coverslip-side down, on the microscope stage. Set the microscope to a visual mode and find the area of interest using the eye pieces of the microscope. Using Leica Software, select the xyz acquisition mode. Select the 512 x 512 format (frame size). For colocalisation studies, the higher resolution, the more accurate the image; keeping in mind the resolution limit of the microscope. Then select the bidirectional X mode, which will increase the scanning speed and help reduce photo-bleaching. Set up sequential scanning settings. Click in the \"seq\" function and choose one of the scanning modes. We use \"between lines\" mode. Select laser beams according to the fluorochromes conjugated to the secondary antibodies: 405 nm for DAPI (blue), 488 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 (green) and 561 nm for TRITC (red). Activate Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Adjust PMT settings to detect the correct emission wavelength. Set up top (\"begin\") and bottom (\"end\") of z-stacks or series. Next, set the required \"z-step size\". Neisseria meningitidis is a diplococcus (Figure 1G) and since each coccus has an approximate diameter of 0.5 μm, the z-step size of 0.20 μm was chosen to enhance the probability of scanning each coccus at least twice. It is also within the step size for optimum resolution of 0.1 - 0.2 μm. Set the final scan parameters by selecting line averaging of 3 to improve the signal to noise ratio. By clicking \"start\" double- or triple-stained images are obtained by sequential scanning at different wavelengths to eliminate cross-talk between different chromophores. For an indication of colocalisation of two fluorochromes, select the \"overlay\" function to merge selected channels into a single image; for example, when both Alexa 488 (green) and TRITC (red) fluorochromes colocalise, yellow color will appear in the overlaid image. Compile z-stacks or series using the \"maximum projection\" function for the construction of a 2D image required for visualising possible colocalisation. More detailed analysis of colocalisation can be obtained by analysis of each optical section. After acquiring the z-stacks or series, process your data to obtain an orthogonal image for visualisation of intracellular localisation of various elements (Figure 1E). 3. Quantification of Colocalisation Statistical analyses of the confocal scanning microscope images are performed with Volocity software (Improvision, PerkinElmer). This software provides a tool designed specifically for colocalisation analysis as described by Manders et al. (1993) 5 . Colocalisation in the context of digital fluorescence imaging can be described as the detection of a signal at the same voxel (pixel volume) location in each channel. The two channels are made up of images of two different fluorochromes taken from the same sample area (Volocity user guide). Statistical analyses are performed with Volocity software (Improvision, PerkinElmer) using Quantitative Colocalisation Analysis described below. Quantitative Colocalisation Analysis Create a library with CLSM images using Volocity software. Select \"extended focus\" from image in the top bar. This tool will compile z-stacks in a 2D image to be analyzed. Select \"Colocalization\" tool. The two channels to be analyzed should have the same color depth. Select the area that it is going to be quantified. Set the threshold to remove any background. Create the colocalisation output by selecting \"generate colocalization\". Colocalisation statistics are generated for regions of interest selected previously. Select Manders' coefficients R (overlap coefficient) and My (colocalisation coefficient). Manders' coefficients are not sensitive to the intensity of staining as they are normalized against total pixel intensity; thus they can be employed when the staining of one antigen is stronger than the other. Overlap coefficient R according to Manders 5,6 represents the true degree of colocalisation, i.e. the number of pixels that colocalise compared with the total number of pixels. On the other hand, the colocalisation coefficient, My, describes the fluorescence contribution of the more abundant moiety (in this case α-actinin, green) to the less abundant moiety (in this case bacteria, red), i.e. the number of red pixels that overlap with green pixels compared with the total number of red pixels. Manders' coefficients range between 1 and 0, with 1 being high colocalisation, 0 being none; but they can be expressed as percentage for easier interpretation. Export statistics values to an Excel document for data presentation. 4. Representative Results Intracellular localisation of Opc-expressing Neisseria meningitidis and α-actinin Confocal imaging of human brain microvascular endothelial cells infected with Nm for 3 and 8 hours as described above indicated colocalisation of α-actinin and Nm which appeared to be less frequent in 3 h infection experiments (not shown) compared with cultures infected for 8 h (Figure 1 A-F). A demonstrable colocalisation of α-actinin with Opc-expressing meningococci was observed each time in >5 replicate experiments. Statistical analysis of colocalisation using several confocal images was carried out as described above. Overall, in HBMEC infected with Opc-expressing meningococci, >25% overlap of the green (α-actinin) and red (Nm) pixels was obtained (Figure 2B, Overlap coefficient R). In contrast to α-actinin, experiments in which labeling of internalised bacteria and either actin or vimentin was performed, occasional colocalisation was observed with actin but that with vimentin was rare (Figure. 2B). The data were also analyzed using the coefficient My, which takes into account the relative abundance of each moiety. My is a measure of the frequency of occurrence of the more abundant signal (in this case green, α-actinin) each time the less abundant signal (in this case red, bacteria) occurs. This measure shows a striking level of occurrence of α-actinin in the vicinity of internalised meningococci (Figure 2A and C). Figure 1. Confocal laser scanning microscopy to assess intracellular interactions of N. meningitidis with α-actinin. A-H. Confluent endothelial monolayers grown on coverslips were infected with the Opc-expressing (A-F) N. meningitidis . After 8 h, non-adherent bacteria were washed off, cells fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100. Subsequently, bacteria and α-actinin were stained as described above (α-actinin, green; bacteria, red). A-C. One field showing x-y images of the location of Nm (A) or α-actinin (B). The overlay image in (C) indicates several regions in which yellow-orange color appears suggesting colocalisation. Arrows in (A) and (B) show regions where a high degree of α-actinin accumulation appears to have occurred around bacteria. D. Optical dissection of an infected HBMEC monolayer indicating colocalisation around intracellular bacteria located at the base of a cell. Again, this colocalisation is not due to accidental proximity of α-actinin, as the general stain of α-actinin in this region is low. E and F. Three-dimensional images of infected HBMEC monolayers processed as above. An oblique view of the apical surface (E) shows adherent bacteria stained red (red arrow) whereas several bacteria located towards the basal surfaces of endothelial cells (yellow arrow) are distinctly orange/yellow in color. Basal location can be more clearly seen in (F) which is an end-on X-Z cross-section. G. A negatively stained electron microscope image of N. meningitidis showing its predominant diplococcal from. Each coccus is approximately 0.5 μm in diameter. Figure 2. Localisation and distribution of α-actinin, actin and vimentin in HBMEC cells. A. Infected monolayers of HBMEC were treated as described in the legend above but in addition to α-actinin, some coverslips were used for the detection of actin or vimentin by procedure similar to that for α-actinin. As above, α-actinin concentrated around several internalised bacteria (white arrows). Vimentin and actin did not colocalise with bacteria to appreciable levels. Bar represents 20 μm. B. & C. The values for the coefficients R and My were obtained from more than three experiments using Volocity software as described above.\n\n1.

    "title": "Simultaneous Non-Invasive Electrocardiogram and Respiration Rate Recordings in Head-Fixed Awake Mice.",
    "abstract": "Autonomic regulation of heart and respiratory rates is essential for understanding brain-body interactions in health and disease. Preclinical cardiovascular recordings are often performed under anesthesia or via telemetry, both of which introduce physiological confounds such as stress or impaired recovery due to the need for acute or chronic implantation of sensors. Here, we present a minimally invasive protocol for simultaneous acquisition of high-quality electrocardiography and respiratory signals in awake mice. Using an in-house-modified physiological monitor in awake, head-fixed mice that were briefly habituated to experimental conditions, we ultimately enable stable, long-term physiological recordings alongside in vivo microscopy. This protocol provides a robust, low-stress method for acquiring physiological signals, enabling the simultaneous study of cardiovascular-cerebral dynamics in awake head-fixed mice, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of preclinical measurements. Key features • Minimally invasive electrocardiogram and respiration rate acquisition in awake, head-fixed mice suitable for long-term physiological recordings. • Custom-built setup integrates physiological monitoring with in vivo imaging without surgical implantation or telemetry. • Rapid habituation protocol ensures low-stress conditions and high-quality signal acquisition in conscious mice. • Enables correlation of cardiovascular dynamics with brain activity and cerebrospinal fluid flow in translational neuroscience studies.",

Preparation of the physiological monitoring system: increasing the ECG electrode surface for measurements in awake and moving mice 1. Clean the monitoring platform a. Wipe all surfaces with distilled water and dry tissue paper. b. If necessary, use 70% ethanol, but avoid using isopropane as it may lead to plastic corrosion. Pause point: Allow to air dry completely for 15 min ( Figure 1A ). Figure 1. Step-by-step preparation and modification of the small animal physiological monitoring system for simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory recordings in awake, head-fixed mice. (A) Cleaning the surface of the Harvard Apparatus ECG monitoring platform with distilled water and drying with tissue paper. (B, C) Cutting and preparing four copper tape electrodes (4.5 × 2.5 cm) with even dimensions. (D) Applying a thin layer of Signagel electrode gel to ensure conductivity with platform and copper tape electrodes. (E) After copper tape electrode attachment. (F) Applying Tesaflex electrical insulation tape to isolate the copper tape edges and prevent accidental bridging. (G, H) Sealing exposed conductive surfaces with Dent Silicone-V to minimize electrical noise during recording. 2. Prepare copper electrode pads a. Cut copper tape (0.25 mm thickness, conductive adhesive) into four oval pads (approximately 4.5 × 2.5 cm) using scissors ( Figure 1B ). b. To ensure uniform change in electrical impedance of the new electrode fields, cut the pads to similar sizes ( Figure 1C ). However, bear in mind that the contribution of the additional copper layer to the overall electrode impedance would be negligible when considering that of the skin–electrode interface. c. Apply a thin, even layer of Signagel electrode gel (one drop, ~1 mm thick) to each copper pad ( Figure 1D ). 3. Attach copper pads to the ECG sensor surface a. Attach each copper to the existing electrode fields to extend their surface ( Figure 1E ). b. Maintain 2–3 mm distance between pads to prevent short circuits ( Figure 1E ). c. Remove any excess gel with clean tissue paper. 4. Isolate conductive surfaces a. Cover the edges of each copper pad using Tesaflex electrical tape ( Figure 1F ). b. Apply Dent Silicone-V over exposed conductive regions to prevent interference ( Figure 1G –H). 5. (Caution) Do not allow gel to contact insulation material, to prevent creating unintended conductive paths. Install absorbent pads. a. Cut KRUUSE dental pads into strips (0.5 cm wide) to fit over the copper pads. b. Fix strips in place using 3M Micropore surgical tape (1.25 cm width) to prevent movement. These strips absorb urine or excess gel during recording ( Figure 2A ). Note: Replace absorbent pads between animals. Figure 2. Final preparation of the physiological monitoring system before and after head-fixation of the mice for subsequent imaging, along with electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. (A) Cutting and placing narrow strips of KRUUSE dental pads (0.5 cm wide) over each electrode area to absorb urine and excess gel, secured with 3M surgical tape. (B) Constructing and placing a custom half-tube cardboard tunnel (approx. 7.5 cm × 2.5 cm) to provide restraint and comfort. 6. Prepare the restraint tunnel a. Cut a cylindrical cardboard tube (e.g., mailing tube or toilet roll) lengthwise to create a half-tube (approximately 7.5 cm × 2.5 cm, thickness 0.35 cm). b. Cut the top opening for head-fixation access ( Figure 2B ). c. (Optional) Cut a bottom opening for injection access during pharmacological studies. 7. Mount the tunnel a. Position the half-tube over the platform and secure it using surgical tape. b. Ensure stability so the animal remains comfortably supported ( Figure 2B ). Note: Ensure the mouse can move its forepaws freely under the tunnel without obstruction. B. Animal habituation to the setup Note: Animal models were adult, male, C57BL/6J mice, 8–12 weeks old, group-housed (5 per cage) under a 12-h light/dark cycle, 22 ± 1 °C, with ad libitum food and water. All procedures were approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate and University of Copenhagen, Denmark. B1. Begin 5-day habituation protocol 1. Day 1 a. Head-fix mouse in the MAG-1 stage for 5–10 min per session, 2 sessions separated by ≥1 h. The home cage is used for habituation to reduce stress. b. Return to the home cage and reward with a sunflower seed or a treat of your choice. 2. Day 2 a. First session: Gently head-fix the mice in the MAG-1 stage and place them in the home cage for 30 min. b. Return the mice to the home cage for 1 h before the second session. c. Second session: Gently head-fix the mice in the MAG-1 stage and place them in the home cage for 90 min. d. Return the mice to the home cage and reward with sunflower seeds or a treat of your choice. Day 3 a. Single session: Gently head-fix the mice in the MAG-1 stage and place them in the home cage for 90 min. b. Return the mice to the home cage and reward with sunflower seeds or a treat of your choice. Day 4 a. Single session: Gently head-fix the mice in the MAG-1 stage and place them in the home cage for 180 min. b. Return the mice to the home cage and reward with sunflower seeds or a treat of your choice. Day 5 a. Single session: Gently head-fix the mice in the MAG-1 stage and place them in the home cage for 180 min. b. Return the mice to the home cage and reward with sunflower seeds or a treat of your choice. Day 6 a. Ready for full recording. Gently head-fix the mice in the MAG-1 as shown in Figure 2 for imaging. Note: If mice display stress or excessive motion, extend habituation by 1–2 days. B2. Ensure safety and stress monitoring 1. Observe for signs of distress (e.g., escape behavior, vocalization, urination). 2. ( Caution) Do not proceed to recording until stress levels are minimal. C. Preparation for the recording 1. Secure the mouse in the MAG-1 stage a. Gently head-fix the mouse to the physiological monitor using the headplate. b. Adjust height and alignment to ensure stability without excessive pressure. c. Confirm if the body fits under the tunnel comfortably. 2. Apply electrode gel a. Place the mouse’s forepaws directly on the copper pads. b. Apply ~0.05 mL of Signagel under each paw using a pipette tip. c. Confirm stable, direct contact. 3. Cover the body: Place the cardboard tunnel over the mouse’s torso and tape it securely to the platform. Note: This improves restraint and reduces motion artifacts. 4. Insulate the mouse: Gently place a 5 × 5 cm sterile gauze pad over the back to provide warmth and reduce evaporative heat loss. 5. Add electrical grounding: Connect the monitor’s ground wire to a known earth-grounded source (e.g., grounded outlet, metal lab bench). Caution : Improper grounding may introduce 50/60 Hz electrical noise. 6. Allow acclimation a. Leave the animal in position for 10 min before starting recordings. b. Observe signals in Clampex to assess baseline quality. D. Recordings 1. Start the Clampex software. Use Clampex v10.7.0.3 for live signal monitoring and acquisition. 2. Check signal quality a. Confirm visibility of clear ECG peaks and respiration waveforms. b. Adjust gel or paw position if signal-to-noise ratio is low. 3. Record data a. Acquire continuous data for 30–180 min, depending on experimental needs. b. Observe the animal throughout for signs of discomfort. c. (Optional) Note behavioral events or interventions during recording. 4. End the session a. Turn off recording and gently release the headplate. b. Return the animal to its original home cage, with fresh bedding. 5. Clean the setup a. Remove used pads and tape. b. Wipe surfaces with distilled water or 70% ethanol. c. Dispose of waste following institutional biosafety guidelines. d. Ensure full drying before next session.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol has been applied in numerous awake, head-fixed mice across multiple experimental series, demonstrating high reproducibility and robust physiological signal quality. The setup supports stable long-term recordings of ECG and respiration signals, with durations of up to 3 h following the described habituation protocol. Although motion-related artifacts may occur, they can be reliably identified and removed during data analysis using peak detection and filtering algorithms. To illustrate signal stability and physiological relevance, summary data from seven representative mice are presented in Table 1 , including sex, duration, and heart and respiration rate. While the full dataset is not yet published, it underpins ongoing investigations of neurocardiovascular coupling in migraine and sleep regulation models. Representative traces and analysis workflows are included in this manuscript (see Figure 3A – C ). Table 1.

    "title": "Flow-based In Vivo Method to Enumerate Translating Ribosomes and Translation Elongation Rate.",
    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is by far the most energetically costly cellular process in rapidly dividing cells. Quantifying translating ribosomes in individual cells and their average mRNA transit rate is arduous. Quantitating assembled ribosomes in individual cells requires electron microscopy and does not indicate ribosome translation status. Measurement of average transit rates entails in vitro pulse-chase radiolabeling of isolated cells or ribosome profiling after ribosome runoff, which is expensive and extremely demanding technically. Here, we detail protocols based on ribosome-mediated nascent chain puromycylation, harringtonine to stall initiating ribosomes while allowing ribosome elongation to continue normally, and cycloheximide to freeze translating ribosomes in place. Each compound is delivered intravenously to mice in the appropriate order, and after ex vivo cell fixation and permeabilization, translating ribosome numbers and transit rates are measured by flow cytometry using a directly conjugated puromycin-specific antibody. Key features • Measure relative numbers of translating ribosomes in mixed single-cell preparations. • Quantitate relative in vivo ribosome transit rates in mixed single-cell preparations. • Detect ribosome stalling in vivo.",

Intravenous injections of reagents necessary for in vivo RiboPuroMycylation (RPM ) Note 1: All in vivo procedures require approval by your institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC). Note 2: The in vivo RPM procedure has been successfully performed on lymph nodes, spleens, and thymi from mice, although a similar procedure has been performed in vitro on other organs such as fetal liver [10]. Note 3: For in vivo RPM and RTA procedures, we have used female and male mice aged 1.5–18 months. Mice were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to normal mouse chow and water. The procedure was developed using C57BL/6J (B6) mice, and we have performed it using other mice on the B6 and FVB/N background. We expect this protocol will work similarly in other mouse strains and animal models, with adjustments to drug dosage. For the in vivo RPM assay, prepare a solution of 10 mg/mL PMY, 1 mg/mL HAR, and 3.4 mg/mL CHX in PBS and warm in a water bath to 37 °C to allow PMY to completely solubilize (see Recipes). Prepare approximately 20% extra of this solution, as fluid loss during injections will occur. Prepare a solution of 1 mg/mL of HAR in PBS (see Recipes). Prepare approximately 20% extra of this solution, as fluid loss during injections will occur. Warm mice for 5–10 min using an ACUC-approved heat lamp to dilate tail veins. Mice are considered sufficiently warm for injections when their activity within the cage is increased. Restrain warmed mice in a mouse holder and intravenously inject the tail vein, using a 27G × ½ needle attached to a 1 mL syringe, with 100 μL of the HAR/CHX/PMY solution, waiting 5 min for the maximum signal. To determine the background RPM signal not related to active protein synthesis, inject mice with 100 μL of the HAR solution, wait 15 min for ribosomes to finish translating mRNAs, and then inject 100 μL of the HAR/CHX/PMY solution and wait 5 min. A third control is necessary, injecting vehicle without PMY to control for non-specific staining of the anti-PMY mAb. After the indicated times, sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation and harvest organs of interest into 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes containing 3 mL of RPMI supplemented with 7.5% FBS on ice. Figure 1. Depiction of the in vivo RiboPuroMycylation (RPM)-ribosome transit assay (RTA). In this example, CFSE-labeled OT-1 T cells (CFSE tracks cell division) are adoptively transferred into congenic mice (to allow tracking of donor cells in recipient mice), followed by infection with vaccinia virus expressing the SIINFEKL peptide (Kb-SIINFEKL activates OT-1 T cells). RPM-RTA is performed by intravenous injection of harringtonine (HAR) for different amounts of time followed by HAR, cycloheximide (to prevent leakiness from HAR inhibition alone), and puromycin. Spleens are harvested for RPM analysis on both endogenous and transferred T cells. Schematic designed with BioRender. B. Intravenous injections of reagents necessary for in vivo RPM ribosome transit analysis (RTA) Note: The timing of intravenous injections is critical. It is strongly suggested that this procedure be done by a two-person team: one person using a timer to record the time of injections and the other to perform the injections. For in vivo RPM RTA (depiction of an experimental setup in Figure 1 ), prepare a solution of 10 mg/mL PMY, 1 mg/mL HAR, and 3.4 mg/mL CHX and warm in a water bath to 37 °C to allow PMY to completely solubilize (see Recipes). Prepare approximately 20% extra of this solution, as fluid loss during injections will occur. Prepare a solution of 1 mg/mL HAR (see Recipes). Prepare approximately 20% extra of this solution, as fluid loss during injections will occur. Warm mice for 5–10 min using an ACUC-approved heat lamp to dilate tail veins. Mice are considered sufficiently warm for injections when their activity within the cage is increased. Restrain warmed mice in a mouse holder, intravenously inject the tail vein using a 27G × ½ needle attached to a 1 mL syringe with 100 μL of the HAR/CHX/PMY solution, and wait 5 min for maximum signal. To determine ribosome transit times, inject 100 μL of HAR and wait for 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, or 10 min before injecting with 100 μL of the HAR/CHX/PMY solution. As above, a no-PMY control is needed. After the indicated times, sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation and harvest organs of interest into 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes containing 3 mL of RPMI supplemented with 7.5% FBS on ice. C. Preparation of single-cell samples for flow cytometry Note 1: All steps below are performed at 4 °C with ice-cold solutions. Note 2: We have stained anywhere from 1 to 6 million cells per well in a 96-well plate, with adjustments to antibody concentrations for surface and intracellular antigens. Crush organs (we have used spleens, thymi, or lymph nodes) in 3 mL of RPMI between two frosted microscope slides in a 60 mm × 15 mm standard cell culture dish. Filter resultant single-cell suspensions through a 70 μm mesh screen back into a standard polyethylene 15 mL centrifuge tube. Lyse red blood cells present in tissue samples by adding 6 mL of ACK lysing buffer directly to the single cell suspensions and mix by quickly rotating the tubes. Centrifuge filtered single-cell suspensions at 350× g for 4 min at 4 °C and pour off supernatants. Disrupt cell pellets by tapping the bottom of the 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes quickly 3–4 times. Resuspend cells in 3 mL of cold RPMI supplemented with 7.5% FBS. Centrifuge at 350× g for 4 min at 4 °C, pour off supernatants, disrupt cell pellet, and add 3 mL of cold RPMI supplemented with 7.5% FBS. Refilter cell suspensions again through a 70 μm mesh screen. Count resuspended cells with a Nexcelom Cellometer Vision using Trypan Blue (1:1 dilution) for live/dead cell discrimination as per the manufacturer’s instructions. After counting, centrifuge the cell suspensions in 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes at 350× g for 4 min at 4 °C, pour off supernatants, disrupt cell pellets, and resuspend cells in cold RPMI supplemented with 7.5% FBS at 10 million cells per milliliter. Add 200 μL (1–6 million cells per well can be plated; here, 2 million cells per well are plated) of the cell suspensions from each sample to a well of a 96-well polystyrene U-bottom plate. D. Surface and intracellular stains for flow cytometry analysis Note 1: Stains for flow cytometry are all performed on ice. Note 2: Anti-puromycin Ab should be conjugated with the required fluorochrome ahead of time with a Life Technologies Protein Labeling kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Note 3: The fluorescence signal from the fluorochrome-conjugated anti-puromycin Ab will dim over time. It is recommended that you only use the conjugated anti-PMY Ab for six months. For single-color controls (SCC) and fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls, prepare a mixture of equal numbers of cells from each sample for each organ type isolated (all splenocytes in one mixture, all cells from thymi in a separate mixture). This mixture is made for appropriate flow cytometer setup and downstream analysis. New SCCs and FMOs should be prepared for each experiment. Settings on the flow cytometer may be reused, depending on the experience of the experimenter. Mix Abs at proper dilutions in FACS buffer for SCCs, FMOs, and the full Ab mix to allow for 100 μL per sample in the 96-well plate. Centrifuge cells in the 96-well plate at 350× g for 4 min at 4 °C. Before dumping the supernatant [with one (!) quick smooth wrist flick into a biohazard bucket], check that solid cell pellets have formed at the bottom of the 96-well plate. Resuspend cells in 200 μL of PBS using a 12-well multichannel pipette. Centrifuge the plate as above. Dump the supernatant and resuspend the appropriate FMOs, SCCs, and samples in 100 μL of a 10 μg/mL solution of EMA in PBS for flow-based live/dead cell discrimination (see Recipes). Place the plate in the dark on ice for 10 min. Next, expose the uncovered plate close to a fluorescent light with the lid off for an additional 10 min on ice. While exposure to a commercial fluorescent light is suitable for crosslinking EMA to DNA, a wavelength of 465–475 nm has been described to work in the PMA-Lite TM 2.0 LED Photolysis Device (Biotium, catalog number: E90006 ). Add 100 μL of PBS to each well, pipette up and down to mix, and centrifuge as above. After washing with 200 μL of PBS twice, perform surface staining. Resuspend cells in 100 μL of FACS buffer with the 2.42G monoclonal antibody (Ab) to block Fc receptors (dilution as per manufacturer’s instructions) on ice for 10 min. Add 100 μL of the appropriate single Abs for SCCs, Ab mixes for FMOs, or full Ab mix for full stains, to cell surface antigens at appropriate dilutions for 30 min at 4 °C (a common Ab panel we use and the associated dilutions are listed in Table 1 ). Centrifuge as above and wash twice in 200 μL of PBS. Table 1.

Add 100 μL of PBS, centrifuge as above, and wash twice with PBS. Stain for PMY after the fix/perm step using a 1:100 dilution of the conjugated anti-PMY Ab for 1 h (it could be overnight if more convenient). Add 100 μL of PBS, pipette up and down 6–8 times, and centrifuge the plate as above. Wash twice with 200 μL of PBS, resuspend cell pellets in FACS buffer, and analyze samples (samples should remain on ice during the run) with a flow cytometer. Samples may be stored in a dark refrigerator for up to a week prior to running on a flow cytometer. We use a BD LSRII or BD LSR Fortessa X-20 to run samples, but any flow cytometer with the appropriate lasers and filter sets may be used.\n\nValidation of protocol This protocol or parts of it has been used and validated in the following research article: Seedhom et al.

    "title": "Quantitative Measurement of Plasma Membrane Protein Internalisation and Recycling in Heterogenous Cellular Samples by Flow Cytometry.",
    "abstract": "Plasma membrane proteins mediate important aspects of physiology, including nutrient acquisition, cell-cell interactions, and monitoring homeostasis. The trafficking of these proteins, involving internalisation from and/or recycling back to the cell surface, is often critical to their functions. These processes can vary among different proteins and cell types and states and are still being elucidated. Current strategies to measure surface protein internalisation and recycling are typically microscopy or biochemical assays; these are accurate but generally limited to analysing a homogenous cell population and are often low throughput. Here, we present flow cytometry-based methods involving probe-conjugated antibodies that enable quantification of internalisation or recycling rates at the single-cell level in complex samples. To measure internalisation, we detail an assay where the protein of interest is labelled with a specific antibody conjugated to a fluorescent oligonucleotide-labelled probe. To measure recycling, a specific antibody conjugated to a cleavable biotin group is employed. These probes permit the differentiation of molecules that have been internalised or recycled from those that have not. When combined with cell-specific marker panels, these methods allow the quantitative study of plasma membrane protein trafficking dynamics in a heterogenous cell mixture at the single-cell level. Key features • These assays allow sensitive quantification of internalised or recycled surface molecules using oligonucleotide or cleavable biotin-conjugated probes, respectively, and detected by flow cytometry. • They can be adapted to any membrane protein that transits via the cell surface and for which a specific purified antibody is available. • The dynamics of a cell surface protein can be measured in heterogenous cell populations simultaneously, including various cellular activation states. • The internalisation assay builds upon the method developed by Liu et al. [1,2] and extends its application to heterogenous human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. • These assays have been extensively used on suspension cells but have not been tested on adherent cells.",

Dilute 200 μg of antibody to 2 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). Add 7 μL of Click-iT TM sDIBO Alkyne and incubate for 2 h at 4 °C. Remove the bottom closure of 7K Zeba spin desalting column and place it in a 1.5 mL tube. Centrifuge the column at 1500× g for 1 min and discard the storage solution. Add 300 μL of PBS to the column and centrifuge at 1500× g for 1 min. Discard flowthrough. Repeat twice. Place the column in a 1.5 mL low-protein binding tube and add the protein-DIBO solution. Centrifuge at 1500× g for 2 min and collect the eluate (containing the DIBO-labelled antibody eluate). Add 20 μL of Cy5-oligo-azide to the eluate and incubate for at least 2 h (or ideally overnight) at 4 °C. This allows the reaction of conjugating the Cy5-oligo-azide to the DIBO-antibody forming the FIP. Equilibrate the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter by adding 500 μL of PBS and centrifuging at 13,000× g for 1 min. Discard flowthrough and any remaining PBS in the filter. Top up the FIP solution (from step A8) to 500 μL in total with PBS. Add to the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter and centrifuge at 13,000× g for 5 min to remove excess unconjugated reagents. Discard flowthrough. Repeat step A11 by rinsing the filter with 500 µL of PBS until the flowthrough is clear (approximately three washes). Recover the purified FIP by placing the filter upside down in a new 2 mL tube and centrifuge at 1,000× g for 2 min. Store the FIP in the dark at 4 °C for short-term use (<2 weeks) or aliquot and store at -20 °C for long-term storage. FIP should be titrated to find the optimal staining dilution prior to beginning the assay as for normal flow cytometry antibodies (See Troubleshooting 2). Recycling probe Overview: Recycling probe is prepared by biotinylating antibody with EZ-Link TM Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin that reacts with the primary amines on the antibody. Dilute 200 μg of antibody to 2 mg/mL in PBS. Prepare a 10 mM solution of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Add 2.7 μL of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin to the antibody (step B1). Incubate the reaction on ice for 2 h to allow the conjugation of the Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin to the antibody. Remove the bottom closure of 7K Zeba spin desalting column and place it in a 1.5 mL tube. Centrifuge the column at 1,500× g for 1 min and discard the storage solution. Add 300 μL of PBS, centrifuge at 1,500× g for 1 min, and discard flowthrough. Repeat twice. Place column in a 1.5 mL low-protein binding tube and add the protein/Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin solution. Centrifuge at 1,500× g for 2 min and collect the antibody-SS-Biotin (the recycling probe) in the eluate. Store the recycling probe in the dark at 4 °C for short-term use (<2 weeks) or aliquot and store at -20 °C for long-term storage. Recycling probe should be titrated to find the optimal staining dilution prior to beginning the assay as for normal flow cytometry antibodies (See Troubleshooting 2). Internalisation assay Surface protein labelling Prechill the centrifuge, plates, tubes, and solutions at 4 °C. Add cells in 2 million cells per millilitre of suspension in cell culture media to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 620× g for 2 min. Wash cells once with staining buffer after removing supernatant. Stain the cells with FIP diluted in staining buffer on ice for 20 min. Wash the cells twice with ice-cold staining buffer. Resuspend the cells in prechilled cell culture media at 2 million cells per millilitre. Internalisation at 37 °C Transfer 100 µL of the cell suspension (200,000 cells) into the appropriate wells of 96-round-bottom plates, on ice. Use two plates and perform each sample/time point in triplicate: Plate 1 ( control plate , always on ice) requires two control samples: T int = 0 –Q: Cells are not allowed to internalise and are not treated with quencher (Q). T int = 0 +Q: Background control —cells are not allowed to internalise and are treated with Q. Plate 2 ( internalisation plate , always in incubator at 37 °C). T int =X +Q: Internalisation sample where cells are allowed to internalise for X time. Repeat for each time point. Keep Plate 1 on ice. Incubate Plate 2 at 37 °C for the desired duration for internalisation to occur. Transfer T int =X +Q samples from Plate 2 to Plate 1 (on ice) at the end of each time point, terminating internalisation for that sample. Quenching the un-internalised labelled protein and cell phenotyping surface marker staining At this point, only Plate 1 remains. Wash the cells by adding 150 μL of ice-cold staining buffer to each well. Centrifuge the plate at 300× g for 5 min. Decant the supernatant. Repeat the wash. Resuspend the cells in cell surface marker staining solution with or without Q (dilution 1/1,000) as indicated and incubate on ice for 15 min. Wash twice with ice-cold staining buffer. Measuring the percentage of internalised protein of interest Run the cells on a flow cytometer. Measure the geometric mean fluorescent intensity (gMFI) of the Cy5 (FIP) for each cell population using FlowJo (refer to Figure 2 for typical results). Calculate internalisation (see Data Analysis 1). Figure 2. Results from the internalisation or recycling assays for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I related protein 1 (MR1) using human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs). (A) T cells and monocytes can be differentiated based on markers CD3 and CD14. The percentage of each population is shown in the plot. After identifying the cell population, (B) the fluorescence internalisation probe Cy5 signal (FIP-Cy5, using the antibody clone 8F2.F9 specific for MR1) for the internalisation assay or (C) the recycling probe–labelled Streptavidin-PE (using antibody clone 8F2.F9) for the recycling can be measured by flow cytometry. With the corresponding controls [T int = 0 with and without quencher (Q) or MESNa cleavage (M)], the percentage of internalised or recycled molecules can be calculated. T INT indicates internalisation time. T REC indicates recycling time. Fluorescence minus one (FMO) indicates where the cells were stained with cell phenotyping antibodies and secondary staining but not FIP-Cy5 (B) or recycling probe (C). FMO served as the background control for the spread of signal in the multicolour panel and to know the quenching or cleaving effect in internalisation and recycling assays, respectively. Shown here for each assay, the typical results of one experiment (representing > 10) are shown by the geometric mean fluorescence (gMFI) and the calculated proportion of molecules that have been internalised (B) or recycled (C). Recycling assay Surface protein labelling Prechill the centrifuge, plates, tubes, and solutions at 4 °C. Add cells in 2 million cells per millilitre of suspension in cell culture media to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 620× g for 2 min. Wash cells once with staining buffer after removing the supernatant. Stain the cells with staining buffer with the recycling probe on ice for 20 min. Wash the cells twice with ice-cold staining buffer. Resuspend the cells in prechilled cell culture media at 2 million cells per millilitre. Internalisation at 37 °C Transfer 100 µL of the cell suspension (200,000 cells) into the appropriate wells of 96-round-bottom plates, on ice. Use two plates and perform each sample/time point in triplicate: Plate 1 ( control plate , always on ice) requires one control sample: –INT –M: Cells are not allowed to internalise (INT) and are not treated with MESNa (M). Plate 2 ( internalisation/recycling plate , always in incubator at 37 °C except for Step C). +INT +M T rec = 0: Background control —Cells are allowed to internalise, treated with M, but not allowed to recycle. +INT +M T rec = X: Cells are allowed to internalise, treated with M, and then allowed to recycle for time X. Repeat for each time point. Keep Plate 1 on ice. Incubate Plate 2 at 37 °C for the desired duration for internalisation to occur (typically 20–120 min). The optimal time for internalisation is the time required for a significant amount to be internalised—typically ~50%–100%; for MR1, this is 1 h ( Figure 2B ). This should be empirically tested for each molecule and cell type. Cleaving biotin from the un-internalised labelled protein Note: This step is conducted on all +M samples in plate 1 and 2 on ice. Wash the +M samples once by pelleting down the cells by centrifuging at 300× g for 5 min and adding 200 µL of ice-cold recycling assay buffer 1 to the cell pellet in each well. Centrifuge again and decant the supernatant. Resuspend the +M samples in 40 µL of ice-cold MESNA incubation buffer. Incubate for 10 min on ice. Wash the +M samples once with ice-cold recycling assay buffer 2. Repeat steps C2–C4 once. Wash once with culture media. Resuspend cells in culture media. Transfer +INT +M T rec = 0 samples from Plate 2 to Plate 1 (on ice) at the end of the internalisation and keep on ice. Recycling at 37 °C Note: At this point, only T rec = X samples remain in Plate 2. Incubate samples remaining in Plate 2 at 37 °C for time X, to allow recycling of the protein to occur. At the end of each incubation, transfer the samples to Plate 1 on ice. Staining of the recycled labelled protein and cell phenotyping surface marker staining Wash all the samples twice with ice-cold staining buffer. Resuspend the cells in cell phenotyping staining solution including Streptavidin-PE (1:200) and incubate on ice for 15 min. Wash twice with ice-cold staining buffer. Measuring the percentage of internalised protein of interest Run the cells on flow cytometer. Measure the gMFI of PE of each cell population using FlowJo (refer to Figure 2 for typical results).

    "title": "Nanoscale spatiotemporal cluster analysis of expressed and endogenous proteins.",
    "abstract": "Super-resolution microscopy has revolutionized the ability to investigate biological structures and processes, which are now accessible at nanoscale resolution. Recent advances in single-particle tracking (SPT) approaches have enabled researchers to study the intermolecular dynamics of individual proteins within their native environments in live cells. Fluorescent intrabody localization microscopy expands on existing SPT approaches such as SPT photoactivated localization microscopy by granting access to the nanoclustering dynamics of intracellular endogenous proteins through the use of single-domain nanobodies that can also differentiate between the conformational states of proteins. Here we detail how to perform single-molecule imaging of expressed proteins and nanobodies raised against endogenous proteins. We provide a streamlined analytical pipeline utilizing newly established clustering algorithms for extracting meaningful biological information. Nanoclustering analysis using spatiotemporal indexing is an open-source program with a user interface that enables the extraction of a range of dynamic nanoclustering metrics, including spatial and temporal information, from SPT data. This Protocol combines these single-molecule tracking and spatiotemporal clustering approaches into a comprehensive guide for researchers to achieve the precise localization of expressed and endogenous proteins and the characterization of their conformation-specific clustering behavior within subcellular compartments at nanoscale resolution. The procedure requires 2-4 d and is suitable for users with some prior experience in super-resolution microscopy and microscopy data analysis.",

    "title": "An Alternative Technique for Monitoring the Live Interaction of Monocytes and Tumor Cells with Nanoparticles in the Mouse Lung.",
    "abstract": "Nanomaterials are increasingly used for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, including lung cancer. For the clinical translation of nano-based theranostics, it is vital to detect and monitor their accumulation in the tumor, as well as their interaction with tumor, immune cells, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). While high resolution microscopy of fixed tumor specimens can provide some of this information from individual thin slices, it cannot capture cellular events over time and lacks 3D information of the tumor tissue. On the other hand, in vivo optical procedures either fall short of providing the necessary cellular resolution, as in the case of epifluorescence optical imaging, or are very demanding, as for instance intravital lung microscopy. We describe an alternative approach to investigate nanoparticle-cell interactions in entire mouse lung lobes, by longitudinal live cell confocal microscopy at nanometer resolution. By filling the lung ex vivo with 1% agarose, we were able to stabilize the lung lobes and visualize the interaction of fluorescent cells and nanoparticles for at least 4 hours post mortem. This high resolution ex vivo live cell imaging approach is an easy 4D tool for assessing several dynamic processes in tumor tissue, such as the traffic of cells, shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissue.

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional (4D) light imaging has been used to study behavior of small structures within motor nerve terminals of the thin transversus abdominis muscle of the garter snake. Raw data comprises time-lapse sequences of 3D z-stacks. Each stack contains 4-20 images acquired with epifluorescence optics at focal planes separated by 400-1,500 nm. Steps in the acquisition of image stacks, such as adjustment of focus, switching of excitation wavelengths, and operation of the digital camera, are automated as much as possible to maximize image rate and minimize tissue damage from light exposure. After acquisition, a set of image stacks is deconvolved to improve spatial resolution, converted to the desired 3D format, and used to create a 4D \"movie\" that is suitable for variety of computer-based analyses, depending upon the experimental data sought. One application is study of the dynamic behavior of two classes of endosomes found in nerve terminals-macroendosomes (MEs) and acidic endosomes (AEs)-whose sizes (200-800 nm for both types) are at or near the diffraction limit. Access to 3D information at each time point provides several advantages over conventional time-lapse imaging. In particular, size and velocity of movement of structures can be quantified over time without loss of sharp focus. Examples of data from 4D imaging reveal that MEs approach the plasma membrane and disappear, suggesting that they are exocytosed rather than simply moving vertically away from a single plane of focus. Also revealed is putative fusion of MEs and AEs, by visualization of overlap between the two dye-containing structures as viewed in each three orthogonal projections.",

    "title": "A simple protocol for platelet-mediated clumping of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in a resource poor setting.",
    "abstract": "P. falciparum causes the majority of severe malarial infections. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cerebral malaria (CM) are not fully understood and several hypotheses have been put forward, including mechanical obstruction of microvessels by P. falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (pRBC). Indeed, during the intra-erythrocytic stage of its life cycle, P. falciparum has the unique ability to modify the surface of the infected erythrocyte by exporting surface antigens with varying adhesive properties onto the RBC membrane. This allows the sequestration of pRBC in multiple tissues and organs by adhesion to endothelial cells lining the microvasculature of post-capillary venules (1). By doing so, the mature forms of the parasite avoid splenic clearance of the deformed infected erythrocytes (2) and restrict their environment to a more favorable low oxygen pressure (3). As a consequence of this sequestration, it is only immature asexual parasites and gametocytes that can be detected in peripheral blood. Cytoadherence and sequestration of mature pRBC to the numerous host receptors expressed on microvascular beds occurs in severe and uncomplicated disease. However, several lines of evidence suggest that only specific adhesive phenotypes are likely to be associated with severe pathological outcomes of malaria. One example of such specific host-parasite interactions has been demonstrated in vitro, where the ability of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 to support binding of pRBC with particular adhesive properties has been linked to development of cerebral malaria (4,5). The placenta has also been recognized as a site of preferential pRBC accumulation in malaria-infected pregnant women, with chondrotin sulphate A expressed on syncytiotrophoblasts that line the placental intervillous space as the main receptor (6). Rosetting of pRBC to uninfected erythrocytes via the complement receptor 1 (CD35)(7,8) has also been associated with severe disease (9). One of the most recently described P. falciparum cytoadherence phenotypes is the ability of the pRBC to form platelet-mediated clumps in vitro. The formation of such pRBC clumps requires CD36, a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of platelets. Another human receptor, gC1qR/HABP1/p32, expressed on diverse cell types including endothelial cells and platelets, has also been shown to facilitate pRBC adhesion on platelets to form clumps (10). Whether clumping occurs in vivo remains unclear, but it may account for the significant accumulation of platelets described in brain microvasculature of Malawian children who died from CM (11). In addition, the ability of clinical isolate cultures to clump in vitro was directly linked to the severity of disease in Malawian (12) and Mozambican patients (13), (although not in Malian (14)). With several aspects of the pRBC clumping phenotype poorly characterized, current studies on this subject have not followed a standardized procedure. This is an important issue because of the known high variability inherent in the assay (15). Here, we present a method for in vitro platelet-mediated clumping of P. falciparum with hopes that it will provide a platform for a consistent method for other groups and raise awareness of the limitations in investigating this phenotype in future studies. Being based in Malawi, we provide a protocol specifically designed for a limited resource setting, with the advantage that freshly collected clinical isolates can be examined for phenotype without need for cryopreservation.",
    "methods": "Protocol 1. Sample Collection Platelets can be easily activated through temperature, agitation or storage and therefore they should be handled with care. The use of vacutainers to collect blood for platelet preparation is unavoidable in most clinical situations, but should be carefully considered as suction can potentially cause platelet activation. Due to the clinical protocol used at our research hospital, our samples are carefully collected in sodium citrate vacutainers. We have not experienced any problems with premature platelet activation in this or our previous study 12 . We collect blood for platelet preparation from blood group O+ individuals to minimize nonspecific blood group antigen aggregation. Donors have also not taken medication in the previous 7-10 days as some drugs are known to influence platelet function. 1.1 Preparation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) Collect approximately 5 ml of whole blood from a malaria naive host or 2.5 ml of blood from CM or severe malaria (SM) patients in a sodium citrate vacutainer (BD product number 36276). Centrifuge the whole blood at 250 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Do not centrifuge at 4 °C as low temperatures may cause the platelets to aggregate. Carefully transfer the cloudy supernatant in a clean 15 ml tube . Platelets are easily activated by temperature variations and physical shocks and should therefore be handled with care. Avoid shaking or any jerky movements of the tube. Use a Neubauer's haematocytometer to count and adjust the platelet suspension to >300 x 10 3 platelets/μl for healthy donors and <150 x 10 3 platelets/μl from CM and SM patients using 1X phosphate buffer (pH 7.2-7.4; PBS). Make sure to choose a high dilution factor to ease the platelet count and ensure its accuracy. Note: Malaria patients have a reduced platelet count compared to the healthy individuals 16,17,18 . Therefore platelet concentrations for CM and UM are adjusted according to the average platelet counts for patients within each malaria diagnostic group. The P. falciparum clumping phenotype is common in CM isolates and displays a strong binding affinity therefore the reduced platelet concentrations does not affect clump size or frequency since platelet concentration is standardized for all CM cases. 1.2 Preparation of platelet-poor plasma (PPP) To obtain PPP, centrifuge a portion of the PRP obtained above at 1,500 x g for 10 min. The majority of platelets are pelleted at the bottom of the tube. Both PRP and PPP can be stored at 4 °C for up to two weeks. Ideally, use fresh platelets for the clumping assay. After 8-10 days most of the platelets are likely to be inactive and probably aggregated. 2. Parasite Culture Wash the pelleted pRBC three times with 5-10 ml RPMI 1640 by centrifugation at 370 x g for 5 min. Note: in this protocol all cultures started from approximately 1 ml packed cell volume (PCV) and maintained at 5% haematocrit. Cultures can be started with any PCV of pRBC and adjusted accordingly with uninfected RBC and media to reach desired haematocrit. Place the pRBC in a culture flask and supplement with standard malaria culture medium of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 5% Albumax II or 10% serum and 40 μg/ml gentamycin to achieve a 5% haematocrit. Permeate culture flasks with a mixture of 92.5% nitrogen, 2.5% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide before sealing and incubating. Alternatively, the air-tight candle jar method of Trager-Jensen can be used. For pRBC obtained directly from patients, incubate their culture flask for 24-36 hr in a 37 °C incubator in 5% CO 2 to get mature parasites. NOTE: Most laboratory and culture-adapted lines are very easy to maintain in culture under standard conditions. There are simple techniques described below that can be used to synchronise different parasite stages to retain growth rate. Prepare a thin blood smear as described below and examine parasite maturation under a light microscope. 3. Thin Blood Film Slide Preparation Place approximately 10-15 μl of blood on one end of a frosted glass slide resting on a flat surface. Touch the drop of blood with the edge of a second slide until the blood is evenly spread across the edge of the second slide. While holding the second slide at a 45° angle, quickly but gently, without exerting too much pressure on the first slide, slide the blood across the first slide to make a thin film of blood that is evenly spread. Air dry. Dip the slide in methanol for 10 sec. Air dry. Dip the slide in 2% Giemsa stain for at least 10 min. Rinse extensively until the water runs clear. Air dry. Examine slide using a 90-100x oil emulsion lens on a light microscope 4. Purification and Synchronization of Asexual Stages The purification of mature P. falciparum pRBC is a required step for the clumping assay. Indeed, only mature parasites are capable of binding to platelet receptors as it is at this life cycle stage that the relevant ligands are expressed and protrude from the surface of infected erythrocytes. There are several methods to purify and synchronize asexual stages of P. falciparum. : Late asexual stages can be enriched by Percoll gradient 19 ; magnetic cell sorting 20 or using the gelatin sedimentation 21 protocol described here. Sorbitol-synchronization selects for ring stages 22 , after which the rings are cultured for 24-26 hr to obtain mature stages (with no need to perform gelatin flotation). 4.1 Plasmagel Flotation Plasmagel flotation uses gelatin-like solution to select for lower weight knobbed erythrocytes to remain in solution while the dense ring forms and rosettes sink to the bottom. This technique gives up to 90% purity of the mature stage-infected erythrocytes and can be used for both field and laboratory isolates. However, as previously mentioned, plasmagel flotation removes rosetting pRBC as well as immature stages which could result in a reduced clumping frequency in those samples with a high rosetting frequency. However, the absence of the rosetting pRBC after plasmagel flotation would not affect the clumping assay because rosetting is an interaction of pRBC and uninfected erythrocytes while clumping is pRBCs binding mediated by platelets. The ligand involved in these two traits is different; with mainly complement receptor CR-1 on uninfected erythrocytes mediating rosetting. Prewarm Gelofusine solution and serum/Albumax II-free medium to 37 °C in a water bath. Transfer culture to a clean sterile 15 ml tube and pellet cells by centrifugation at room temperature at 370 x g for 5 min. Carefully aspirate supernatant so as not to disturb the pellet and resuspend cells in an equal volume of Gelofusine and protein-free medium. Transfer mixture to a sterile 15 ml tube and allow to stand for 15-20 min in a 37 °C incubator or until a clear demarcation can be seen between an upper and lower level. Carefully transfer the upper layer to a fresh sterile 15 ml tube and add 10 ml of fresh RPMI. Centrifuge at 370 x g for 5 min and carefully discard supernatant. Assess parasitaemia and developmental stage by thin blood smear and examine under a light microscope as described in section 4. NOTE: Mature pRBC range between 60-90% of infected erythrocytes depending on the initial parasitaemia of the culture. For high percentage of mature parasites, use cultures with an initial parasitaemia of ≥10%. 5. Clumping Assay Use a Neubauer's haematocytometer to count and adjust the pRBC suspension obtained after plasmagel flotation to 1 x 10 8 pRBC/μl. In a fresh 1.5 ml tube, resuspend pRBC at 5% hematocrit, acridine orange at 20 μg/ml final concentration and PRP at 10% of the total volume. Instead of acridine orange, parasite cultures can be stained with 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 5 min before use. E.g. For a 200 μl reaction mix, add 10 μl mature pRBC, 20 μl of 300 x 10 3 platelets/μl for PRP from healthy donors or 150 x 10 3 platelets/μl from SM patients and 170 μl of protein-free medium. NOTE: The ratio of platelets:pRBC in the final reactions is 20:1. This is important as is allows the maximum clumping frequency of a sample to be determined. If fewer platelets are added in controls then not all clumping pRBCs might have the chance to clump. In the same way prepare the following controls; uninfected red blood cells and PRP, and pRBC with PPP to ascertain the role of platelets in the pRBCs clumping. Transfer the suspension to a 1.5-2.0 ml conical screw-cap vial. Place the vial under gentle agitation by rolling at 10-12 rpm at room temperature. Check for clump formation by a wet-slide prepared by pipetting 10 μl of pRBC ± platelet mix on a glass slide, cover with a glass slip and examine under fluorescence. Sampling can be done at 15-20 min intervals for a total of 120 min. A clump is considered as an aggregate of three or more infected erythrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cell-derived blood-generating heart-forming organoids (BG-HFOs) represent a highly structured in vitro model that recapitulates aspects of human cardiac, hematoendothelial and multiwave hematopoietic co-development. Our model offers novel insights into human development and represents a potent tool for disease modeling, drug testing and other advanced in vitro assays. Here we provide a detailed 14-d protocol for the generation of BG-HFOs, from the embedding of hPS cell-derived aggregates in Matrigel, directing cell differentiation via WNT pathway modulation and supplementation of cytokine cocktails required for hematoendothelial induction and maturation. The protocol is robust and applicable to different hPS cell lines. Proper formation and patterning of the multiple tissues present in the BG-HFOs can be assessed through techniques such as live-cell imaging, whole-mount immunofluorescence (IF) staining, flow cytometry and gene-expression analysis. The efficient generation of BG-HFOs requires hands-on experience with hPS cell culture and the simultaneous management of multiple medium-enriching growth factors and small molecules. We additionally highlight a simple, scalable method of sample preparation for the effective investigation of BG-HFO morphology via laser microscopy using common laboratory equipment. This Protocol requires basic skills in handling hazardous chemicals and limited experience in IF staining and laser microscopy. Our robust and fast method enables the whole-mount IF staining and clearing of large organoids (up to 4 mm in diameter) composed of multiple tissues (with different physical properties) such as BG-HFOs and other complex organoid models in 2.5 d. The described workflow can thus promote fast laser microscopy, thereby tackling a major challenge in the field.",

    "title": "Streamlined Intravital Imaging Approach for Long-Term Monitoring of Epithelial Tissue Dynamics on an Inverted Confocal Microscope.",
    "abstract": "Understanding normal and aberrant in vivo cell behaviors is necessary to develop clinical interventions to thwart disease initiation and progression. It is therefore critical to optimize imaging approaches that facilitate the observation of cell dynamics in situ, where tissue structure and composition remain unperturbed. The epidermis is the body's outermost barrier, as well as the source of the most prevalent human cancers, namely cutaneous skin carcinomas. The accessibility of skin tissue presents a unique opportunity to monitor epithelial and dermal cell behaviors in intact animals using noninvasive intravital microscopy. Nevertheless, this sophisticated imaging approach has primarily been achieved using upright multiphoton microscopes, which represent a significant barrier for entry for most investigators. This study presents a custom-designed, 3D-printed microscope stage insert suitable for use with inverted confocal microscopes, streamlining the long-term intravital imaging of ear skin in live transgenic mice. We believe this versatile invention, which may be customized to fit the inverted microscope brand and model of choice and adapted to image additional organ systems, will prove invaluable to the greater scientific research community by significantly enhancing the accessibility of intravital microscopy. This technological advancement is critical for bolstering our understanding of live cell dynamics in normal and disease contexts.",

    "title": "Imaging Microtubules in vitro at High Resolution while Preserving their Structure.",
    "abstract": "Microtubules (MT) are the most rigid component of the cytoskeleton. Nevertheless, they often appear highly curved in the cellular context and the mechanisms governing their overall shape are poorly understood. Currently, in vitro microtubule analysis relies primarily on electron microscopy for its high resolution and Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy for its ability to image live fluorescently-labelled microtubules and associated proteins. For three-dimensional analyses of microtubules with micrometer curvatures, we have developed an assay in which MTs are polymerized in vitro from MT seeds adhered to a glass slide in a manner similar to conventional TIRF microscopy protocols. Free fluorescent molecules are removed and the MTs are fixed by perfusion. The MTs can then be observed using a confocal microscope with an Airyscan module for higher resolution. This protocol allows the imaging of microtubules that have retained their original three-dimensional shape and is compatible with high-resolution immunofluorescence detection.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this protocol is to study mitochondria within intraepidermal nerve fibers. Therefore, 3D imaging and analysis techniques were developed to isolate nerve-specific mitochondria and evaluate disease-induced alterations of mitochondria in the distal tip of sensory nerves. The protocol combines fluorescence immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and 3D image analysis techniques to visualize and quantify nerve-specific mitochondria. Detailed parameters are defined throughout the procedures in order to provide a concrete example of how to use these techniques to isolate nerve-specific mitochondria. Antibodies were used to label nerve and mitochondrial signals within tissue sections of skin punch biopsies, which was followed by indirect immunofluorescence to visualize nerves and mitochondria with a green and red fluorescent signal respectively. Z-series images were acquired with confocal microscopy and 3D analysis software was used to process and analyze the signals. It is not necessary to follow the exact parameters described within, but it is important to be consistent with the ones chosen throughout the staining, acquisition and analysis steps. The strength of this protocol is that it is applicable to a wide variety of circumstances where one fluorescent signal is used to isolate other signals that would otherwise be impossible to study alone.",

This method enables high-precision single-molecule imaging throughout the full cell volume using DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) without the need for custom optics or complex illumination schemes. The protocol provides a stepwise guide on configuring a commercially available spinning disk microscope (e.g., CSU-W1 SoRA) for SMLM imaging, including acquisition parameters optimized for deep imaging. Sample preparation steps are outlined for labeling intracellular targets with DNA-conjugated probes to perform DNA-PAINT imaging, including strategies for multicolor imaging of several targets. Image acquisition is followed by single-molecule localization and reconstruction using standard software packages. Critical considerations for minimizing background, optimizing lateral resolution, and ensuring imaging quality across the full cell depth are also discussed. This accessible protocol allows researchers to perform deep, whole-cell SMLM using standard confocal equipment, expanding the range of biological questions addressable by single-molecule imaging beyond the near-membrane regions.",

    "title": "Manipulation and Analysis of Cell Cycle-Dependent Processes in Budding Yeast.",
    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells follow a conserved cell cycle that regulates diverse processes, including DNA maintenance and organelle homeostasis. Studying cellular processes in a cell cycle-dependent manner is often necessary to properly interpret experimental results. There are chemical and genetic methods available to produce cell cycle synchronization in cultured cells across a wide swath of organisms, including vertebrate models, enabling the study of cell cycle-dependent processes. However, among model organisms, budding yeast remains a powerhouse for cell cycle analysis due to its particularly robust synchronization methods, short generation time, and genetic tractability. Yeast shares core cell cycle machinery with other eukaryotes, which has enabled landmark discoveries in cell cycle regulation. This protocol details methods for cell cycle analysis in yeast, focusing on G1 arrest-release and mitotic arrest-release experiments, including strain construction, culture preparation, and microscopy. PCR tagging methods for producing suitable strains for cell cycle arrests and fluorescence microscopy are presented. A G1 arrest is achieved using the peptide pheromone α-factor, and brief washes result in synchronous release and cell cycle progression. Samples are taken at different time points following release into the cell cycle and fixed for microscopy. A second method arrests yeast cells in mitosis by depleting the cell cycle regulator Cdc20 to achieve a metaphase-arrested population, as well as optional release into anaphase. Samples are fixed and prepared for imaging pre- and post-release, and are imaged and analyzed. Image analysis focuses on cataloging dynamic localization and population abundance changes of proteins in the cell cycle. These synchronization methods are suitable for diverse cell cycle manipulations, and while their use in imaging fixed cells is highlighted here, they can be adapted for many other analyses, including live cell imaging as well as biochemical and molecular assays.",

    "title": "Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Tomography in Virology: 3D Imaging of High-pressure Frozen, Freeze-substituted Samples.",
    "abstract": "Electron microscopy (EM) and especially three-dimensional (3D) EM techniques have become established methods in structural virology. Investigation of virus-induced alteration of the cellular ultrastructure, such as Zika virus (ZIKV)-induced replication factories or coronavirus replication organelles, demands 3D imaging. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomography is a widely used method, despite its limitation to samples with a thickness of up to 200 nm. Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-tomography can produce 3D data of larger volumes with isotropic, albeit typically lower resolution. Alternative techniques, such as block face-scanning electron microscopy (BF-SEM), SEM array tomography, or TEM imaging of serial sections are used for imaging of larger volumes. However, compared to the previously mentioned techniques, these techniques come at the cost of much lower resolution along the Z-axis of the sample. A technique that provides 3D information of samples up to 1 µm thickness with isotropic resolution of a few nanometers is scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography. Here, we present a protocol for the preparation of high-pressure frozen, freeze-substituted, and resin-embedded virological specimens and their analysis using STEM tomography. This protocol benefits from the advantages of room temperature imaging while preserving the biological ultrastructure in a near-native state. We show two representative examples for questions that can be answered using STEM tomography. First, we apply the protocol for studying virion morphogenesis of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The STEM tomograms offer information on recombinant VSV budding that is otherwise not accessible by 2D imaging. Second, we show correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) using Foerster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging and STEM tomography (FRET-3D-CLEM) of EF-C peptide nanofibrils. This recently published combination gives new insights into the uptake and disassembly of infection-enhancing peptide nanofibrils, especially profiting from the large volume that is accessible by STEM tomography.",

    "abstract": "Filter-aided expansion proteomics (FAXP) is a spatial proteomics approach designed for high-resolution analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Here we describe the integration of hydrogel-based tissue expansion with mass spectrometry, enabling isotropic expansion and robust protein retention while preserving spatial features. The FAXP workflow consists of several sequential steps, including tissue section dewaxing, in situ protein anchoring, hydrogel embedding, homogenization, staining, isotropic expansion, microdissection and filter-aided in-gel digestion to maximize peptide recovery. The Protocol integrates laser capture microdissection, enabling the precise isolation of single cells and subcellular components for subcellular spatial proteomics analysis. The approach achieves up to a fivefold linear expansion factor of FFPE tissue, including extracellular matrix-rich samples such as colorectal cancer, with less than 6% distortion, enabling the identification of an average of 2,368 proteins from single mouse liver nucleus shape and 3,312 proteins from single mouse liver cell shape using an Astral mass spectrometer. The method is compatible with diverse tissue types, including extracellular matrix-rich specimens, and integrates seamlessly with imaging workflows, such as immunostaining, for spatially resolved proteomic analysis. FAXP enables researchers to obtain comprehensive proteomic profiles with strong reproducibility and high sensitivity. The entire workflow takes ~27 h and requires only commercially available reagents and supplies and is thus accessible for researchers with intermediate expertise in tissue processing, microscopy and proteomics. FAXP can advance spatial proteomics-based studies, in particular of cancer heterogeneity, neurodegenerative diseases and cellular microenvironments within FFPE tissues, including archival clinical samples.",

    "title": "Imaging Approaches to Assessments of Toxicological Oxidative Stress Using Genetically-encoded Fluorogenic Sensors.",
    "abstract": "While oxidative stress is a commonly cited toxicological mechanism, conventional methods to study it suffer from a number of shortcomings, including destruction of the sample, introduction of potential artifacts, and a lack of specificity for the reactive species involved. Thus, there is a current need in the field of toxicology for non-destructive, sensitive, and specific methods that can be used to observe and quantify intracellular redox perturbations, more commonly referred to as oxidative stress. Here, we present a method for the use of two genetically-encoded fluorogenic sensors, roGFP2 and HyPer, to be used in live-cell imaging studies to observe xenobiotic-induced oxidative responses. roGFP2 equilibrates with the glutathione redox potential (EGSH), while HyPer directly detects hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Both sensors can be expressed into various cell types via transfection or transduction, and can be targeted to specific cellular compartments. Most importantly, live-cell microscopy using these sensors offers high spatial and temporal resolution that is not possible using conventional methods. Changes in the fluorescence intensity monitored at 510 nm serves as the readout for both genetically-encoded fluorogenic sensors when sequentially excited by 404 nm and 488 nm light. This property makes both sensors ratiometric, eliminating common microscopy artifacts and correcting for differences in sensor expression between cells. This methodology can be applied across a variety of fluorometric platforms capable of exciting and collecting emissions at the prescribed wavelengths, making it suitable for use with confocal imaging systems, conventional wide-field microscopy, and plate readers. Both genetically-encoded fluorogenic sensors have been used in a variety of cell types and toxicological studies to monitor cellular EGSH and H2O2 generation in real-time. Outlined here is a standardized method that is widely adaptable across cell types and fluorometric platforms for the application of roGFP2 and HyPer in live-cell toxicological assessments of oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Centrosome numerical abnormalities have been reported in a variety of tumors. Centrosome numbers in cancer cells display both inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity. The over production of centrosomes (centrosome amplification) is unique in cancer cells and is a promising target for therapy. Thus, a method to quantify centrosome numbers on a single cell level is needed. Here, we describe a protocol to quantify centrosome numbers in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples by multiplexing antibodies to define bona fide centrosomes and cell borders. Centrosomes in single cells are identified using high resolution immunofluorescent microscopy with Z-sectioning. This protocol is easy to perform and has been used to quantify centrosome numbers on a single cell level in a variety of human tissue samples.",

    "title": "Workflow Using a Cryogenic Coincident Fluorescence, Electron, and Ion Beam Microscope for Targeted Milling of Cells.",
    "abstract": "Cryogenic focused ion beam milling with scanning electron microscopy (CryoFIB-SEM) has become the dominant approach for preparing sub-200-nm thick lamellae of cells for cryogenic electron tomography (CryoET). Recently, fluorescence microscopy has been incorporated into CryoFIB-SEM systems to guide lamella production toward fluorescently labeled targets. However, in most implementations, the optical and ion beam imaging systems have distinct focal planes in different regions of the vacuum chamber-functioning effectively as two separate microscopes. This configuration requires image registration between modalities, which often lacks the accuracy needed to reliably target small, rare structures in situ. We present a workflow based on a customized tri-coincident imaging platform that enables simultaneous fluorescence imaging and focused ion beam milling. This allows for real-time fluorescence feedback that can be used to determine when to terminate milling in order to preserve fluorescently labeled structures of interest in the final lamella. Using this approach, we targeted the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in vitrified macrophages and achieved a >60% success rate, confirmed by subsequent cryogenic electron tomography and correlative light and electron microscopy.",

    "title": "Tracking Single Proteins in Lipid Bilayers Using Fluorescence Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Direct observation is a fundamental method for scientific discovery and understanding. Time-lapse single-molecule fluorescence imaging allows the observation of individual proteins as they move and interact with their surroundings, making states that would normally be hidden in ensemble measurements visible. Single-protein tracking is especially suited for studying membrane proteins, where its two-dimensional nature enables fast, wide-field imaging with single-fluorophore sensitivity. Using artificial lipid bilayers that mimic membranes where transmembrane or peripheral membrane proteins are found (such as plasma membranes or membranes of intracellular organelles from various cell types) permits measurement of specific interactions in near-native environments. It also allows for the gradual addition of complexity, one component at a time, while suppressing background interference from fluorescence and Raman scattering. By adding temperature control, it becomes possible to determine the thermodynamic properties of single-particle interactions as well. In this work, we describe a protocol for sample preparation, data collection, single-molecule fluorescence tracking, and analysis of membrane protein trajectories in lipid bilayers using Aquaporin-4. This work serves as a foundational example and can be adapted to different proteins and bilayer compositions.",

    "abstract": "Different viruses rely on direct cell-to-cell transmission to propagate infection within the infected host. Measuring this mode of transmission in cultured cells is often complicated by the contribution of cell free viruses to spread, and the difficulty to distinguish between primary infected cells that produce the virus and neighboring cells that are the target of spreading. Here, we present a protocol to quantify cell-to-cell transmission of the model pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus that is based on the co-culture of producer cells that are infected with a reporter virus expressing mCherry and target cells that stably express GFP. Spread of cell-free viruses is blocked by the presence of a neutralizing antibody in the cell culture medium, and cell-associated transmission is unequivocally quantified by numbering cells that are positive for both GFP and mCherry using automated analysis of fluorescence microscopy images.",

    "title": "Radial mobility and cytotoxic function of retroviral replicating vector transduced, non-adherent alloresponsive T lymphocytes.",
    "abstract": "We report a novel adaptation of the Radial Monolayer Cell Migration assay, first reported to measure the radial migration of adherent tumor cells on extracellular matrix proteins, for measuring the motility of fluorescently-labeled, non-adherent human or murine effector immune cells. This technique employs a stainless steel manifold and 10-well Teflon slide to focally deposit non-adherent T cells into wells prepared with either confluent tumor cell monolayers or extracellular matrix proteins. Light and/or multi-channel fluorescence microscopy is used to track the movement and behavior of the effector cells over time. Fluorescent dyes and/or viral vectors that code for fluorescent transgenes are used to differentially label the cell types for imaging. This method is distinct from similar-type in vitro assays that track horizontal or vertical migration/invasion utilizing slide chambers, agar or transwell plates. The assay allows detailed imaging data to be collected with different cell types distinguished by specific fluorescent markers; even specific subpopulations of cells (i.e., transduced/nontransduced) can be monitored. Surface intensity fluorescence plots are generated using specific fluorescence channels that correspond to the migrating cell type. This allows for better visualization of the non-adherent immune cell mobility at specific times. It is possible to gather evidence of other effector cell functions, such as cytotoxicity or transfer of viral vectors from effector to target cells, as well. Thus, the method allows researchers to microscopically document cell-to-cell interactions of differentially-labeled, non-adherent with adherent cells of various types. Such information may be especially relevant in the assessment of biologically-manipulated or activated immune cell types, where visual proof of functionality is desired with tumor target cells before their use for cancer therapy.",

    "title": "Transsynaptic tracing techniques to interrogate neuronal connectivity of glioblastomas.",
    "abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBMs) functionally integrate into diverse neuronal circuits within the central nervous system, which can promote tumor progression and affect neurons via neuron-to-glioma synapses. It remains challenging to identify and manipulate tumor-innervating neurons, which may remain localized or widely distributed throughout the brain. Building on GBM organoids (GBOs) derived from patient-resected surgical tissue, we present here detailed procedures for assessing interactions between tumors and neurons. We first discuss retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing approaches to study the neuron-tumor connectome by using a rabies viral system in ex vivo human tissue and in xenogenic animal models. As a complementary approach, we then describe the use of anterograde transsynaptic tracing using herpes simplex virus in vivo and ex vivo to assess brain region-specific connectivity in GBMs. In addition, to facilitate the adaptability of these tracing methodologies in diverse systems, we provide procedures for the viral transduction into GBOs, the generation of assembloids comprising GBOs and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids and the establishment of air-liquid interface cultures from surgical human brain tissue. Together, these techniques permit the flexible characterization and manipulation of tumor-neural circuits and can be easily adapted to other cancers with nervous system involvement. After the generation of GBOs and/or cortical organoids, transsynaptic tracing requires 12-35 d to complete ex vivo or in vivo. The procedure is suitable for users with expertise in human cell and organoid culture, viral production and transduction, rodent surgery and microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Complex cellular interactions determine functional and structural tissue remodeling during reperfused acute myocardial infarction (repAMI). These processes show distinct spatial distribution as the injured heart muscle is segmented into different areas (damage area, area at risk (AAR), and remote area). Three-dimensional (3D) visualization of these areas is essential for the analysis of various interactions between resident cardiac cells and infiltrating immune cells, enabling the identification of possible treatment targets. Here, a protocol is described for simultaneous and automatable 3D visualization and quantification of the cardiac damage area, AAR, and infiltrating immune cells (e.g., neutrophils) after repAMI. This includes intravital antibody-mediated staining of cardiac damage area (CD31neg) and neutrophil infiltration (Ly6G+) following ex vivo visualization of AAR by retrograde antibody perfusion and further non-toxic tissue clearing for light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) imaging. This technique allows the spatial analysis of target cells, e.g., infiltrating immune cells and damaged areas in an intact mouse heart after repAMI. Traditional histology and immunohistochemistry can be performed after non-toxic tissue clearing and image acquisition with computer-assisted post-processing. This allows multiplexing information gain within the same mouse heart, strengthening data robustness and being especially significant in a highly complex injury like repAMI.",

The observation of specific cellular structures or organelles depends significantly on the method of fixation applied to the sample, notably through the use of aldehyde-based chemical crosslinkers and protein precipitation with cold methanol. Recently, integrating cryo-fixation -- a gold-standard fixation technique -- with the U-ExM method has enabled nanoscale observations of a wide range of biological samples, from cultured mammalian cells to whole organisms, in their near-native state. Expansion microscopy is a powerful tool for studying biological structures across scales, from isolated organelles to entire tissues. When combined with cryo-fixation, it provides unprecedented insights into cellular architecture and dynamic processes while minimizing artifacts associated with traditional fixation methods. These developments position ExM as a versatile framework for high-resolution, near-native biological imaging. The present study outlines a detailed protocol for cryo-fixation coupled with expansion microscopy of samples from various origins. This protocol highlights critical steps, including sample fixation, polymer formation, expansion, immunostaining, and imaging, providing the necessary guidance to implement this method in any laboratory.",

    "title": "Intravital Longitudinal Imaging of Vascular Dynamics in the Calvarial Bone Marrow.",
    "abstract": "Intravital longitudinal fluorescence microscopy imaging has emerged as a crucial technique for studying dynamic biological processes, notably in the context of tissue regeneration, tumor development, and therapeutic responses. Particularly, the calvarial bone marrow is a highly dynamic tissue, where the hematopoietic fate is interconnected with the surrounding microenvironment, with specialized vessels responding to normal and pathologic hematopoiesis. Traditional imaging of fixed tissues offers static information, often limiting a comprehensive understanding of these processes. The integration of transgenic animals expressing cell-specific markers, live cell tracers, advancements in imaging equipment, and the use of specialized chambers has elevated intravital microscopy to a pivotal tool for gaining insights into dynamic biological phenomena. One application of intravital imaging is the investigation of tumor vessel behavior and therapeutic effects. A newly designed 3D-printed titanium head fixation implant can be stably connected to the mouse skull and is suitable for longitudinal imaging during multiple sessions. The proposed protocol allows for the spatial and temporal examination of vascular dynamics in the calvarial bone marrow, including visualization and quantification of vascular heterogeneity, interaction with stromal and hematopoietic cells, and measurement of vascular functional parameters. Additionally, the technique enables the visualization of established vascular beds and the monitoring of therapeutic effects, stem cell mobilization, and the localization of chemotherapeutic compounds over time using two-photon microscopy. Overall, this intravital longitudinal imaging protocol provides a comprehensive platform for investigating both tumor vessel behavior and hematopoietic cell dynamics, offering valuable insights into the intricate processes governing these biological phenomena.",

    "title": "Assessment of Mitochondrial Fission/Fusion Dynamics in Kidney Proximal Tubular Cells.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria are best recognized for their role in ATP synthesis and serve as key regulators of cellular metabolism. Mitochondrial dynamics comprehend the intracellular and intercellular movement of mitochondria, as well as the processes of fission/fusion. These events are fundamental to maintaining mitochondrial function by maintaining cellular homeostasis, morphology, bioenergetics, quality control, and stress responses. On the other hand, dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics impacts cellular morphology and function. Precise measurement of mitochondria fission/fusion events can be indicative of cellular health. Current methodologies to measure mitochondria dynamics employ advanced imaging like super-resolution microscopy, fluorescence techniques (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)) for connectivity, and optogenetic tools for spatiotemporal control. Quantitative analysis utilizes computational tools to measure parameters like length, number, and branching, which indicate fission/fusion balance. However, these methods require skills and sophisticated instruments. In this article, we describe the use of confocal microscopy combined with free-to-use tools in ImageJ (Fiji) to study fission/fusion events using the photo-switching property of the dendra2 protein, tagged to mitochondrial cytochrome c.",

    "abstract": "Here, we present an integrated suite of protocols for the cultivation, quantitative monitoring, structural and functional characterization of Leptospira spp. biofilms over time. This workflow combines crystal violet microtiter assays to measure biofilm biomass at multiple time points, with a time-resolved fractionation approach that distinguishes attached (biofilm) and non-attached (liquid-phase) bacterial populations, time-lapse phase-contrast imaging for non-destructive kinetic observation, confocal laser-scanning microscopy to generate full 3D reconstructions with matrix-probe readouts, and membrane-supported scanning electron microscopy for ultrastructural analysis. In parallel, we detail a standardized procedure for harvesting intact biofilm aggregates and preparing them for intraperitoneal injection into the susceptible golden Syrian hamster model, enabling direct assessment of biofilm-associated virulence in vivo alongside matched planktonic controls. Optimized for the pathogenic strain Leptospira interrogans Manilae L495, each module is readily transferable to other Leptospira species and mutant libraries to compare biofilm-forming capacity. Together, these coordinated modules provide a robust foundation for screening anti-biofilm strategies, probing genetic determinants, and clarifying the contribution of biofilms to Leptospira persistence and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Calcium imaging is crucial for studying neural dynamics and brain function. However, current methods for imaging calcium in Drosophila larvae are challenging due to motion artifacts and specialized equipment needs. Here, we present a practical, low-cost method for performing both in vivo and ex vivo calcium imaging in third-instar Drosophila larvae, using a topical tissue adhesive for immobilizing samples. We also provide custom R scripts and a framework for data analysis, facilitating measurements of calcium changes under different experimental conditions. Using this approach, we successfully recorded calcium transients in a pair of larval CNS neurons with minimal motion artifacts, demonstrating reproducibility across preparations. The method is compatible with standard spinning disk confocal systems and can be adapted for DIY or commercial two-photon setups, making it accessible to laboratories with different resources. This approach may increase accessibility to larval calcium imaging studies and can be adapted to examine the effects of both external stimuli, such as odors, and internal stimuli, such as neuromodulators.",

    "title": "Labeling Endogenous Proteins Using CRISPR-mediated Insertion of Exon (CRISPIE).",
    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 technology has transformed our ability to edit eukaryotic genomes. Despite this breakthrough, it remains challenging to precisely knock-in large DNA sequences, such as those encoding a fluorescent protein, for labeling or modifying a target protein in post-mitotic cells. Previous efforts focusing on sequence insertion to the protein coding sequence often suffer from insertions/deletions (INDELs) resulting from the efficient non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ). To overcome this limitation, we have developed CRISPR-mediated insertion of exon (CRISPIE). CRISPIE circumvents INDELs and other editing errors by inserting a designer exon flanked by adjacent intron sequences into an appropriate intronic location of the targeted gene. Because INDELs at the insertion junction can be spliced out, \"CRISPIEd\" genes produce precisely edited mRNA transcripts that are virtually error-free. In part due to the elimination of INDELs, high-efficiency labeling can be achieved in vivo. CRISPIE is compatible with both N- and C-terminal labels, and with all common transfection methods. Importantly, CRISPIE allows for later removal of the protein modification by including exogenous single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sites in the intronic region of the donor module. This protocol provides the detailed CRISPIE methodology, using endogenous labeling of β-actin in human U-2 OS cells with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as an example. When combined with the appropriate gene delivery methods, the same methodology can be applied to label post-mitotic neurons in culture and in vivo. This methodology can also be readily adapted for use in other gene editing contexts.",

    "title": "Microvascular Embolism Mouse Model for In Vivo Two-photon Microscopy Using Fluorescent Polystyrene Microspheres.",
    "abstract": "Microvascular occlusions in the brain are relatively common but remain largely understudied. The event rate, long-term consequences, and potential clearing mechanisms are largely unknown. Current models used to study these events, such as photothrombosis and micro-emboli injection, each have their own advantages and limitations. This study developed a detailed protocol that combines the preparation of a chronic cranial window with the induction of cerebral microvascular embolisms via intra-arterial injection of microspheres in mice. This setup allows for long-term in vivo imaging of the micro-vasculature and micro-occlusions using two-photon microscopy. Microspheres are delivered through a catheter placed in the external carotid artery (ECA), which is permanently ligated. Importantly, the common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) remain intact throughout and after the procedure, thereby minimizing disturbance to cerebral blood flow. To facilitate immediate in vivo imaging and prevent microsphere clustering or adhesion to pipette tips and the catheter, microspheres are suspended in a mixture of FITC-Dextran and 0.1% Tween 20. The injection technique was validated using post mortem in situ 3D imaging to determine the microspheres' distribution. This study further demonstrates its utility with an in vivo two-photon microscopy example. This approach provides a consistent and robust method for inducing and studying microvascular embolisms, enabling investigation of their impact and clearance dynamics using high-resolution in vivo imaging.",

    "title": "Ultra-high Information-content Chemical Imaging with Broadband Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman and Two-photon Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Raman fingerprint spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging are emerging tools for studying metabolic profiles of biological specimens. While Raman fingerprint spectroscopy detects intrinsic molecular vibrations that reflect the molecular composition and chemical environment of a sample, fluorescence lifetime imaging measures changes in the excited-state lifetime of fluorophores that are sensitive to their microenvironments. Here, we present a multimodal imaging platform combining broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2p-FLIM) microscopy that can acquire biologically relevant Raman fingerprint spectra and fluorescence lifetime signals in vivo and simultaneously. The tremendous chemical information obtained from spatially co-registered BCARS and 2p-FLIM images allows us to characterize the subtle differences between sub-cellular compartments and verify the potential false-positive results generated by fluorescence imaging alone. This is demonstrated by directly comparing the BCARS, 2p-FLIM, and two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) signals simultaneously obtained from the same dye-stained organelle in the live, intact C. elegans expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker. In this work, we introduce the BCARS/2p-FLIM/TPEF setup scheme, the image acquisition steps, data processing, and representative results showing that the cross-modality imaging method enables rigorous characterization and in vivo detection at sub-cellular resolution. This protocol provides a framework for simultaneous chemical and fluorescence lifetime imaging to improve the accuracy of biological interpretation in complex living systems.",

    "title": "Live-Cell Förster Resonance Energy Transfer Imaging of Metabolically Regulated Akt Activation Dynamics in HepG2 Cells.",
    "abstract": "Metabolically regulated Akt activation is a critical node in the insulin signaling cascade and provides valuable insights into the relationship between diabetes and cancer. To precisely quantify Akt activity in HepG2 cells, we developed a robust, reproducible protocol utilizing Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) with genetically encoded Akt-specific biosensors. This protocol outlines detailed steps for cell culture, imaging dish preparation, and transfection of HepG2 cells to express FRET-based biosensors, alongside specific guidelines for laser scanning confocal microscope hardware and software configuration. The results demonstrated unique patterns of insulin signaling in HepG2 cells, which exhibit an irreversible switch characterized by constitutive Akt activation with a defined switch-on threshold but no switch-off threshold. In contrast, myotubes display a reversible switch. The persistent Akt activation in HepG2 cells suggests mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation in hepatic cells, with broader implications for understanding the progression of metabolic disorders and cancer. This protocol offers a valuable framework for exploring Akt-related signaling pathways and cellular behaviors across various disease contexts.",

    "title": "Visualizing Intracellular Sialylation with Click Chemistry and Expansion Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic labeling techniques allow the incorporation of bioorthogonal reporters into glycans, enabling the targeted bioconjugation of molecular dyes within cells through click and bioorthogonal chemistry. Metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) has attracted considerable interest due to the essential role of glycosylation in numerous biological processes that involve molecular recognition and its impact on pathologies ranging from cancer to genetic disorders to viral and bacterial infections. Although MOE is better known for the detection of cell surface glycoconjugates, it is also a very important methodology for the study of intracellular glycans in physiological and pathological contexts. Such studies greatly benefit from high spatial resolution. However, super-resolution microscopy is not readily available in most laboratories and poses challenges for daily implementation. Expansion microscopy is a recent alternative that enhances the resolution of microscopy by physically enlarging biological specimens labeled with fluorescent markers. By embedding the sample in a swellable gel and causing it to expand isotropically through chemical treatment, subcellular structures can be visualized with enhanced precision and resolution without the need for super-resolution techniques. In this work, we illustrate the capacity of expansion microscopy to visualize intracellular sialylated glycans through the combined use of MOE and click chemistry. Specifically, we propose a procedure for bioorthogonal labeling and expansion microscopy that employs a reporter targeting sialylation, which may be associated with immunofluorescence for co-localization studies. This protocol enables localization studies of sialoconjugate biosynthesis, intracellular trafficking, and recycling.",

    "title": "Laminectomy and Spinal Cord Window Implantation in the Mouse.",
    "abstract": "This protocol describes a method for spinal cord laminectomy and glass window implantation for in vivo imaging of the mouse spinal cord. An integrated digital vaporizer is utilized to achieve a stable plane of anesthesia at a low-flow rate of isoflurane. A single vertebral spine is removed, and a commercially available cover-glass is overlaid on a thin agarose bed. A 3D-printed plastic backplate is then affixed to the adjacent vertebral spines using tissue adhesive and dental cement. A stabilization platform is used to reduce motion artifact from respiration and heartbeat. This rapid and clamp-free method is well-suited for acute multi-photon fluorescence microscopy. Representative data are included for an application of this technique to two-photon microscopy of the spinal cord vasculature in transgenic mice expressing eGFP:Claudin-5 - a tight junction protein.",

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation during oocyte meiosis is essential for ensuring proper embryonic development and preventing aneuploidy-related disorders. Live-cell imaging combined with fluorescence labelling techniques have become a powerful approach for studying meiotic chromosome dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. In this protocol, we summarize key methodologies for visualizing chromosome segregation in live mouse oocytes, focusing on the use of histone H2B-RFP for chromatin labelling and SiR-Tubulin for spindle tracking. We describe the procedures for sample preparation, mRNA microinjection, oocyte culture, live-cell imaging chamber setup, and confocal microscopy settings, all optimized to achieve high-resolution imaging while minimizing phototoxicity. Furthermore, we highlight critical experimental considerations such as phototoxicity, image processing, and quantitative analysis of meiotic events. By providing a comprehensive evaluation of current methodologies, this protocol serves as a practical guide for researchers seeking to investigate chromosome dynamics in live oocytes and improve the accuracy and reproducibility of meiotic studies.",

    "title": "Live-cell Imaging of Endocytic Transport using Functionalized Nanobodies in Cultured Cells.",
    "abstract": "Endocytosis of receptors and other transmembrane proteins from the cell surface to endosomes and beyond is critical for homeostasis, physiology, and function. To investigate endocytic uptake and retrograde protein trafficking, we have established a versatile toolkit comprising functionalized nanobodies to monitor transport from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by means of fixed and live-cell imaging, electron microscopy, and gel electrophoresis combined with autoradiography. We developed derivatized nanobodies targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP) or mCherry - monomeric, non-crosslinking, high-affinity protein binders - that can be added to cell lines expressing membrane proteins of interest bearing the corresponding extracellular fluorescence tags. Upon binding to GFP- or mCherry-tagged transmembrane reporters, the nanobodies are specifically internalized and trafficked in parallel with the reporters' endogenous sorting routes. These nanobodies were functionalized with selected fluorophores to track retrograde transport by fluorescence microscopy and live imaging, with ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2) to resolve ultrastructural localization by electron microscopy, and with tyrosine sulfation motifs to quantitatively assess TGN arrival kinetics. In this methodological study, we detail the general protocol for bacterial expression and purification of functionalized nanobodies, as well as the generation of stable GFP-reporter cell lines. We exemplify the utility of this approach for live-cell imaging by employing an mCherry-modified anti-GFP nanobody (VHH-mCherry) to analyze the endocytic uptake of the transferrin receptor (TfR) and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CDMPR).",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish larvae are a promising vertebrate model system for studying the neural mechanisms of behavior. Their translucence and relatively simple neural circuitry facilitate the use of optogenetic techniques in cellular analyses of behavior. Fluorescent indicators of in vivo neural activity, such as GCaMP6s, have been widely used to study the neural activity associated with simple behaviors in larval zebrafish. Here, we present a protocol for detecting sensory-induced activity in semi-restrained zebrafish larvae using the transgenic line Tg(elav3:GCaMP6s). In particular, we use the chemical agent allyl isothiocyanate to induce a robust, reproducible fluorescent response in a brain region at the border of the hindbrain and spinal cord. We discuss the potential uses of GCaMP6s for optical monitoring of neural activity during a range of behavioral paradigms and the limitations of this technique. Our protocol outlines an accessible approach for monitoring dynamic, behavior-related in vivo neural activity in the larval zebrafish brain.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how cells respond to mechanical signals is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms involved in tissue development and disease progression. However, existing in vitro cell culture substrates often fail to replicate the physiological stiffness gradients at the cellular scale while also eliminating confounding topographical cues. In this study, we present a decoupled stiffness model utilizing a bilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. This substrate consists of a soft, flat top film suspended over a rigid underlayer featuring ridge-and-groove microstructures. The top layer effectively transmits stiffness variations in the underlying structure while maintaining uniform topography and chemistry at the cell contact surface. Stiffness modulation is achieved by varying the width of the alternating ridges and grooves, which are spaced equally. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the flat surface morphology and consistent contact topography. Atomic force microscopy demonstrated that stiffness variations were dependent on the microstructure: for 20 μm patterns, the elastic moduli were approximately 950 kPa for ridges and 850 kPa for grooves; for 50 μm patterns, these values were around 1070 kPa and 950 kPa, respectively. Mouse primary bone marrow cells adhered well and spread on the substrate, showing a preference for nuclear localization toward the stiffer ridge regions in the 50 µm pattern (61.49%, p < 0.05), thereby confirming effective cellular perception of the mechanical gradient. In summary, this protocol offers a reproducible method to construct a cell culture substrate with microscale stiffness gradients, minimizing the chemical or topography interference, enabling investigations into cell mechanotransduction.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic nature of retinal cellular processes necessitates advancements in gene delivery and live monitoring techniques to enhance the understanding and treatment of ocular diseases. This study introduces an optimized adeno-associated virus (AAV) approach, utilizing specific serotypes and promoters to achieve optimal transfection efficiency in targeted retinal cells, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and Müller glia. Leveraging the precision of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO), this work presents a non-invasive method for in vivo imaging that captures the longitudinal expression of AAV-mediated green fluorescent protein (GFP). This approach eliminates the need for terminal procedures, preserving the continuity of observation and the well-being of the subject. Furthermore, the GFP signal can be traced in AAV-infected RGCs along the visual pathway to the superior colliculus (SC) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), enabling the potential for direct visual pathway mapping. These findings provide a detailed protocol and demonstrate the application of this powerful tool for real-time studies of retinal cell behavior, disease pathogenesis, and the efficacy of gene therapy interventions, offering valuable insights into the living retina and its connections.",

    "abstract": "Vascular organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) recapitulate the cell type diversity and complex architecture of human vascular networks. This three-dimensional (3D) model holds substantial potential for vascular pathology modeling and in vitro drug screening. Despite recent advances, a key technical challenge remains in reproducibly generating organoids with consistent quality, which is crucial for downstream assays and applications. Here, a modified protocol is presented that improves both the homogeneity and reproducibility of vascular organoid generation. The modified protocol incorporates the use of microwells and the CEPT cocktail (chroman 1, emricasan, polyamines, and the integrated stress response inhibitor, trans-ISRIB) to improve embryoid body formation and cell survival. Differentiated, mature vascular organoids generated using this protocol are characterized by whole-mount 3D immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze their morphology and complex vasculature. This protocol enables the production of high-quality vascular organoids in a scalable manner, potentially facilitating their use in disease modeling and drug screening applications.",

    "title": "Generating and Co-culturing Murine Primary Microglia and Cortical Neurons.",
    "abstract": "Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), performing numerous functions that support neuronal health and CNS homeostasis. They are a major population of immune cells associated with CNS disease activity, adopting reactive phenotypes that potentially contribute to neuronal injury during chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The distinct mechanisms by which microglia regulate neuronal function and survival during health and disease remain limited due to challenges in resolving the complex in vivo interactions between microglia, neurons, and other CNS environmental factors. Thus, the in vitro approach of co-culturing microglia and neurons remains a valuable tool for studying microglia-neuronal interactions. Here, we present a protocol to generate and co-culture primary microglia and neurons from mice. Specifically, microglia were isolated after 9-10 days in vitro from a mixed glia culture established from brain homogenates derived from neonatal mice between post-natal days 0-2. Neuronal cells were isolated from brain cortices of mouse embryos between embryonic days 16-18. After 4-5 days in vitro, neuronal cells were seeded in 96-well plates, followed by the addition of microglia to form the co-culture. Careful timing is critical for this protocol as both cell types need to reach experimental maturity to establish the co-culture. Overall, this co-culture can be useful for studying microglia-neuron interactions and can provide multiple readouts, including immunofluorescence microscopy, live imaging, as well as RNA and protein assays.",

    "title": "Analysis of the Mitochondrial Density and Longitudinal Distribution in Rat Live-Skeletal Muscle Fibers by Confocal Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "The mitochondrion is an organelle that can be elongated, fragmented, and renovated according to the metabolic requirements of the cells. The remodeling of the mitochondrial network allows healthy mitochondria to meet cellular demands; however, the loss of this capacity has been related to the development or progression of different pathologies. In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial density and distribution changes are observed in physiological and pathological conditions such as exercise, aging, and obesity, among others. Therefore, the study of the mitochondrial network may provide a better understanding of mechanisms related to those conditions. Here, a protocol for mitochondria imaging of live-skeletal muscle fibers from rats is described. Fibers are manually dissected in a relaxing solution and incubated with a fluorescent live-cell imaging indicator of mitochondria (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester, TMRE). The mitochondria signal is recorded by confocal microscopy using the XYZ scan mode to obtain confocal images of the intermyofibrillar mitochondrial (IMF) network. After that, the confocal images are processed by thresholding and binarization. The binarized confocal image accounts for the positive pixels for mitochondria, which are then counted to obtain the mitochondrial density. The mitochondrial network in skeletal muscle is characterized by a high density of IMF population, which has a periodic longitudinal distribution similar to that of T-tubules (TT). The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a standard analysis technique performed to evaluate the distribution of TT that allows finding the distribution frequency and the level of their organization. In this protocol, the implementation of the FFT algorithm is described for the analysis of the longitudinal mitochondrial distribution in skeletal muscle.",

    "title": "DetectSyn: A Rapid, Unbiased Fluorescent Method to Detect Changes in Synapse Density.",
    "abstract": "Synapses are the site of communication between neurons. Neuronal circuit strength is related to synaptic density, and the breakdown of synapses is characteristic of disease states like major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease. Traditional techniques to investigate synapse numbers include genetic expression of fluorescent markers (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP)), dyes that fill a neuron (e.g., carbocyanine dye, DiI), and immunofluorescent detection of spine markers (e.g., postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95)). A major caveat to these proxy techniques is that they only identify postsynaptic changes. Yet, a synapse is a connection between a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic spine. The gold standard for measuring synapse formation/elimination requires time-consuming electron microscopy or array tomography techniques. These techniques require specialized training and costly equipment. Further, only a limited number of neurons can be assessed and are used to represent changes to an entire brain region. DetectSyn is a rapid fluorescent technique that identifies changes to synapse formation or elimination due to a disease state or drug activity. DetectSyn utilizes a rapid proximity ligation assay to detect juxtaposed pre- and postsynaptic proteins and standard fluorescent microscopy, a technique readily available to most laboratories. Fluorescent detection of the resulting puncta allows for quick and unbiased analysis of experiments. DetectSyn provides more representative results than electron microscopy because larger areas can be analyzed than a limited number of fluorescent neurons. Moreover, DetectSyn works for in vitro cultured neurons and fixed tissue slices. Finally, a method is provided to analyze the data collected from this technique. Overall, DetectSyn offers a procedure for detecting relative changes in synapse density across treatments or disease states and is more accessible than traditional techniques.",

    "title": "Generation of Cancer Cell Clones to Visualize Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA TERRA Expressed from a Single Telomere in Living Cells.",
    "abstract": "Telomeres are transcribed, giving rise to telomeric repeat-containing long noncoding RNAs (TERRA), which have been proposed to play important roles in telomere biology, including heterochromatin formation and telomere length homeostasis. Recent findings revealed that TERRA molecules also interact with internal chromosomal regions to regulate gene expression in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In line with this evidence, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) analyses have shown that only a subset of TERRA transcripts localize at chromosome ends. A better understanding of the dynamics of TERRA molecules will help define their function and mechanisms of action. Here, we describe a method to label and visualize single-telomere TERRA transcripts in cancer cells using the MS2-GFP system. To this aim, we present a protocol to generate stable clones, using the AGS human stomach cancer cell line, containing MS2 sequences integrated at a single subtelomere. Transcription of TERRA from the MS2-tagged telomere results in the expression of MS2-tagged TERRA molecules that are visualized by live-cell fluorescence microscopy upon co-expression of a MS2 RNA-binding protein fused to GFP (MS2-GFP). This approach enables researchers to study the dynamics of single-telomere TERRA molecules in cancer cells, and it can be applied to other cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Here, we describe the generation of floating cultures of apical-out intestinal organoids from hydrogel-embedded intestinal organoid cultures. Concurrently, floating basal-out organoid cultures are established for direct comparison between apical-out and basal-out organoids. Apical-out and basal-out organoids are subsequently subjected to the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), which is integrated into the newly synthesized DNA during the S-phase of cell division. This incorporation into DNA can be visualized in morphologically intact organoids using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cells labeled with Hoechst33342 and EdU are then quantified in a semiautomatic manner using image analysis software. Calculation of the percentage of EdU-positive cells of the total number of cells allows for the analysis of cell proliferation in three-dimensional (3D) organoids. Despite being used here for the analysis of proliferation in intestinal organoids, the protocol is applicable to the analysis of nucleus-specific stainings of various sorts in other organoids or two-dimensional cell cultures as well.",

    "title": "Whole-mount Retinal Organoid Visualization with Cellular Resolution.",
    "abstract": "Retinal organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells are intricate 3D structures that mimic the human retina, offering a powerful platform for studying retinal development, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic strategies. Moreover, as they are derived from patients, they are becoming increasingly popular as they hold great promise as a tool for personalized medicine. Unlike conventional 2D cell cultures, retinal organoids preserve the native 3D architecture of the retina, allowing for a more realistic representation and enabling more physiologically relevant studies. However, their structural complexity, high cellular density, and diverse composition present significant challenges for characterization. To address these challenges and enhance our understanding of retinal organoid maturation while preserving the 3D context, we combined optical clearing methods with immunolabeling to visualize the entire structure of whole-mount organoids with confocal microscopy. For this, we employed a clearing method compatible with low- and high-numerical-aperture objectives, facilitating full-volume imaging and capturing certain regions of interest with cellular resolution. Using this approach, we identified the morphology and distribution in 3D of the three main neuron paths responsible for the visual information transmission: cone and rod photoreceptors, bipolar and ganglion cells. Our findings shed more light on the visualization techniques to address the spatial organization of retinal cells within the organoid.",

    "title": "High-Throughput Capable Three-Dimensional Tissue Model for Quantification of Electroporation Thresholds.",
    "abstract": "Electroporation is a promising technology utilizing electrical pulses for macromolecule delivery and soft-tissue ablation, with applications that include next-generation prophylactics and the treatment of genetic diseases such as cancer. This study demonstrates a high-throughput capable 3D tissue culture model for quantification of the reversible and irreversible electroporation thresholds for a given electroporation protocol. By using a non-uniform electric field and analyzing the spatial distribution of transfected cells, both reversible and irreversible thresholds can be identified within a single sample, increasing the efficiency at which electroporation protocols can be characterized, especially for in vivo translation. To show this capability, 3D tissue mimics containing HEK293 cells were transfected using a ring and pin electrode to deliver a GFP-encoding plasmid. Electroporation thresholds were then derived based on fluorescent microscopy images of the transfected samples. This model demonstrates potential for use as a means for high-throughput evaluation of electroporation protocols, a key advantage over current methods to evaluate these thresholds, which tend to be time-intensive and are less representative of in vivo conditions.",

    "abstract": "This protocol outlines a procedure for knocking out the RIP1 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 in the human monocyte U937 cell line. The method utilizes designated guide RNA plasmids and lentiviral packaging plasmids to achieve RIP1 gene knockout. The protocol addresses challenges and improvements to traditional CRISPR methods, enabling its replication for future cell death studies. The resulting mutant cells can be used to investigate mechanistic changes in cell death, where functional RIP1 proteins would otherwise play a role. Viability assays demonstrated a significant reduction in cell death in knockout cells following necroptosis induction. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a marked decrease in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in knockout cells under the same conditions. Together, these functional assays confirm the loss of RIP1 protein. Optimized for use with U937 human monocytes, this procedure may also be adapted to target other key cell death regulators, yielding functional, non-lethal mutants. Potential pitfalls are addressed throughout to provide insights into challenges that may arise during mutant generation.",

    "title": "Preparing Retinal Organoid Samples for Transmission Electron Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Retinal organoids (ROs) are a three-dimensional culture system mimicking human retinal features that have differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) under specific conditions. Synapse development and maturation in ROs have been studied immunocytochemically and functionally. However, the direct evidence of the synaptic contact ultrastructure is limited, containing both special ribbon synapses and conventional chemical synapses. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is characterized by high resolution and a respectable history elucidating retinal development and synapse maturation in humans and various species. It is a powerful tool to explore synaptic structure in ROs and is widely used in the research field of ROs. Therefore, to better explore the structure of RO synaptic contacts at the nanoscale and obtain high-quality microscopic evidence, we developed a simple and repeatable method of RO TEM sample preparation. This paper describes the protocol, reagents used, and detailed steps, including RO fixation preparation, post fixation, embedding, and visualization.",

    "title": "Quantification of Cytokine-Induced Cell Death in Human Colonic Organoids Using Live Fluorescence Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death is increased in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This can contribute to defects in intestinal barrier function, exacerbation of inflammation, and disease immunopathogenesis. Cytokines and death receptor ligands are partially responsible for this increase in IEC death. IBD-relevant cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, are cytotoxic to IECs both independently and in combination. This protocol describes a simple and practical assay to quantify cytokine-induced cytotoxicity in CD patient-derived colonic organoids using a fluorescent cell death dye (SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain), live fluorescence microscopy, and open-source image analysis software. We also demonstrate how to use the Bliss independence mathematical model to calculate a coefficient of perturbagen interaction (CPI) based on organoid cytotoxicity. The CPI can be used to determine if interactions between cytokine combinations or other types of perturbagens are antagonistic, additive, or synergistic. This protocol can be implemented to investigate the cytotoxic activity of cytokines and other perturbagens using patient-derived colonic organoids.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical gene therapy research, particularly in rodent and large animal models, necessitates the production of AAV vectors with high yield and purity. Traditional approaches in research laboratories often involve extensive use of cell culture dishes to cultivate HEK293T cells, a process that can be both laborious and problematic. Here, a unique in-house method is presented, which simplifies this process with a specific cell factory (or cell stacks, CF10) platform. An integration of polyethylene glycol/aqueous two-phase partitioning with iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation improves both the yield and purity of the generated AAV vectors. The purity of the AAV vectors is verified through SDS-PAGE and silver staining, while the ratio of full to empty particles is determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This approach offers an efficient cell factory platform for the production of AAV vectors at high yields, coupled with an improved purification method to meet the quality demands for in vivo studies.",

    "title": "Alternative Strategy to Analyze In Vitro Cell Invasion of 3D Cultures.",
    "abstract": "Spheroid culture is a 3D model that provides an improved replication of the in vivo microenvironment compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures. Invasion is a cellular outcome of utmost interest in cancer biology. In this protocol, we have devised an alternative strategy for evaluating cancer cell invasion in vitro, employing heterospheroids comprised of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), and monocytes. These heterospheroids aim to mimic the tumor microenvironment (TME), including two relevant non-neoplastic cell types alongside the cancer cells. Each cell type was labeled with vital fluorescent markers emitting in distinct wavelengths before spheroid formation. Once formed, heterospheroids were seeded onto a layer of human leiomyoma-derived extracellular matrix in the upper compartment of a microporous membrane. Invasion was assessed in the z-axis using confocal microscopy. Digital images were obtained in the corresponding fluorescent channels at 10 µm intervals, covering a depth of 90 µm in the z-axis. Analysis was performed using freeware image software by calculating the integrated fluorescence intensity in each image and fluorescence channel. This approach enables a more dynamic analysis of cell invasion patterns in a multilayered context, as well as the examination of spatial co-localization of different cell types during invasion.",

    "title": "Visualization of Inflammatory Caspases Induced Proximity in Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages.",
    "abstract": "Inflammatory caspases include caspase-1, -4, -5, -11, and -12 and belong to the subgroup of initiator caspases. Caspase-1 is required to ensure correct regulation of inflammatory signaling and is activated by proximity-induced dimerization following recruitment to inflammasomes. Caspase-1 is abundant in the monocytic cell lineage and induces maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 to active secreted molecules. The other inflammatory caspases, caspase-4 and -5 (and their murine homolog caspase-11) promote IL-1β release by inducing pyroptosis. Caspase Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) is a tool used to measure inflammatory caspase induced proximity as a readout of caspase activation. The caspase-1, -4, or -5 prodomain, which contains the region that binds to the inflammasome, is fused to non-fluorescent fragments of the yellow fluorescent protein Venus (Venus-N [VN] or Venus-C [VC]) that associate to reform the fluorescent Venus complex when the caspases undergo induced proximity. This protocol describes how to introduce these reporters into primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) using nucleofection, treat the cells to induce inflammatory caspase activation, and measure caspase activation using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The advantage of this approach is that it can be used to identify the components, requirements, and localization of the inflammatory caspase activation complex in living cells. However, careful controls need to be considered to avoid compromising cell viability and behavior. This technique is a powerful tool for the analysis of dynamic caspase interactions at the inflammasome level as well as for the interrogation of the inflammatory signaling cascades in living MDM and monocytes derived from human blood samples.",

    "title": "Imaging Replicative Domains in Ultrastructurally Preserved Chromatin by Electron Tomography.",
    "abstract": "Principles of DNA folding in the cell nucleus and its dynamic transformations that occur during the fulfillment of basic genetic functions (transcription, replication, segregation, etc.) remain poorly understood, partially due to the lack of experimental approaches to high-resolution visualization of specific chromatin loci in structurally preserved nuclei. Here we present a protocol for the visualization of replicative domains in monolayer cell culture in situ, by combining EdU labeling of newly synthesized DNA with subsequent label detection with Ag-amplification of Nanogold particles and ChromEM staining of chromatin. This protocol allows for the high-contrast, high-efficiency pre-embedding labeling, compatible with traditional glutaraldehyde fixation that provides the best structural preservation of chromatin for room-temperature sample processing. Another advantage of pre-embedding labeling is the possibility to pre-select cells of interest for sectioning. This is especially important for the analysis of heterogeneous cell populations, as well as compatibility with electron tomography approaches to high-resolution 3D analysis of chromatin organization at sites of replication, and the analysis of post-replicative chromatin rearrangement and sister chromatid segregation in the interphase.",

    "title": "Live Imaging of the Mitochondrial Glutathione Redox State in Primary Neurons using a Ratiometric Indicator.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial redox homeostasis is important for neuronal viability and function. Although mitochondria contain several redox systems, the highly abundant thiol-disulfide redox buffer glutathione is considered a central player in antioxidant defenses. Therefore, measuring the mitochondrial glutathione redox potential provides useful information about mitochondrial redox status and oxidative stress. Glutaredoxin1-roGFP2 (Grx1-roGFP2) is a genetically encoded, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based ratiometric indicator of the glutathione redox potential that has two redox-state-sensitive excitation peaks at 400 nm and 490 nm with a single emission peak at 510 nm. This article describes how to perform confocal live microscopy of mitochondria-targeted Grx1-roGFP2 in primary hippocampal and cortical neurons. It describes how to assess steady-state mitochondrial glutathione redox potential (e.g., to compare disease states or long-term treatments) and how to measure redox changes upon acute treatments (using the excitotoxic drug N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) as an example). In addition, the article presents co-imaging of Grx1-roGFP2 and the mitochondrial membrane potential indicator, tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE), to demonstrate how Grx1-roGPF2 can be multiplexed with additional indicators for multiparametric analyses. This protocol provides a detailed description of how to (i) optimize confocal laser scanning microscope settings, (ii) apply drugs for stimulation followed by sensor calibration with diamide and dithiothreitol, and (iii) analyze data with ImageJ/FIJI.",

    "title": "Opsono-Adherence Assay to Evaluate Functional Antibodies in Vaccine Development Against Bacillus anthracis and Other Encapsulated Pathogens.",
    "abstract": "The opsono-adherence assay is a functional assay that enumerates the attachment of bacterial pathogens to professional phagocytes. Because adherence is requisite to phagocytosis and killing, the assay is an alternative method to opsono-phagocytic killing assays. An advantage of the opsono-adherence assay is the option of using inactivated pathogens and mammalian cell lines, which allows standardization across multiple experiments. The use of an inactivated pathogen in the assay also facilitates work with biosafety level 3 infectious agents and other virulent pathogens. In our work, the opsono-adherence assay was used to assess the functional ability of antibodies, from sera of animals immunized with an anthrax capsule-based vaccine, to induce adherence of fixed Bacillus anthracis to a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Automated fluorescence microscopy was used to capture images of bacilli adhering to macrophages. Increased adherence was correlated with the presence of anti-capsule antibodies in the serum. Non-human primates that exhibited high serum anti-capsule antibody concentrations were protected from anthrax challenge. Thus, the opsono-adherence assay can be used to elucidate the biological functions of antigen specific antibodies in sera, to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates and other therapeutics, and to serve as a possible correlate of immunity.",

    "title": "An Innovative 3D-Printed Insert Designed to Enable Straightforward 2D and 3D Cell Cultures.",
    "abstract": "The classical analyses of indirect communication between different cell types necessitate the use of conditioned media. Moreover, the production of conditioned media remains time-consuming and far from physiological and pathological conditions. Although a few models of co-culture are commercially available, they remain restricted to specific assays and are mostly for two types of cells. Here, 3D-printed inserts are used that are compatible with numerous functional assays. The insert allows the separation of one well of a 6-well plate into four compartments. A wide range of combinations can be set. Moreover, windows are designed in each wall of the compartments so that potential intercellular communication between every compartment is possible in the culture medium in a volume-dependent manner. For example, paracrine intercellular communication can be studied between four cell types in monolayer, in 3D (spheroids), or by combining both. In addition, a mix of different cell types can be seeded in the same compartment in 2D or 3D (organoids) format. The absence of a bottom in the 3D-printed inserts allows the usual culture conditions on the plate, possible coating on the plate containing the insert, and direct visualization by optical microscopy. The multiple compartments provide the possibility to collect different cell types independently or to use, in each compartment, different reagents for RNA or protein extraction. In this study, a detailed methodology is provided to use the new 3D-printed insert as a co-culture system. To demonstrate several capacities of this flexible and simple model, previously published functional assays of cell communication were performed in the new 3D-printed inserts and were demonstrated to be reproducible. The 3D-printed inserts and the conventional cell culture using conditioned media led to similar results. In conclusion, the 3D-printed insert is a simple device that can be adapted to numerous models of co-cultures with adherent cell types.",
