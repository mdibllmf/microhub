# The pipeline uses these APIs across multiple stages:
#
# ENRICHMENT (3_clean.py --enrich / default API enrichment):
#   - GitHub:           Repository stats, health scores, activity
#   - Semantic Scholar: Citation counts, fields of study (batch endpoint)
#   - CrossRef:         Data repository discovery (no key needed)
#
# VALIDATION (automatic in orchestrator):
#   - FPbase:       Fluorescent protein validation (no key needed)
#   - SciCrunch:    RRID validation (no key needed)
#   - ROR API:      Organization validation (no key needed)
#   - NCBI Taxonomy: Organism validation (no key needed)
#   - PubTator 3.0: Supplemental NER for papers with PMIDs (no key needed)

# GitHub Personal Access Token (https://github.com/settings/tokens)
# Without token: 60 API calls/hour.  With token: 5,000/hour.
# No special scopes needed — public repo access only.

# Semantic Scholar API Key (https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key)
# Without key: ~1 request/sec, heavily rate-limited.
# With key: ~10 requests/sec, batch endpoint works reliably.
