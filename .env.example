# The cleanup step (3_clean.py) uses these APIs to enrich paper metadata:
#   - GitHub: repository stats, health scores, activity
#   - Semantic Scholar: citation counts, fields of study
#   - CrossRef: additional data repositories (no key needed)

# GitHub Personal Access Token (https://github.com/settings/tokens)
# Without token: 60 API calls/hour.  With token: 5,000/hour.

# Semantic Scholar API Key (https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key)
# Without key: ~1 request/sec, heavily rate-limited.
# With key: ~10 requests/sec, batch endpoint works reliably.
