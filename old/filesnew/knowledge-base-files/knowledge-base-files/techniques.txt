Microscopy Techniques Knowledge Base

CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY
Keywords: confocal, CLSM, laser scanning, pinhole, optical sectioning, z-stack
Confocal laser scanning microscopy uses a pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light, enabling optical sectioning. Common applications include immunofluorescence imaging, 3D reconstruction, and colocalization studies.

LIGHT SHEET MICROSCOPY
Keywords: light sheet, SPIM, selective plane illumination, LSFM, diSPIM, lattice light sheet, mesoSPIM
Light sheet fluorescence microscopy illuminates samples from the side with a thin sheet of light. Ideal for live imaging of embryos, organoids, and cleared tissues with minimal phototoxicity.

TWO-PHOTON MICROSCOPY
Keywords: two-photon, 2P, multiphoton, MPM, deep tissue, intravital
Two-photon excitation microscopy uses near-infrared lasers for deep tissue imaging with reduced scattering. Essential for in vivo brain imaging and intravital microscopy.

SUPER-RESOLUTION MICROSCOPY
Keywords: super-resolution, nanoscopy, STED, PALM, STORM, SIM, SMLM, dSTORM, MINFLUX
Super-resolution techniques break the diffraction limit. STED uses depletion lasers, PALM/STORM use photoswitchable fluorophores, and SIM uses structured illumination patterns.

ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Keywords: electron microscopy, EM, TEM, SEM, cryo-EM, FIB-SEM, serial section, CLEM
Electron microscopy provides nanometer-scale resolution. TEM for transmission imaging, SEM for surface topology, cryo-EM for native structure preservation.

EXPANSION MICROSCOPY
Keywords: expansion microscopy, ExM, hydrogel, physical magnification, isotropic expansion
Expansion microscopy physically enlarges samples by embedding in swellable hydrogels, enabling super-resolution imaging on conventional microscopes.

TIRF MICROSCOPY
Keywords: TIRF, total internal reflection, evanescent wave, single molecule, membrane imaging
Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy creates an evanescent wave for selective excitation near the coverslip, ideal for membrane dynamics and single molecule studies.

FRET IMAGING
Keywords: FRET, Förster resonance energy transfer, protein interaction, biosensor, acceptor photobleaching
FRET measures molecular proximity through energy transfer between fluorophores, used for studying protein-protein interactions and conformational changes.

FLIM IMAGING
Keywords: FLIM, fluorescence lifetime, time-correlated, TCSPC, phasor analysis
Fluorescence lifetime imaging measures the decay rate of fluorescence, providing information about the molecular environment independent of concentration.

MULTIPLEX IMAGING
Keywords: multiplex, cyclic immunofluorescence, CyCIF, CODEX, imaging mass cytometry, spatial proteomics
Multiplex imaging techniques detect many markers simultaneously or sequentially, enabling spatial proteomics and cell phenotyping in tissues.
