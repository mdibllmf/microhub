Model Organisms Knowledge Base

ZEBRAFISH
Keywords: zebrafish, Danio rerio, zebrafish embryo, larvae, transparent, regeneration, developmental
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are popular for developmental biology and live imaging due to optical transparency of embryos. Rapid development, genetic tractability, and regeneration capacity.

MOUSE
Keywords: mouse, Mus musculus, murine, rodent, transgenic, knockout, in vivo
Mouse (Mus musculus) is the primary mammalian model organism. Extensive genetic tools including transgenics and knockouts. Used for disease modeling and intravital imaging.

DROSOPHILA
Keywords: Drosophila, fruit fly, melanogaster, genetics, development, neuroscience
Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) offers powerful genetics and rapid generation time. Key model for developmental biology and neuroscience.

C. ELEGANS
Keywords: C. elegans, nematode, worm, Caenorhabditis, connectome, transparent
Caenorhabditis elegans is a transparent nematode with defined cell lineage and mapped neural connectome. Ideal for developmental and neurobiological studies.

XENOPUS
Keywords: Xenopus, frog, laevis, tropicalis, oocyte, embryo, development
Xenopus laevis and tropicalis frogs provide large embryos for developmental studies. Oocytes used for protein expression.

ARABIDOPSIS
Keywords: Arabidopsis, thaliana, plant, plant cell, chloroplast, cell wall
Arabidopsis thaliana is the primary plant model organism. Small genome, rapid life cycle, extensive genetic resources.

YEAST
Keywords: yeast, Saccharomyces, cerevisiae, S. pombe, cell cycle, single cell
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) and S. pombe (fission yeast) are unicellular eukaryotic models for cell biology and genetics.

RAT
Keywords: rat, Rattus norvegicus, rodent, neuroscience, physiology
Rat (Rattus norvegicus) used for physiology and neuroscience. Larger than mouse, suitable for surgical procedures and behavior.

CHICKEN
Keywords: chicken, chick embryo, Gallus, neural crest, development
Chicken embryos are accessible for developmental biology. Neural crest and somite development studies.

HUMAN CELLS
Keywords: human, HeLa, HEK293, iPSC, organoid, patient-derived
Human cell lines (HeLa, HEK293) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for human biology. Organoids model tissue organization.

PRIMARY CELLS
Keywords: primary cells, freshly isolated, culture, fibroblast, neuron, cardiomyocyte
Primary cells isolated directly from tissue. More physiologically relevant than immortalized lines but limited lifespan.

SPHEROIDS
Keywords: spheroid, 3D culture, tumor spheroid, aggregate, multicellular
Spheroids are 3D cell aggregates that better recapitulate tissue architecture than 2D cultures.

ORGANOIDS
Keywords: organoid, mini-organ, intestinal, brain, lung, stem cell derived
Organoids are self-organizing 3D structures derived from stem cells that model organ development and disease.

TISSUE SECTIONS
Keywords: tissue section, histology, frozen section, FFPE, paraffin, cryosection
Tissue sections prepared by freezing (cryosections) or paraffin embedding (FFPE) for histological analysis.

CLEARED TISSUE
Keywords: cleared tissue, tissue clearing, CLARITY, iDISCO, CUBIC, transparent
Chemically cleared tissues rendered optically transparent for whole-mount imaging with light sheet microscopy.
