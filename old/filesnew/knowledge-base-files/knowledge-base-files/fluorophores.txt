GFP AND VARIANTS
Keywords: GFP, EGFP, mCherry, mNeonGreen, mScarlet, fluorescent protein, FP, genetically encoded
Green fluorescent protein and derivatives enable genetic tagging. EGFP (green), mCherry/mScarlet (red), mNeonGreen (bright green). Genetically encoded for live imaging.

DAPI
Keywords: DAPI, nuclei, DNA, blue, counterstain, fixed cells
DAPI binds DNA minor groove and emits blue fluorescence. Standard nuclear counterstain for fixed cells. Not membrane permeable in live cells.

HOECHST
Keywords: Hoechst, 33342, 33258, nuclei, DNA, live cell, blue
Hoechst dyes are cell-permeable DNA stains for nuclear visualization in live and fixed cells. Less phototoxic than DAPI for live imaging.

DRAQ5
Keywords: DRAQ5, far-red, DNA, nuclei, live cell, deep red
DRAQ5 is a far-red DNA dye compatible with live cells. Useful when green/red channels are occupied.

MITOTRACKER
Keywords: MitoTracker, mitochondria, CMXRos, Green, Deep Red, live cell
MitoTracker dyes label mitochondria in live cells. Various colors available. CMXRos retained after fixation.

LYSOTRACKER
Keywords: LysoTracker, lysosomes, acidic, Green, Red, live cell
LysoTracker dyes accumulate in acidic organelles (lysosomes) for live cell imaging.

PHALLOIDIN
Keywords: phalloidin, actin, F-actin, cytoskeleton, fixed cells, rhodamine
Phalloidin conjugates bind F-actin filaments. Available with various fluorophores. Requires permeabilization (fixed cells only).

SIRNA PROBES
Keywords: SiR, silicon rhodamine, SiR-actin, SiR-tubulin, live cell, far-red
Silicon rhodamine probes are cell-permeable, far-red dyes for live cell imaging of actin, tubulin, and DNA.

CALCEIN
Keywords: calcein, viability, live/dead, AM ester, green
Calcein-AM is cleaved by esterases in live cells to produce green fluorescence. Used in viability assays.

PROPIDIUM IODIDE
Keywords: propidium iodide, PI, dead cells, DNA, membrane impermeable
Propidium iodide enters membrane-compromised cells and binds DNA. Marker of cell death.

QUANTUM DOTS
Keywords: quantum dot, Qdot, semiconductor, photostable, single molecule
Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals with exceptional brightness and photostability. Used for single molecule tracking.

FITC
Keywords: FITC, fluorescein, green, isothiocyanate, traditional
Fluorescein isothiocyanate is a traditional green dye. Less photostable than modern alternatives but still widely used.

RHODAMINE
Keywords: rhodamine, TRITC, red, tetramethyl, traditional
Rhodamine dyes emit red fluorescence. TRITC commonly used for immunofluorescence. Being replaced by brighter alternatives.

JANELIA FLUOR
Keywords: JF, Janelia Fluor, HaloTag, SNAP-tag, live cell, photostable
Janelia Fluor dyes developed at HHMI Janelia. Excellent for live cell imaging with HaloTag and SNAP-tag systems.

CALCIUM INDICATORS
Keywords: calcium, Fura-2, GCaMP, Fluo-4, indicator, functional imaging
Calcium indicators report intracellular calcium changes. Chemical dyes (Fura-2, Fluo-4) and genetically encoded (GCaMP series).

VOLTAGE INDICATORS
Keywords: voltage, ASAP, ArcLight, membrane potential, GEVI
Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) report membrane potential changes. ASAP and ArcLight families.
