ABSTRACT:
Saliva is essential for oral health. The molecular mechanisms leading to physiological fluid secretion are largely established, but factors that underlie secretory hypofunction, specifically related to the autoimmune disease Sjögren's syndrome (SS) are not fully understood. A major conundrum is the lack of association between the severity of inflammatory immune cell infiltration within the salivary glands and glandular hypofunction. In this study, we investigated in a mouse model system, mechanisms of glandular hypofunction caused by the activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Glandular hypofunction and SS-like disease were induced by treatment with 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), a small molecule agonist of murine STING. Contrary to our expectations, despite a significant reduction in fluid secretion in DMXAA-treated mice, in vivo imaging demonstrated that neural stimulation resulted in greatly enhanced spatially averaged cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Notably, however, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca2+ signals were altered to signals that propagated throughout the entire cytoplasm as opposed to largely apically confined Ca2+ rises observed without treatment. Despite the augmented Ca2+ signals, muscarinic stimulation resulted in reduced activation of TMEM16a, although there were no changes in channel abundance or absolute sensitivity to Ca2+. However, super-resolution microscopy revealed a disruption in the intimate colocalization of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca2+ release channels in relation to TMEM16a. TMEM16a channel activation was also reduced when intracellular Ca2+ buffering was increased. These data are consistent with altered local coupling between the channels contributing to the reduced activation of TMEM16a. Appropriate Ca2+ signaling is also pivotal for mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics and secretion is an energetically expensive process. Disrupted mitochondrial morphology, a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced oxygen consumption rate were observed in DMXAA-treated animals compared to control animals. We report that early in SS disease, dysregulated Ca2+ signals lead to decreased fluid secretion and disrupted mitochondrial function contributing to salivary gland hypofunction and likely the progression of SS disease.

ABSTRACT:
Vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG), a second-order nonlinear optical signal, has traditionally been used to study molecules at interfaces as a spectroscopy technique with a spatial resolution of ~100 µm. However, the spectroscopy is not sensitive to the heterogeneity of a sample. To study mesoscopically heterogeneous samples, we, along with others, pushed the resolution limit of VSFG spectroscopy down to ~1 µm level and constructed the VSFG microscope. This imaging technique not only can resolve sample morphologies through imaging, but also record a broadband VSFG spectrum at every pixel of the images. Being a second-order nonlinear optical technique, its selection rule enables the visualization of non-centrosymmetric or chiral self-assembled structures commonly found in biology, materials science, and bioengineering, among others. In this article, the audience will be guided through an inverted transmission design that allows for imaging unfixed samples. This work also showcases that VSFG microscopy can resolve chemical-specific geometric information of individual self-assembled sheets by combining it with a neural network function solver. Lastly, the images obtained under brightfield, SHG, and VSFG configurations of various samples briefly discuss the unique information revealed by VSFG imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a debilitating retinal disorder in aging populations. It is widely believed that dysfunction of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is a key pathobiological event in AMD. To understand the mechanisms that lead to RPE dysfunction, mouse models can be utilized by researchers. It has been established by previous studies that mice can develop RPE pathologies, some of which are observed in the eyes of individuals diagnosed with AMD. Here, we describe a phenotyping protocol to assess RPE pathologies in mice. This protocol includes the preparation and evaluation of retinal cross-sections using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, as well as that of RPE flat mounts by confocal microscopy. We detail the common types of murine RPE pathologies observed by these techniques and ways to quantify them through unbiased methods for statistical testing. As proof of concept, we use this RPE phenotyping protocol to quantify the RPE pathologies observed in mice overexpressing transmembrane protein 135 (Tmem135) and aged wild-type C57BL/6J mice. The main goal of this protocol is to present standard RPE phenotyping methods with unbiased quantitative assessments for scientists using mouse models of AMD.

ABSTRACT:
The pancreatic islets of Langerhans, which are small 3D collections of specialized endocrine and supporting cells interspersed throughout the pancreas, have a central role in the control of glucose homeostasis through the secretion of insulin by beta cells, which lowers blood glucose, and glucagon by alpha cells, which raises blood glucose. Intracellular signaling pathways, including those mediated by cAMP, are key for regulated alpha and beta cell hormone secretion. The 3D islet structure, while essential for coordinated islet function, presents experimental challenges for mechanistic studies of the intracellular signaling pathways in primary human islet cells. To overcome these challenges and limitations, this protocol describes an integrated live-cell imaging and microfluidic platform using primary human pseudoislets generated from donors without diabetes that resemble native islets in their morphology, composition, and function. These pseudoislets are size-controlled through the dispersion and reaggregation process of primary human islet cells. In the dispersed state, islet cell gene expression can be manipulated; for example, biosensors such as the genetically encoded cAMP biosensor, cADDis, can be introduced. Once formed, pseudoislets expressing a genetically encoded biosensor, in combination with confocal microscopy and a microperifusion platform, allow for the synchronous assessment of fluorescent biosensor dynamics and alpha and beta cell hormone secretory profiles to provide more insight into cellular processes and function.

ABSTRACT:
Detecting cell viability is crucial in research involving the precancerous discovery of abnormal cells, the evaluation of treatments, and drug toxicity testing. Although conventional methods afford cumulative results regarding cell viability based on a great number of cells, they do not permit investigating cell viability at the single-cell level. In response, we rationally designed and synthesized a fluorescent probe, PCV-1, to visualize cell viability under the super-resolution technology of structured illumination microscopy. Given its sensitivity to mitochondrial membrane potential and affinity to DNA, PCV-1's ability to stain mitochondria and nucleoli was observed in live and dead cells, respectively. During cell injury induced by drug treatment, PCV-1's migration from mitochondria to the nucleolus was dynamically visualized at the single-cell level. By extension, harnessing PCV-1's excellent photostability and signal-to-noise ratio and by comparing the fluorescence intensity of the two organelles, mitochondria and nucleoli, we developed a powerful analytical assay named organelle ratiometric probing (ORP) that we applied to quantitatively analyze and efficiently assess the viability of individual cells, thereby enabling deeper insights into the potential mechanisms of cell death. In ORP analysis with PCV-1, we identified 0.3 as the cutoff point for assessing whether adding a given drug will cause apparent cytotoxicity, which greatly expands the probe's applicability. To the best of our knowledge, PCV-1 is the first probe to allow visualizing cell death and cell injury under super-resolution imaging, and our proposed analytical assay using it paves the way for quantifying cell viability at the single-cell level.

ABSTRACT:
UNLABELLED: Endothelial cells (ECs) regulate vascular contractility to control regional organ blood flow and systemic blood pressure. Several cation channels are expressed in ECs which regulate arterial contractility. In contrast, the molecular identity and physiological functions of anion channels in ECs is unclear. Here, we generated tamoxifen-inducible, EC-specific TMEM16A knockout ( TMEM16A ecKO) mice to investigate the functional significance of this chloride (Cl - ) channel in the resistance vasculature. Our data demonstrate that TMEM16A channels generate calcium-activated Cl - currents in ECs of control ( TMEM16A fl/fl ) mice that are absent in ECs of TMEM16A ecKO mice. Acetylcholine (ACh), a muscarinic receptor agonist, and GSK101, a TRPV4 agonist, activate TMEM16A currents in ECs. Single molecule localization microscopy data indicate that surface TMEM16A and TRPV4 clusters locate in very close nanoscale proximity, with ∼18% exhibiting overlap in ECs. ACh stimulates TMEM16A currents by activating Ca 2+ influx through surface TRPV4 channels without altering the size or density of TMEM16A or TRPV4 surface clusters, their spatial proximity or colocalization. ACh-induced activation of TMEM16A channels in ECs produces hyperpolarization in pressurized arteries. ACh, GSK101 and intraluminal ATP, another vasodilator, all dilate pressurized arteries through TMEM16A channel activation in ECs. Furthermore, EC-specific knockout of TMEM16A channels elevates systemic blood pressure in conscious mice. In summary, these data indicate that vasodilators stimulate TRPV4 channels, leading to Ca 2+ -dependent activation of nearby TMEM16A channels in ECs to produce arterial hyperpolarization, vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. We identify TMEM16A as an anion channel present in ECs that regulates arterial contractility and blood pressure. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: Vasodilators stimulate TRPV4 channels, leading to calcium-dependent activation of nearby TMEM16A channels in ECs to produce arterial hyperpolarization, vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure.

TITLE: The initiation and early development of the tubulin-containing cytoskeleton in the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii.

PMID: 38106158

ABSTRACT:
The tubulin-containing cytoskeleton of the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii includes several distinct structures: the conoid, formed of 14 ribbon-like tubulin polymers, and the array of 22 cortical microtubules (MTs) rooted in the apical polar ring. Here we analyze the structure of developing daughter parasites using both 3D-SIM and expansion microscopy. Cortical MTs and the conoid start to develop almost simultaneously, but from distinct precursors near the centrioles. Cortical MTs are initiated in a fixed sequence, starting around the periphery of a short arc that extends to become a complete circle. The conoid also develops from an open arc into a full circle, with a fixed spatial relationship to the centrioles. The patterning of the MT array starts from a "blueprint" with ∼ 5-fold symmetry, switching to 22-fold rotational symmetry in the final product, revealing a major structural rearrangement during daughter growth. The number of MT is essentially invariant in the wild-type array, but is perturbed by the loss of some structural components of the apical polar ring. This study provides insights into the development of tubulin-containing structures that diverge from conventional models, insights that are critical for understanding the evolutionary paths leading to construction and divergence of cytoskeletal frameworks.

ABSTRACT:
The plasma membrane of cells is covered by proteins, glycoproteins, and glycolipids with molecular heights ranging from just a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. Formation of cell-cell contacts and signal transduction by individual receptors can be dependent on both the average height of a cell's glycocalyx and the specific height of individual receptors, sometimes with nanometer-scale sensitivity. While super-resolution imaging techniques allow molecular distances to be measured with the sub-diffraction limited resolution, typically 10 nm in the lateral direction and 100 nm in the axial direction, measurements of molecular heights at the single nanometer scale on native cell membranes have been difficult to obtain. Cell surface optical profilometry (CSOP) is a simple and rapid method that achieves nanometer height resolution by localizing fluorophores at the tip and base of cell surface molecules and determining their separation with high precision by radially averaging across many molecules. Here we describe how to make CSOP measurements of multi-domain proteins on model membrane surfaces as well as native cell surfaces.

ABSTRACT:
Using single-molecule displacement/diffusivity mapping (SM d M), an emerging super-resolution microscopy method, here we quantify, at nanoscale resolution, the diffusion of a typical fluorescent protein (FP) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion of living mammalian cells. We thus show that the diffusion coefficients D in both organelles are ~40% of that in the cytoplasm, with the latter exhibiting higher spatial inhomogeneities. Moreover, we unveil that diffusions in the ER lumen and the mitochondrial matrix are markedly impeded when the FP is given positive, but not negative, net charges. Calculation shows most intraorganellar proteins as negatively charged, thus a mechanism to impede the diffusion of positively charged proteins. However, we further identify the ER protein PPIB as an exception with a positive net charge, and experimentally show that the removal of this positive charge elevates its intra-ER diffusivity. We thus unveil a sign-asymmetric protein charge effect on the nanoscale intraorganellar diffusion.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule measurements provide statistical distributions of molecular properties, in addition to the ensemble averages. Evanescent detection approaches have been widely used for single-molecule detection because the evanescent field can significantly enhance the light-analyte interaction and reduce the background noise. However, current evanescent single-molecule detection systems mostly require specially designed sensing components. Here, we show that single proteins can be imaged on a plain cover glass surface by detecting the evanescent waves scattered by the target molecules. This allows us to quantify the protein-antibody interactions at the single-molecule level. This protocol describes a label-free single-molecule imaging approach with conventional consumables and may pave the road for detecting single molecules with commercial optical microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Extracellular microvesicles (MVs) are released into the circulation in large numbers during acute systemic inflammation, yet little is known of their intravascular cell/tissue-specific interactions under these conditions. We recently described a dramatic increase in the uptake of intravenously injected MVs by monocytes marginated within the pulmonary vasculature, in a mouse model of low-dose lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. To investigate the mechanisms of enhanced MV uptake by monocytes, we developed an in vitro model using in vivo derived monocytes. Although mouse blood is a convenient source, monocyte numbers are too low for in vitro experimentation. In contrast, differentiated bone marrow monocytes are abundant, but they are rapidly mobilized during systemic inflammation, and thus no longer available. Instead, we developed a protocol using marginated monocytes from the pulmonary vasculature as an anatomically relevant and abundant source. Mice are sacrificed by terminal anesthesia, the lungs inflated and perfused via the pulmonary artery. Perfusate cell populations are evaluated by flow cytometry, combined with in vitro generated fluorescently labelled MVs, and incubated in suspension for up to one hour. Washed cells are analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify MV uptake and confocal microscopy to localize MVs within cells (O'Dea et al., 2020). Using this perfusion-based method, substantial numbers of marginated pulmonary vascular monocytes are recovered, allowing multiple in vitro tests to be performed from a single mouse donor. As MV uptake profiles were comparable to those observed in vivo, this method is suitable for physiologically relevant high throughput mechanistic studies on mouse monocytes under in vitro conditions.

ABSTRACT:
Tissue clearing followed by light-sheet microscopy (LSFM) enables cellular-resolution imaging of intact brain structure, allowing quantitative analysis of structural changes caused by genetic or environmental perturbations. Whole-brain imaging results in more accurate quantification of cells and the study of region-specific differences that may be missed with commonly used microscopy of physically sectioned tissue. Using light-sheet microscopy to image cleared brains greatly increases acquisition speed as compared to confocal microscopy. Although these images produce very large amounts of brain structural data, most computational tools that perform feature quantification in images of cleared tissue are limited to counting sparse cell populations, rather than all nuclei. Here, we demonstrate NuMorph (Nuclear-Based Morphometry), a group of analysis tools, to quantify all nuclei and nuclear markers within annotated regions of a postnatal day 4 (P4) mouse brain after clearing and imaging on a light-sheet microscope. We describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain volume prior to shrinkage caused by tissue clearing dehydration steps, tissue clearing using the iDISCO+ method, including immunolabeling, followed by light-sheet microscopy using a commercially available platform to image mouse brains at cellular resolution. We then demonstrate this image analysis pipeline using NuMorph, which is used to correct intensity differences, stitch image tiles, align multiple channels, count nuclei, and annotate brain regions through registration to publicly available atlases. We designed this approach using publicly available protocols and software, allowing any researcher with the necessary microscope and computational resources to perform these techniques. These tissue clearing, imaging, and computational tools allow measurement and quantification of the three-dimensional (3D) organization of cell-types in the cortex and should be widely applicable to any wild-type/knockout mouse study design.

TITLE: Imaging Neutrophil Migration in the Mouse Skin to Investigate Subcellular Membrane Remodeling Under Physiological Conditions.

PMID: 35635466
DOI: 10.3791/63581

ABSTRACT:
The study of immune cell recruitment and function in tissues has been a very active field over the last two decades. Neutrophils are among the first immune cells to reach the site of inflammation and to participate in the innate immune response during infection or tissue damage. So far, neutrophil migration has been successfully visualized using various in vitro experimental systems based on uniform stimulation, or confined migration under agarose, or micro-fluidic channels. However, these models do not recapitulate the complex microenvironment that neutrophils encounter in vivo. The development of multiphoton microscopy (MPM)-based techniques, such as intravital subcellular microscopy (ISMic), offer a unique tool to visualize and investigate neutrophil dynamics at subcellular resolutions under physiological conditions. In particular, the ear of a live anesthetized mouse provides an experimental advantage to follow neutrophil interstitial migration in real-time due to its ease of accessibility and lack of surgical exposure. ISMic provides the optical resolution, speed, and depth of acquisition necessary to track both cellular and, more importantly, subcellular processes in 3D over time (4D). Moreover, multi-modal imaging of the interstitial microenvironment (i.e., blood vessels, resident cells, extracellular matrix) can be readily accomplished using a combination of transgenic mice expressing select fluorescent markers, exogenous labeling via fluorescent probes, tissue intrinsic fluorescence, and second/third harmonic generated signals. This protocol describes 1) the preparation of neutrophils for adoptive transfer into the mouse ear, 2) different settings for optimal sub-cellular imaging, 3) strategies to minimize motion artifacts while maintaining a physiological response, 4) examples of membrane remodeling observed in neutrophils using ISMic, and 5) a workflow for the quantitative analysis of membrane remodeling in migrating neutrophils in vivo.

ABSTRACT:
The peel-blot cryo-EM grid preparation technique is a significantly modified back-injection method with the objective of achieving a reduction in layers of multi-layered samples. This removal of layers prior to plunge freezing can aid in reducing sample thickness to a level suitable for cryo-EM data collection, improving sample flatness, and facilitating image processing. The peel-blot technique allows for the separation of multilamellar membranes into single layers, of layered 2D crystals into individual crystals, and of stacked, sheet-like structures of soluble proteins to likewise be separated into single layers. The high sample thickness of these types of samples frequently poses insurmountable problems for cryo-EM data collection and cryo-EM image processing, especially when the microscope stage must be tilted for data collection. Furthermore, grids of high concentrations of any of these samples can be prepared for efficient data collection since sample concentration prior to grid preparation can be increased and the peel-blot technique adjusted to result in a dense distribution of single-layered specimen.

TITLE: Directly Measuring Forces within Reconstituted Active Microtubule Bundles.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2022)
PMID: 35635475
DOI: 10.3791/63819

ABSTRACT:
Microtubule networks are employed in cells to accomplish a wide range of tasks, ranging from acting as tracks for vesicle transport to working as specialized arrays during mitosis to regulate chromosome segregation. Proteins that interact with microtubules include motors such as kinesins and dynein, which can generate active forces and directional motion, as well as non-motor proteins that crosslink filaments into higher-order networks or regulate filament dynamics. To date, biophysical studies of microtubule-associated proteins have overwhelmingly focused on the role of single motor proteins needed for vesicle transport, and significant progress has been made in elucidating the force-generating properties and mechanochemical regulation of kinesins and dyneins. However, for processes in which microtubules act both as cargo and track, such as during filament sliding within the mitotic spindle, much less is understood about the biophysical regulation of ensembles of the crosslinking proteins involved. Here, we detail our methodology for directly probing force generation and response within crosslinked microtubule minimal networks reconstituted from purified microtubules and mitotic proteins. Microtubule pairs are crosslinked by proteins of interest, one microtubule is immobilized to a microscope coverslip, and the second microtubule is manipulated by an optical trap. Simultaneous total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy allows for multichannel visualization of all the components of this microtubule network as the filaments slide apart to generate force. We also demonstrate how these techniques can be used to probe pushing forces exerted by kinesin-5 ensembles and how viscous braking forces arise between sliding microtubule pairs crosslinked by the mitotic MAP PRC1. These assays provide insights into the mechanisms of spindle assembly and function and can be more broadly adapted to study dense microtubule network mechanics in diverse contexts, such as the axon and dendrites of neurons and polar epithelial cells.

ABSTRACT:
Liposomal nanocarriers are intensively investigated as delivery vehicles for photoactivatable agents used in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The uptake, intracellular distribution, and processing of the nanocarriers are of paramount importance for the effectiveness of the therapy; visualization and analysis of these processes can, therefore, stimulate the development of improved PDT modalities. Here we describe a simple protocol, based on super-resolution imaging, that can be used for detailed quantification of concentration, distribution, and size of individual lipid nanocarriers in adherent mammalian cells.

ABSTRACT:
Antimicrobial-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes over 200,000 deaths globally each year. Current assays of antimicrobial resistance require knowledge of the mutations that confer drug resistance or long periods of culture time to test growth under drug pressure. We present ODELAM (One-cell Doubling Evaluation of Living Arrays of Mycobacterium), a time-lapse microscopy-based method that observes individual cells growing into microcolonies. This protocol describes sample and media preparation and contains instructions for assembling the ODELAM sample chamber. The ODELAM sample chamber is designed to provide a controlled environment to safely observe the growth of Mtb by time-lapse microscopy on an inverted wide-field microscope. A brief description of the ODELAM software is also provided here. ODELAM tracks up to 1500 colony forming units per region of interest and can observe up to 96 regions for up to seven days in a single experiment. This technique allows the quantification of population heterogeneity. ODELAM enables rapid quantitative measurements of growth kinetics in as few as 30 h under a wide variety of environmental conditions.

ABSTRACT:
The phenomenon of reversible liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins underlies the formation of membraneless organelles, which are crucial for cellular processes such as signalling and transport. In addition, it is also of great interest to uncover the mechanisms of further irreversible maturation of the functional dense liquid phase into aberrant insoluble assemblies due to its implication in human disease. Recent advances in methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) have made it possible to study protein condensates at the nanometer level, providing unprecedented information on the nature of the intermolecular interactions governing phase separation. Here, we provide an in-depth description of a protocol for the characterisation of the morphology, stiffness, and chemical properties of protein condensates using infrared nanospectroscopy (AFM-IR).

ABSTRACT:
Neural crest cells (NCCs) are vertebrate embryonic multipotent cells that can migrate and differentiate into a wide array of cell types that give rise to various organs and tissues. Tissue stiffness produces mechanical force, a physical cue that plays a critical role in NCC differentiation; however, the mechanism remains unclear. The method described here provides detailed information for the optimized generation of polyacrylamide hydrogels of varying stiffness, the accurate measurement of such stiffness, and the evaluation of the impact of mechanical signals in O9-1 cells, a NCC line that mimics in vivo NCCs. Hydrogel stiffness was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and indicated different stiffness levels accordingly. O9-1 NCCs cultured on hydrogels of varying stiffness showed different cell morphology and gene expression of stress fibers, which indicated varying biological effects caused by mechanical signal changes. Moreover, this established that varying the hydrogel stiffness resulted in an efficient in vitro system to manipulate mechanical signaling by altering gel stiffness and analyzing the molecular and genetic regulation in NCCs. O9-1 NCCs can differentiate into a wide range of cell types under the influence of the corresponding differentiation media, and it is convenient to manipulate chemical signals in vitro. Therefore, this in vitro system is a powerful tool to study the role of mechanical signaling in NCCs and its interaction with chemical signals, which will help researchers better understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms of neural crest development and diseases.

PMID: 34125104
DOI: 10.3791/62155

ABSTRACT:
Visual system function requires the establishment of precise tissue and organ structures. In the vertebrate eye, structural defects are a common cause of visual impairment, yet mechanisms of eye morphogenesis are still poorly understood. The basic organization of the embryonic eye is conserved throughout vertebrates, thus live imaging of zebrafish embryos has become a powerful approach to directly observe eye development at real time under normal and pathological conditions. Dynamic cell processes including movements, morphologies, interactions, division, and death can be visualized in the embryo. We have developed methods for uniform labeling of subcellular structures and timelapse confocal microscopy of early eye development in zebrafish. This protocol outlines the method of generating capped mRNA for injection into the 1-cell zebrafish embryo, mounting embryos at optic vesicle stage (~12 hours post fertilization, hpf), and performing multi-dimensional timelapse imaging of optic cup morphogenesis on a laser scanning confocal microscope, such that multiple datasets are acquired sequentially in the same imaging session. Such an approach yields data that can be used for a variety of purposes, including cell tracking, volume measurements, three-dimensional (3D) rendering, and visualization. Our approaches allow us to pinpoint the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving optic cup development, in both wild type and genetic mutant conditions. These methods can be employed directly by other groups or adapted to visualize many additional aspects of zebrafish eye development.

ABSTRACT:
HIV-1 causes a chronic infection that affects more than 37 million people worldwide. People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) experience comorbidity related to chronic inflammation despite antiretroviral therapy. However, these inflammatory signaling has not been fully characterized. The role of early entry events on the activation of cellular signaling events and downstream gene expression has not been captured at the single-cell level. Here the authors describe a method that applies principles of live-cell fluorescence microscopy to an automated single-cell platform that cultures and images cells over user-customized time courses, allowing for high-throughput analysis of dynamic cellular processes. This assay can track single-cell live fluorescence microscopy of early events that immediately follow HIV-1 infection, notably the influx of calcium that accompanies exposure to the virus and the development of productive infection using a fluorescent reporter virus. MT-4 cells are loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye and cultured in isolated pens on a nanofluidic device. The cultured cells are infected with an HIV-1 reporter virus (HIV-1 NLCI). A fluorescence microscope positioned above the nanofluidic device measures calcium influx over an 8-min time course following acute HIV-1 exposure. HIV-1 productive infection is measured in those same cells over a 4-day interval. Imaging data from these time courses are analyzed to define virus-host receptor interactions and signaling pathway dynamics. The authors present an integrated, scalable alternative to traditional imaging methods using a novel optofluidic platform capable of single-cell sorting, culturing, imaging, and software automation. This assay can measure the kinetics of events under various conditions, including cell type, agonist, or antagonist effect, while measuring an array of parameters. This is the first established method for nanofluidic high-throughput longitudinal single-cell culture and imaging: This technique can be broadly adapted to study cellular signaling kinetics and dynamic molecular interactions.

ABSTRACT:
The development of chemical and biological coupling technologies in recent years has made possible of protein polymers engineering. We have developed an enzymatic method for building polyproteins using a protein ligase OaAEP1 (asparagine endopeptidase 1) and protease TEV (tobacco etching virus). Using a mobile TEV protease site compatible with the OaAEP1 ligation, we achieved a stepwise polymerization of the protein on the surface. The produced polyprotein can be verified by protein unfolding scenario using atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS). Thus, this study provides an alternative method for polyprotein engineering and immobilization.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence microscopy has become a powerful tool to investigate proteins in their natural environment. Well-established techniques like widefield and confocal fluorescence microscopy have commonly been used for decades to visualize biomolecules in single cells and tissue sections. Live cell microscopy allows for the investigation of biomolecular trafficking, and other specialized techniques, such as proximity ligation assays (PLA) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), can be used to study interactions between biomolecules of interest. Finally, with the most recent rise of optical super-resolution microscopy, we can investigate target biomolecules in situ with unprecedented detail on the nanometer scale. Here, we discuss various optical microscopy techniques that have successfully been used to image MIF. We highlight applications, advantages, and limitations of each technique. The techniques described here can easily be adapted to investigate other target proteins, their localization, interaction partners, and mechanisms of action.

ABSTRACT:
Auditory hair cells are the mechanical sensors of sound waves in the inner ear, and the stereocilia, which are actin-rich protrusions of different heights on the apical surfaces of hair cells, are responsible for the transduction of sound waves into electrical signals. As a crucial actin-binding and bundling protein, espin is able to cross-link actin filaments and is therefore necessary for stereocilia morphogenesis. Using advanced super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy, we imaged espin expression at the sub-diffraction limit along the whole length of the stereocilia in outer hair cells and inner hair cells in order to better understand espin's function in the development of stereocilia.

ABSTRACT:
Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) has wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) expressing the Forssman antigen (FA). Two lectins, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) and Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), are known to bind FA. To determine the molecular structure targeted by these two lectins, different pneumococcal strains were studied for DBA/HPA binding with flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Genetic experiments were used to further examine the lectins' molecular target. Twelve strains were positive for DBA binding, whereas three were negative. Super-resolution microscopy showed that DBA stained only the subcapsular area of pneumococci. The three DBA nonbinders showed no phosphorylcholine esterase (Pce) activity in vitro, whereas 10 DBA binders displayed Pce activity (the remaining two strains were DBA binders with no Pce activity in vitro). The pcegene sequence for 10 representative strains revealed two functional pce alleles, the previously recognized "allele A" and a newly discovered "allele B" (with 12 additional nucleotides). Isolates with allele B showed no Pce activity in vitro but did bind to DBA, indicating allele B Pce is functional in vivo. Genetic transfer experiments confirmed that either allele is sufficient (and necessary) for DBA binding. The three DBA nonbinders had various mutations that affected Pce function. Observations with HPA were identical to those with DBA. We show that DBA and HPA bind only to the WTA/LTA of pneumococcal isolates with a functional Pce enzyme. A newly discovered Pce variant (allele B) is functional in vivo but nonfunctional when assayed in vitro.

ABSTRACT:
In our recently published paper, we highlight that during normal aging of C. elegans age-dependent aggregates of proteins form and lead to functional decline of tissues. The protocol described here details the isolation of two proteins from C. elegans in their aggregated amyloid-like form, casein kinase I isoform alpha (KIN-19) and Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA (RHO-1). We used nickel beads to isolate His-tagged KIN-19 and RHO-1, and thus permitting the isolation of both small and large aggregated or fibrillary forms of the proteins. We characterized their morphology by transmission electron microscopy. We further expressed RFP-tagged proteins and stained them with a fluorescent molecule, thioflavin T, which identifies β-sheet structures, and which is a defining feature of amyloid fibrils. We further applied structured illumination microscopy to determine the level of colocalization between RFP and thioflavin T.

DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.3396

ABSTRACT:
Centrosome numerical abnormalities have been reported in a variety of tumors. Centrosome numbers in cancer cells display both inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity. The over production of centrosomes (centrosome amplification) is unique in cancer cells and is a promising target for therapy. Thus, a method to quantify centrosome numbers on a single cell level is needed. Here, we describe a protocol to quantify centrosome numbers in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples by multiplexing antibodies to define bona fide centrosomes and cell borders. Centrosomes in single cells are identified using high resolution immunofluorescent microscopy with Z-sectioning. This protocol is easy to perform and has been used to quantify centrosome numbers on a single cell level in a variety of human tissue samples.

ABSTRACT:
In glomerular diseases, podocytes are one type of cells involved in dysfunction of glomerular filtration. In these conditions, podocyte proteins expression change. Therefore, immunofluorescent staining of podocytes can be performed to visualize podocyte localization of proteins of interest. In this protocol, we detail a method to stain podocytes with a specific marker WT-1 (Wilms Tumor-1) for "in situ" podocyte analysis by immunofluorescent microscopy, more informative technique than other techniques (as Western blot).

ABSTRACT:
Cell motility has been extensively studied in in vitro models using fibroblasts and keratocytes, but the cell type-specific mechanisms underlying migration of lineage- or disease-specific cells, such as neural and glial progenitor cells, remain an active field for investigation. The migrating neural and glial progenitor cells contribute to the development, tissue repair and tumor invasion in the central nervous system (CNS). Cell migration is a highly dynamic process which relies on membranous protrusions to assemble, extend, disassemble and retract. In the CNS, the motility of neural and glial progenitor cells is affected by various cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms such as signaling molecules, actin and microtubule interactions, and environmental cues. Here, we described a live-cell migration assay for use in the assessment of neural and glial progenitor cell migration. We first will demonstrate the procedures for isolating and culturing neural and glial progenitor cells. Next, we will demonstrate the acquisition of time-lapse images using phase contrast microscopy, the methods for quantification and the analyses of various motility parameters including speed, velocity, straightness and leading-edge dynamics. This method allows researchers to dissect the mechanisms of cell motility in response to different environmental cues, such as chemoattractive and repulsive signals, matrix adhesiveness and stiffness. This assay also allows researchers to study migration of pharmacologically and genetically manipulated cells.

TITLE: Super-Resolution Microscopy of Phloem Proteins.
AUTHORS: Stanfield Ryan C, Schulz Alexander
JOURNAL: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) (2019)
PMID: 31197788
DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-9562-2_7

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution microscopy bridges the gap between light and electron microscopy and gives new opportunities for the study of proteins that contribute to phloem function. The established super-resolution techniques are derived from fluorescence microscopy and depend on fluorescent dyes, proteins tagged with GFP variants or fluorochrome-decorated antibodies. Compared with confocal microscopy they improve the resolution between 2.5 and 10 times and, thus, allow a much more precise (co-) localization of membranes, plasmodesmata, and structural proteins. However, they are limited to thin tissue slices rather than intact plant organs and can only show immobilized or only slowly moving targets. Accordingly, the first super-resolution micrographs of the phloem were recorded from fixed tissue which was sectioned using a vibratome or microtome. As with transmission electron microscopy, preparation of phloem tissue for super-resolution microscopy is challenged by the sudden pressures release when dissecting the functional tissue (see Chapter 2 ).This chapter describes a protocol for investigation of proteins in the plasma membranes of sieve elements and companion cells. It illustrates how high-resolution fluorescence imaging can provide information that could not be obtained with confocal or electron microscopy. Further, a brief introduction outlines the theoretical background of super-resolution techniques suitable for phloem imaging and summarizes the findings of the first available super-resolution studies on the phloem. The protocol focusses on the crucial steps for super-resolution microscopy of immunolocalized phloem proteins, adjusted to the use of three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM).

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2018)
PMID: 30176010
DOI: 10.3791/58135

ABSTRACT:
This report focuses on the synthesis of an N-terminus 1,2-dithiolane modified self-assembling peptide and the characterization of the resulting self-assembled supramolecular structures. The synthetic route takes advantage of solid-phase peptide synthesis with the on-resin coupling of the dithiolane precursor molecule, 3-(acetylthio)-2-(acetylthiomethyl)propanoic acid, and the microwave-assisted thioacetate deprotection of the peptide N-terminus before final cleavage from the resin to yield the 1,2-dithiolane modified peptide. After the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification of the 1,2-dithiolane peptide, derived from the nucleating core of the Aβ peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, the peptide is shown to self-assemble into cross-β amyloid fibers. Protocols to characterize the amyloid fibers by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are presented. The methods of N-terminal modification with a 1,2-dithiolane moiety to well-characterized self-assembling peptides can now be explored as model systems to develop post-assembly modification strategies and explore dynamic covalent chemistry on supramolecular peptide nanofiber surfaces.

ABSTRACT:
The importance of sharing experimental data in neuroscience grows with the amount and complexity of data acquired and various techniques used to obtain and process these data. However, the majority of experimental data, especially from individual studies of regular-sized laboratories never reach wider research community. A graphical user interface (GUI) engine called Neurovascular Network Explorer 2.0 (NNE 2.0) has been created as a tool for simple and low-cost sharing and exploring of vascular imaging data. NNE 2.0 interacts with a database containing optogenetically-evoked dilation/constriction time-courses of individual vessels measured in mice somatosensory cortex in vivo by 2-photon microscopy. NNE 2.0 enables selection and display of the time-courses based on different criteria (subject, branching order, cortical depth, vessel diameter, arteriolar tree) as well as simple mathematical manipulation (e.g. averaging, peak-normalization) and data export. It supports visualization of the vascular network in 3D and enables localization of the individual functional vessel diameter measurements within vascular trees. NNE 2.0, its source code, and the corresponding database are freely downloadable from UCSD Neurovascular Imaging Laboratory website1. The source code can be utilized by the users to explore the associated database or as a template for databasing and sharing their own experimental results provided the appropriate format.

ABSTRACT:
The present protocol to visualize living bacteria at the pore level of cauliflower hydathodes is simple and trained users in confocal microscopy can execute it successfully. It can be easily adapted to capture images with other plant-microorganism interactions at the leaf surface and should be useful to obtain important information on pore and stomatal biology. A critical limitation to methods used to observe plant-microorganism interactions in the pore is the application of too much pressure to the sample during observations and z-stack acquisitions. To solve this issue, we recommend the use of a long working-distance water immersion objective lens that allows observations even with thick samples.

ABSTRACT:
AFM imaging is a powerful technique for the study of protein-DNA interactions. This single molecule method allows the simultaneous resolution of different molecules and molecular assemblies in a heterogeneous sample. In the particular context of DNA interacting protein systems, different protein complex forms and their corresponding binding positions on target sites containing DNA fragments can thus be distinguished. Here, an application of AFM to the study of DNA lesion recognition in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) systems is presented. The procedures of DNA and protein sample preparations are described and experimental as well as analytical details of the experiments are provided. The data allow important conclusions on the strategies by which target site verification may be achieved by the NER proteins. Interestingly, they indicate different approaches of lesion recognition and identification for the eukaryotic NER system, depending on the type of lesion. Furthermore, distinct structural properties of the two different helicases involved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic NER result in and explain the different strategies observed for these two systems. Importantly, these experimental and analytical approaches can be applied not only to the study of DNA repair but also very similarly to other DNA interacting protein systems such as those involved in replication or transcription processes.

TITLE: Live Cell Imaging and 3D Analysis of Angiotensin Receptor Type 1a Trafficking in Transfected Human Embryonic Kidney Cells Using Confocal Microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Live-cell imaging is used to simultaneously capture time-lapse images of angiotensin type 1a receptors (AT1aR) and intracellular compartments in transfected human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK) cells following stimulation with angiotensin II (Ang II). HEK cells are transiently transfected with plasmid DNA containing AT1aR tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Lysosomes are identified with a red fluorescent dye. Live-cell images are captured on a laser scanning confocal microscope after Ang II stimulation and analyzed by software in three dimensions (3D, voxels) over time. Live-cell imaging enables investigations into receptor trafficking and avoids confounds associated with fixation, and in particular, the loss or artefactual displacement of EGFP-tagged membrane receptors. Thus, as individual cells are tracked through time, the subcellular localization of receptors can be imaged and measured. Images must be acquired sufficiently rapidly to capture rapid vesicle movement. Yet, at faster imaging speeds, the number of photons collected is reduced. Compromises must also be made in the selection of imaging parameters like voxel size in order to gain imaging speed. Significant applications of live-cell imaging are to study protein trafficking, migration, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy and protein-protein interaction and dynamics, to name but a few.

ABSTRACT:
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that can be caused by inherited mutations in the gene encoding copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). The structural instability of SOD1 and the detection of SOD1-positive inclusions in familial-ALS patients supports a potential causal role for misfolded and/or aggregated SOD1 in ALS pathology. In this study, we describe the development of a cell-based assay designed to quantify the dynamics of SOD1 aggregation in living cells by high content screening approaches. Using lentiviral vectors, we generated stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant A4V SOD1 tagged with yellow fluorescent protein and found that both proteins were expressed in the cytosol without any sign of aggregation. Interestingly, only SOD1 A4V stably expressed in HEK-293, but not in U2OS or SH-SY5Y cell lines, formed aggregates upon proteasome inhibitor treatment. We show that it is possible to quantify aggregation based on dose-response analysis of various proteasome inhibitors, and to track aggregate-formation kinetics by time-lapse microscopy. Our approach introduces the possibility of quantifying the effect of ALS mutations on the role of SOD1 in aggregate formation as well as screening for small molecules that prevent SOD1 A4V aggregation.

ABSTRACT:
Synovial sarcoma is one of the poorly differentiated malignant soft tissue tumour occuring commonly among young adults in the extremities. We report a 50-year-old female presenting with a soft tissue mass in the right palm. On examination, a single firm and non tender swelling was noticed adjacent to the thenar muscles. Radiology suggested a benign soft tissue lesion. The swelling, clinically thought to be a lipoma, was excised and sent for histopathological examination. Microscopy showed a highly cellular tumour arranged in nests, cords and pseudo glandular pattern separated by dense fibrocollagenous tissue. An interesting and baffling finding was the presence of a distinct mucin vacuole in many of the tumour cells. A diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma with epithelial features was considered and a panel of immunohistochemical stains done. Tumour cells showed strong positivity for cytokeratin 7, vimentin, EMA & Bcl2. CD 99 and S100 were focally positive. CD 34 and CEA were negative. In view of the above microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of monophasic synovial sarcoma of epithelial type was rendered. This case is being documented for the rare morphological appearance of mucin vacuoles in a monophasic epithelial type synovial sarcoma.

ABSTRACT:
The time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) in on-chip interconnect stacks is one of the most critical failure mechanisms for microelectronic devices. The aggressive scaling of feature sizes, both on devices and interconnects, leads to serious challenges to ensure the required product reliability. Standard reliability tests and post-mortem failure analysis provide only limited information about the physics of failure mechanisms and degradation kinetics. Therefore it is necessary to develop new experimental approaches and procedures to study the TDDB failure mechanisms and degradation kinetics in particular. In this paper, an in situ experimental methodology in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) is demonstrated to investigate the TDDB degradation and failure mechanisms in Cu/ULK interconnect stacks. High quality imaging and chemical analysis are used to study the kinetic process. The in situ electrical test is integrated into the TEM to provide an elevated electrical field to the dielectrics. Electron tomography is utilized to characterize the directed Cu diffusion in the insulating dielectrics. This experimental procedure opens a possibility to study the failure mechanism in interconnect stacks of microelectronic products, and it could also be extended to other structures in active devices.

ABSTRACT:
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating clinical condition causing permanent changes in sensorimotor and autonomic functions of the spinal cord (SC) below the site of injury. The secondary ischemia that develops following the initial mechanical insult is a serious complication of the SCI and severely impairs the function and viability of surviving neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the SC. In addition, ischemia is also responsible for the growth of lesion during chronic phase of injury and interferes with the cellular repair and healing processes. Thus there is a need to develop a spinal cord ischemia model for studying the mechanisms of ischemia-induced pathology. Focal ischemia induced by photothrombosis (PT) is a minimally invasive and very well established procedure used to investigate the pathology of ischemia-induced cell death in the brain. Here, we describe the use of PT to induce an ischemic lesion in the spinal cord of mice. Following retro-orbital sinus injection of Rose Bengal, the posterior spinal vein and other capillaries on the dorsal surface of SC were irradiated with a green light resulting in the formation of a thrombus and thus ischemia in the affected region. Results from histology and immunochemistry studies show that PT-induced ischemia caused spinal cord infarction, loss of neurons and reactive gliosis. Using this technique a highly reproducible and relatively easy model of SCI in mice can be achieved that would serve the purpose of scientific investigations into the mechanisms of ischemia induced cell death as well as the efficacy of neuroprotective drugs. This model will also allow exploration of the pathological changes that occur following SCI in live mice like axonal degeneration and regeneration, neuronal and astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling using two-photon microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence microscopy is an important tool in all fields of biology to visualize structures and monitor dynamic processes and distributions. Contrary to conventional microscopy techniques such as confocal microscopy, which are limited by their spatial resolution, super-resolution techniques such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) have made it possible to observe and quantify structure and processes on the single molecule level. Here, we describe a method to image and quantify the molecular distribution of membrane-associated proteins in two and three dimensions with nanometer resolution.

ABSTRACT:
Monitoring cellular communication by intravital deep-tissue multi-photon microscopy is the key for understanding the fate of immune cells within thick tissue samples and organs in health and disease. By controlling the scanning pattern in multi-photon microscopy and applying appropriate numerical algorithms, we developed a striped-illumination approach, which enabled us to achieve 3-fold better axial resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. contrast, in more than 100 µm tissue depth within highly scattering tissue of lymphoid organs as compared to standard multi-photon microscopy. The acquisition speed as well as photobleaching and photodamage effects were similar to standard photo-multiplier-based technique, whereas the imaging depth was slightly lower due to the use of field detectors. By using the striped-illumination approach, we are able to observe the dynamics of immune complex deposits on secondary follicular dendritic cells - on the level of a few protein molecules in germinal centers.

ABSTRACT:
Because the lung is a major target organ of metastatic disease, animal models to study the physiology of pulmonary metastases are of great importance. However, very few methods exist to date to investigate lung metastases in a dynamic fashion at the microcirculatory level, due to the difficulty to access the lung with a microscope. Here, an intravital microscopy method is presented to functionally image and quantify the microcirculation of superficial pulmonary metastases in rats, using a closed-chest pulmonary window and automated analysis of blood flow velocity and direction. The utility of this method is demonstrated to measure increases in blood flow velocity in response to pharmacological intervention, and to image the well-known tortuous vasculature of solid tumors. This is the first demonstration of intravital microscopy on pulmonary metastases in a closed-chest model. Because of its minimized invasiveness, as well as due to its relative ease and practicality, this technology has the potential to experience widespread use in laboratories that specialize on pulmonary tumor research.

TITLE: Using fluorescent proteins to monitor glycosome dynamics in the African trypanosome.
AUTHORS: Bauer Sarah, Conlon Meghan, Morris Meredith
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2014)
PMID: 25177828
DOI: 10.3791/51647

ABSTRACT:
Trypanosoma brucei is a kinetoplastid parasite that causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, and a wasting disease, nagana, in cattle. The parasite alternates between the bloodstream of the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector. The composition of many cellular organelles changes in response to these different extracellular conditions. Glycosomes are highly specialized peroxisomes in which many of the enzymes involved in glycolysis are compartmentalized. Glycosome composition changes in a developmental and environmentally regulated manner. Currently, the most common techniques used to study glycosome dynamics are electron and fluorescence microscopy; techniques that are expensive, time and labor intensive, and not easily adapted to high throughput analyses. To overcome these limitations, a fluorescent-glycosome reporter system in which enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) is fused to a peroxisome targeting sequence (PTS2), which directs the fusion protein to glycosomes, has been established. Upon import of the PTS2eYFP fusion protein, glycosomes become fluorescent. Organelle degradation and recycling results in the loss of fluorescence that can be measured by flow cytometry. Large numbers of cells (5,000 cells/sec) can be analyzed in real-time without extensive sample preparation such as fixation and mounting. This method offers a rapid way of detecting changes in organelle composition in response to fluctuating environmental conditions.

TITLE: Design and development of BODIPY-based photoswitchable fluorophores to visualize cell signaling with multispectral super resolution microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Super resolution microscopy (SRM) has overcome the historic spatial resolution limit of light microscopy, enabling fluorescence visualization of cellular structures and multi-protein complexes at the nanometer scale. Using single-molecule localization microscopy, the precise location of a stochastically activated population of photoswitchable fluorophores is determined during the collection of many images to form a single image with resolution of ~10-20 nm, an order of magnitude improvement over conventional microscopy. However, the spectral resolution of current SRM techniques are limited by existing fluorophores with only up to four colors imaged simultaneously, limiting the number of intracellular components that can be studied in a single sample. In the current work, a library of novel BODIPY-based fluorophores was synthesized using a solid phase synthetic platform with the goal of creating a set of photoswitchable fluorophores that can be excited by 5 distinct laser lines but emit throughout the spectral range (450-850 nm) enabling multispectral super resolution microscopy (MSSRM). The photoswitching properties of all new fluorophores were quantified for the following key photoswitching characteristics: (1) the number of photons per on cycle (2) the number of on cycles (switching events), (3) the percentage of time the fluorophore spends in the fluorescent on and off states, and (4) the susceptibility of the fluorophore to photobleaching (time of last event). To ensure the accuracy of our photoswitching measurements, our methodology to detect and quantitate the photoswitching properties of individual fluorophore molecules was validated by comparing measured photoswitching properties of three commercial dyes to published results.1 We also identified two efficient methods to positionally isolate fluorophores on coverglass for screening of the BODIPY-based library.

ABSTRACT:
In this article we describe how to individually label neurons in the embryonic CNS of Drosophila melanogaster by juxtacellular injection of the lipophilic fluorescent membrane marker DiI. This method allows the visualization of neuronal cell morphology in great detail. It is possible to label any cell in the CNS: cell bodies of target neurons are visualized under DIC optics or by expression of a fluorescent genetic marker such as GFP. After labeling, the DiI can be transformed into a permanent brown stain by photoconversion to allow visualization of cell morphology with transmitted light and DIC optics. Alternatively, the DiI-labeled cells can be observed directly with confocal microscopy, enabling genetically introduced fluorescent reporter proteins to be colocalised. The technique can be used in any animal, irrespective of genotype, making it possible to analyze mutant phenotypes at single cell resolution.

TITLE: Live imaging of dorsal root axons after rhizotomy.
AUTHORS: Skuba Andrew, Himes B Timothy, Son Young-Jin
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2011)
PMID: 21912366
DOI: 10.3791/3126

ABSTRACT:
The primary sensory axons injured by spinal root injuries fail to regenerate into the spinal cord, leading to chronic pain and permanent sensory loss. Regeneration of dorsal root (DR) axons into spinal cord is prevented at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), the interface between the CNS and PNS. Our understanding of the molecular and cellular events that prevent regeneration at DREZ is incomplete, in part because complex changes associated with nerve injury have been deduced from postmortem analyses. Dynamic cellular processes, such as axon regeneration, are best studied with techniques that capture real-time events with multiple observations of each living animal. Our ability to monitor neurons serially in vivo has increased dramatically owing to revolutionary innovations in optics and mouse transgenics. Several lines of thy1-GFP transgenic mice, in which subsets of neurons are genetically labeled in distinct fluorescent colors, permit individual neurons to be imaged in vivo(1). These mice have been used extensively for in vivo imaging of muscle(2-4) and brain(5-7), and have provided novel insights into physiological mechanisms that static analyses could not have resolved. Imaging studies of neurons in living spinal cord have only recently begun. Lichtman and his colleagues first demonstrated their feasibility by tracking injured dorsal column (DC) axons with wide-field microscopy(8,9). Multi-photon in vivo imaging of deeply positioned DC axons, microglia and blood vessels has also been accomplished(10). Over the last few years, we have pioneered in applying in vivo imaging to monitor regeneration of DR axons using wide-field microscopy and H line of thy1-YFP mice. These studies have led us to a novel hypothesis about why DR axons are prevented from regenerating within the spinal cord(11). In H line of thy1-YFP mice, distinct YFP+ axons are superficially positioned, which allows several axons to be monitored simultaneously. We have learned that DR axons arriving at DREZ are better imaged in lumbar than in cervical spinal cord. In the present report we describe several strategies that we have found useful to assure successful long-term and repeated imaging of regenerating DR axons. These include methods that eliminate repeated intubation and respiratory interruption, minimize surgery-associated stress and scar formation, and acquire stable images at high resolution without phototoxicity.

ABSTRACT:
Synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102) and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) are two major cytoskeleton proteins in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Both of them belong to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which clusters and anchors glutamate receptors and other proteins at synapses. In our previous study, we found that SAP102 and PSD-95 have different distributions, using combined light/electron microscopy (LM/EM) methods.1 Here, we double labeled endogenous SAP102 and PSD-95 in mature hippocampal neurons, and then took images by two different kinds of super resolution microscopy-Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy (STED) and DeltaVision OMX 3D super resolution microscopy. We found that our 2D and 3D super resolution data were consistent with our previous LM/EM data, showing significant differences in the localization of SAP102 and PSD-95 in spines: SAP102 is distributed in both the PSD and cytoplasm of spines, while PSD-95 is concentrated only in the PSD area. These results indicate functional differences between SAP102 and PSD-95 in synaptic organization and plasticity.

ABSTRACT:
Cryogenic focused ion beam milling with scanning electron microscopy (CryoFIB-SEM) has become the dominant approach for preparing sub-200-nm thick lamellae of cells for cryogenic electron tomography (CryoET). Recently, fluorescence microscopy has been incorporated into CryoFIB-SEM systems to guide lamella production toward fluorescently labeled targets. However, in most implementations, the optical and ion beam imaging systems have distinct focal planes in different regions of the vacuum chamber-functioning effectively as two separate microscopes. This configuration requires image registration between modalities, which often lacks the accuracy needed to reliably target small, rare structures in situ. We present a workflow based on a customized tri-coincident imaging platform that enables simultaneous fluorescence imaging and focused ion beam milling. This allows for real-time fluorescence feedback that can be used to determine when to terminate milling in order to preserve fluorescently labeled structures of interest in the final lamella. Using this approach, we targeted the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in vitrified macrophages and achieved a >60% success rate, confirmed by subsequent cryogenic electron tomography and correlative light and electron microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Controlled gene expression programs have a crucial role in shaping cellular functions and activities. At the core of this process lies the RNA life cycle, ensuring protein products are synthesized in the right place at the right time. Here we detail an integrated protocol for imaging-based highly multiplexed in situ profiling of spatial transcriptome using antibody-based protein comapping (STARmap PLUS), spatial translatome mapping (RIBOmap) and spatiotemporal transcriptome mapping (TEMPOmap). These methods selectively convert targeted RNAs, ribosome-bound mRNAs or metabolically labeled RNAs to DNA amplicons with gene-unique barcodes, which are read out through in situ sequencing under a confocal microscope. Compared with other methods, they provide the analytical capacity to track the spatial and temporal dynamics of thousands of RNA species in intact cells and tissues. Our protocol can be readily performed in laboratories experienced in working with RNA and equipped with confocal microscopy instruments. The wet lab experiments in preparing the amplicon library take 2-3 d, followed by variable sequencing times depending on the sample size and target gene number. The spatially resolved single-cell profiles enable downstream analysis, including cell type classification, cell cycle identification and determination of RNA life cycle kinetic parameters through computational analysis guided by the established tutorials. This spatial omics toolkit will help users to better understand spatial and temporal RNA dynamics in heterogeneous cells and tissues.

Here, we present a protocol to identify the overall phenotype by overlaying images of lymphatic vessels acquired from multiple zebrafish embryos of a genetic background. We describe steps for preparing samples, obtaining confocal images, and their computational alignment. In addition, we supply sample images for testing.

Embryogenesis necessitates the precise orchestration of cellular events to establish tissue patterning, developmental robustness, and viability. Syncytial embryogenesis, as in Drosophila melanogaster, poses added challenges as the synchronous and rapid nuclear divisions prior to cellularization occur within a shared cytoplasm. While the first several rounds of nuclear divisions occur within the center of the embryo, the nuclei progressively migrate peripherally, giving rise to the syncytial blastoderm. This spatial choreography hinges upon the dynamic interplay of actin and microtubules. Actin and microtubules coordinate nuclear division and position while preventing deleterious nuclear collisions. Additionally, the cytoskeleton also facilitates the segregation of organelles and molecular cargoes, including cell fate determinants required for cellular differentiation. As development progresses, actin and microtubules drive cellularization events for both germline and somatic cell lineages. Cytoskeletal disruption causes developmental arrest and embryonic lethality, underscoring its importance for embryogenesis. Given the significance of the cytoskeleton to these events, its visualization remains a cornerstone of cell and developmental biology research. Indeed, studies of the Drosophila embryo cytoskeleton have yielded valuable insights into cell biological mechanisms and developmental pathways conserved in various systems. Nevertheless, achieving optimal preservation of filamentous cytoskeletal structures poses technical challenges. Here, we present an embryo fixation method tailored to enhance the visualization of actin and microtubules via standard light microscopy approaches. This protocol complements immunofluorescence and molecular labeling techniques, including the direct labeling of fluorescently tagged proteins or mRNAs. By enabling detailed analysis of the cytoskeleton, this method expands opportunities to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying embryo development and related processes. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
INTRODUCTION: Dysregulated cell cycle progression is a hallmark of cancer, promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation. Growth arrest-specific 2 like 3 (GAS2L3), which is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, correlates with poor clinical outcomes. However, the role of GAS2L3 in HCC pathogenesis remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which GAS2L3 contributes to cytokinesis and hyperproliferation of HCC cells. METHODS: Loss-of-function assays of GAS2L3 were performed to assess midbody assembly, a process essential for cytokinesis. By analyzing protein structure, we predicted liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) potential of GAS2L3, which was validated via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), time-lapse imaging, and in vitro droplet formation assays. Additionally, we generated an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)-deficient model to investigate the role of IDR in LLPS and its effects on cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, and HCC tumorigenicity. RESULTS: Highly expressed GAS2L3 localizes to the midbody and accelerates the cytokinesis of HCC cells by facilitating the recruitment of the charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B). Notably, EGFP-GAS2L3 aggregates in the midbody exhibit dynamic behavior. Structural analysis and experimental evidence confirm GAS2L3 undergoes phase separation via its IDR. GAS2L3 scaffolds the CHMP4B condensate formation at midbody through phase separation, thereby accelerating cytokinesis in HCC cells. Moreover, GAS2L3 knockdown or IDR deletion in HCC cells leads to defective cytokinesis, G1 arrest, and significant tumorigenicity inhibition. CONCLUSION: GAS2L3 critically regulates cytokinesis in HCC through LLPS-mediated remodeling of midbody abscission microenvironment. These findings reveal novel insights into HCC hyperproliferation and suggest GAS2L3 as a potential therapeutic target.

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: Ultrahigh dose rate (FLASH) radiation therapy is reported to reduce normal tissue toxicity while maintaining tumor control; however, mechanism(s) remain obscure. To study FLASH mechanisms in brain tissue, we developed a novel experimental platform featuring a specialized high-energy electron linear accelerator, High Intensity Gamma Ray Source (HIGS), paired with an organotypic ex vivo brain metastasis model. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We varied interpulse spacing to modulate the mean dose rate (MDR) of our unique 35 MeV electron beam, while maintaining extremely high instantaneous dose rate (IDR). We characterized dosimetry and targeting accuracy of the FLASH beam with film dosimetry. We combined this FLASH beam with an organotypic rat brain slice/breast carcinoma coculture model of brain metastasis to assess effects on normal and neoplastic tissues. Live-cell and bioluminescence imaging demonstrated cancer cell growth effects, whereas normal tissue responses and immune activation were assessed using live-cell imaging, cytokine profiles, and confocal microscopy. We performed comparison experiments with 20 MeV electrons from a Varian clinical linear accelerator (VCLA) using conventional dose rates. RESULTS: The highest IDR of the FLASH beam to date was 20.7 ± 0.6 MGy/s, with maximum MDR of 20.7 MGy/s delivered in 1 pulse of 1 µs duration. Beam targeting was accurate to <1 mm and reproducible. HIGS-FLASH and VCLA dose rates equivalently decreased cancer cell growth. HIGS-FLASH irradiation significantly increased tumor necrosis factor α and fractalkine levels and confocal microscopy revealed distinct changes in microglial morphology slices suggesting microglia activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel experimental platform produces extremely high dose rates and rapid normal/neoplastic tissue readouts for mechanistic research into the effects of FLASH radiation in the brain. HIGS-FLASH irradiation induces comparable cancer cell growth inhibition but differential effects on cytokines and microglial morphology, suggesting that acute innate immune responses may be involved in FLASH normal tissue effects in the brain.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the adequate contrast enhancement (CE) evaluation depending on concentration, volume, and rate of administration of contrast media (CM) and the scan parameters in equine contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT). OBJECTIVES: To investigate CE of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) and veins depending on the computed tomography (CT) voltage and concentration, volume, and rate of CM administration during intra-arterial CECT of equine distal forelimbs. STUDY DESIGN: In vivo experiments. METHODS: Six horses underwent 54 CT scans. First, the CE of DDFT and veins was evaluated depending on the voltage (80 kV and 250 mA or 120 kV and 150 mA) and CM concentration (150, 120, or 90 mg I/mL in 50 mL of CM). Second, CE of DDFT and veins was evaluated depending on the CM volume (50, 100, or 150 mL) and administration rate (2, 4, or 6 mL/s) with a fixed iodine delivery rate (IDR; 300 or 180 mg I/s). RESULTS: Contrast enhancement of DDFT was significantly higher at 80 kV of voltage and 150 mg I/mL of CM concentration (Median: 29.65; IQR: 1.74; p < 0.05). CE of the DDFT positively correlated with CM concentration (p < 0.001; r = 0.75). At 180 mg I/s IDR, contrast attenuation in the medial and lateral palmar veins significantly decreased at a CM of 30 mg I/mL, rate of 6 mL/s, and volume of 150 mL (median and IQR: 985.93 and 71.8 Hounsfield units [HU] and 988.73 and 41.16 HU, respectively); the CE was sufficient to distinguish between the vessels and the adjacent structures. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The number of animals was small. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a low CM concentration could yield sufficient CE of the DDFT and arteries with adjusted CT scanning parameters or volume and injection rate of CM. HINTERGRUND: Nur wenige Studien haben die adäquate Bewertung der Kontrastverstärkung (CE) in Abhängigkeit von der Konzentration, dem Volumen und der Rate des Kontrastmittels (CM) und den Scan‐Parametern in der kontrastverstärkten Computertomographie (CECT) bei Pferden untersucht. ZIEL DER STUDIE: Wir untersuchten die CE der tiefen Beugesehne (DDFT) und der Venen in Abhängigkeit von der CT‐Spannung und der Konzentration, dem Volumen und der Rate des CM während der intra‐arteriellen CECT an den distalen Vorderbeinen von Pferden. STUDIENDESIGN: In‐vivo Studie. METHODIK: Sechs Pferde wurden vierundfünfzig CT‐Scans unterzogen. Zunächst wurde die CE von DDFT und Venen in Abhängigkeit von der Spannung (80 kV und 250 mA oder 120 kV und 150 mA) und der CM‐Konzentration (150, 120 oder 90 mg I/mL in 50 mL CM) bewertet. Zweitens wurde die CE von DDFT und Venen in Abhängigkeit vom CM‐Volumen (50, 100 oder 150 mL) und der Verabreichungsrate (2, 4 oder 6 mL/s) mit einer festen Jodverabreichungsrate (IDR; 300 oder 180 mg I/s) bewertet. ERGEBNISSE: Die CE der DDFT war bei einer Spannung von 80 kV und einer CM‐Konzentration von 150 mg I/ml signifikant höher (Median: 29,65; IQR: 1,74; p < 0.05). Die CE der DDFT korrelierte positiv mit der CM‐Konzentration (p < 0.001; r = 0,75). Bei 180 mg I/s IDR nahm die Kontrastmittelabschwächung in den medialen und lateralen Palmarvenen bei einer CM von 30 mg I/mL, einer Rate von 6 mL/s und einem Volumen von 150 mL signifikant ab (Median und IQR: 985,93 und 71,8 Hounsfield‐Einheiten [HU] bzw. 988,73 und 41,16 HU); die CE reichte aus, um zwischen den Gefäßen und den angrenzenden Strukturen zu unterscheiden. HAUPTEINSCHRÄNKUNGEN: Die Anzahl der Tiere war gering. SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Unsere Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass eine niedrige CM‐Konzentration mit angepassten CT‐Scan‐Parametern bzw. CM‐Volumen und ‐Injektionsrate eine ausreichende CE der DDFT und Arterien ergeben könnte.

ABSTRACT:
Adolescence is a window of heightened vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of binge ethanol exposure. Adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure has been shown to induce long-lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments in patients and rodent models that increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). Our previous work shows that these behavioral deficits coincide with persistent dysfunction of astrocytes. Here, we aim to understand how astrocyte-synaptic structural and functional crosstalk are disrupted following AIE to provide better mechanistic understanding of why behavioral impairments persist into adulthood. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received AIE, a variety of adeno-associated viruses encoding astrocyte-specific sensors, and fiber implantation in the dorsal hippocampal (dHipp) for in vivo photometry. A subset of rats received hM3D(Gq) to chemogenetically activate astrocytes. Following AIE and a forced abstinence period that allowed growth into adulthood, rats underwent assessment in the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task with simultaneous fiber photometry recordings. By combining immunohistochemistry (IHC), Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and slice physiology, we show that AIE induces structural and functional decoupling of astrocytes from synapses and astrocyte dysregulation that persists into adulthood. Remarkably, stimulating astrocytic calcium signaling via chemogenetic activation attenuates heightened fear responding and restores gliotransmitter availability. These findings highlight a critical role for astrocyte-synaptic crosstalk in regulating fear learning and underscore the untapped therapeutic potential of targeting astrocytes to improve behavioral outcomes following substance use.

TITLE: Dermal exposure and surface contamination associated with the use of a cobalt-chrome alloy during additive manufacturing.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Amidst the rapidly emerging additive manufacturing (AM) industry, not enough attention has been given to dermal exposure, with only one previous study that assessed dermal exposure to metals. Our study aimed to characterise a cobalt (Co)-chrome (Cr) alloy feedstock powder (CO-538) in terms of particle size, shape, and elemental composition, and assess dermal exposure and workplace surface contamination during powder bed fusion AM. METHODS: Particle size distribution (PSD) and shape of the virgin and used feedstock powder were determined using static image and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The elemental composition of powders was established using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. A removal wipe sampling method using Ghostwipes was performed on AM operators' skin at various locations (index finger, palm, wrist, back of the hand, and neck), before and after each AM processing phase. Workplace surfaces (both AM and non-AM areas) were also sampled before and after each shift using a removal wipe method to measure surface contamination. RESULTS: PSD analysis revealed a significant difference (P ≤ 0.05) in median size, with used powder exhibiting smaller particles than virgin, where 10% of particles were smaller than the given diameter. Additionally, significant differences (P ≤ 0.05) were noted in the mean circularity and convexity between virgin and used powders, indicating that used powder particles were more irregular and rougher compared to virgin. The CO-538 feedstock powder contained Co, Cr, molybdenum (Mo), aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), and Ni. These metals were also detected on the skin of AM operators and on surfaces within the AM and non-AM areas of the facility. Dermal exposure occurred on all of the anatomical areas, with the highest total metal concentration detected on the index finger during the post-processing phase of AM. The highest full-shift geometric mean GM concentration of each metal was detected on the finger and followed a trend of Co > Cr > Fe > Al > Mo > Ni. Surface contamination occurred on all AM and non-AM sampling areas after a full shift. CONCLUSIONS: Dermal exposure to all CO-538 alloy metal constituents occurred on all sampled anatomical areas during all three processing phases. Measurable concentrations of metals that were detected on all sampled surfaces indicate that cross-contamination between AM and non-AM areas occurs and that these surfaces may act as a secondary source of exposure. There is thus a need for control measures to be implemented in AM facilities to eliminate or reduce surface metal contamination and dermal exposure.

ABSTRACT:
Multifocal Structured Illumination Microscopy (MSIM) was initially introduced as a parallel version of image scanning microscopy, aiming to enhance the temporal resolution of the imaging process. Beyond its capacity in super-resolution imaging, MSIM exhibits optical sectioning capabilities akin to confocal microscopy, making it well-suited for imaging thick tissue samples. Traditional MSIM reconstruction algorithms rely on digital pinholes to eliminate out-of-focus signals, demanding precise illumination information. However, controlling and accurately reconstructing illumination patterns can be challenging or impractical in certain experimental settings. To address this, our paper proposes a blind reconstruction method for MSIM that circumvents the need for exact illumination information. Leveraging the stability of the standard deviation for each pixel in illumination, this method achieves optical sectioning effectively and provides approximately 1.76 times better resolution than widefield imaging. The efficacy of our proposed blind reconstruction method for both super-resolution imaging and optical sectioning is validated through both simulations and experimental results.

ABSTRACT:
The study of helminth parasites has been carried out using different microscopy tools such as bright-field, fluorescence, confocal, and electron microcopies, providing morphological and ultrastructural information, which are important for morphological taxonomy. However, these microscopy techniques are unable to visualize both surface and internal structures simultaneously at high resolution in a single analysis. Consequently, researchers must use different tools to enhance the knowledge of helminths and other parasites. The present work highlights the importance of using a fluorescence stereomicroscopy based in the structured illumination to visualize simultaneously the surface and internal structures of helminth and other metazoan samples. Our results using a single equipment showed the surface topography and internal structures of the whole parasite simultaneously. In addition, the series of images can be applied to produce a three-dimensional (3D) model of the samples. These advanced methods can indeed open new frontiers for obtaining better morphological data, enriching the knowledge in helminthology, and enhancing studies of other invertebrates, especially where thick samples, which are common, are present. Recent studies with large and thick helminths have provided 2D and 3D visualization of the whole parasite. This represents an important advance in the investigation of helminth parasitology, invertebrate morphophysiology, and other areas of microanatomy study in metazoans.

ABSTRACT:
INTRODUCTION: Pathogenic variants in PKP2 are the most common cause of familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). OBJECTIVE: To test whether PKP2 deficiency only in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to provoke premature aging and pro-inflammatory senescence in non-myocytes, cardiac resident cells. METHODS: We studied mice with cardiomyocyte-specific, tamoxifen-activated loss of PKP2 (PKP2cKO) using conventional and multiplex imaging, cytokine arrays, epigenetic clocks, spatial transcriptomics, expansion and structured illumination microscopy, and correlative data analysis. We examined non-myocytes and cardiomyocytes for premature aging and senescence. RESULTS: We observed senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) and p21 staining in non-myocytes. Cytokines in media of non-myocyte cells were consistent with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Epigenetic clocks identified premature aging. Multiplex immunohistochemistry showed non-myocyte cells in niches, intermingled with cardiomyocytes. Spatial transcriptomics showed over-representation of SASP-related transcripts, predominantly in myocyte-rich areas of the left ventricle. SAHFs, p21 staining and increased epigenetic age were not found in cardiomyocytes from PKP2cKO hearts, though we observed structural features associated to premature aging. Cross-reference analysis showed correlation between the PKP2cKO cardiac proteome and that of mice 5 or 6 times their chronological age, as well as transcriptional signatures of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: Loss of PKP2 expression only in adult cardiac myocytes is sufficient to induce pro-inflammatory senescence in non-myocytes, and overall premature cardiac aging. This is the first study to intersect cellular senescence and premature aging in desmosomal arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. We speculate that cell-agnostic molecular signatures, biomarkers, and pharmacology of senescence and of neurodegenerative diseases may be relevant to diagnose or treat PKP2-ARVC. UNSTRUCTURED ABSTRACT: Pathogenic variants in PKP2 are the most common cause of familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. We used the PKP2cKO model (cardiomyocyte-specific, tamoxifen-activated PKP2 knockout) to examine whether PKP2 deficiency only in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to provoke premature aging and pro-inflammatory senescence in non-myocyte, cardiac resident cells. Through a variety of methods, we identified senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs), p21 staining, and cytokines consistent with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in cells and media of non-myocytes. Epigenetic clocks identified premature aging. Spatial transcriptomics showed over-representation of SASP-related transcripts, predominantly in myocyte-rich areas of the left ventricle. SAHFs, p21 staining and epigenetics suggesting advanced age were not found in cardiomyocytes, though we observed structural features associated to premature aging. Cross-reference analysis showed correlation between the PKP2cKO cardiac proteome and that of mice 5 or 6 times their chronological age, as well as transcriptional signatures of neurodegenerative diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: PKP2-ARVC is a leading cause of sudden unexpected death in the young.The molecular path from the variant of a gene to the clinical disease remains unclear. An inflammatory component has been postulated.We show that loss of PKP2 only in myocytes is sufficient to induce a pro-inflammatory senescence in non-myocytes and premature aging of cardiac cells.Similarities to the molecular profile of neurodegenerative diseases and novel paths to therapy are discussed.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enables visualization of cytoskeletal architecture at nanoscale, uncovering ultrastructural details obscured in conventional imaging. In this study, we present a quantitative framework for characterizing microtubule continuity and integrity based on SMLM super-resolution imaging. We first applied this approach to evaluate the effects of various chemical fixation protocols on microtubule structural preservation. While conventional immunofluorescence imaging suggested intact microtubules after paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation, SMLM revealed substantial fragmentation. To address this, we developed a computational algorithm that quantifies microtubule fragmentation using a defined fragmentation index (FI). Under identical 30-min fixation, quantitative analysis revealed a fragmentation hierarchy: 4% PFA > methanol > 1% glutaraldehyde (GA) ≈ 3% PFA + 0.1% GA, with the PFA-GA combination offering superior structural integrity and minimal background noise. Although prolonged PFA fixation improved preservation, it remained inferior to PFA-GA co-fixation. Notably, even a 10-min PFA-GA treatment was sufficient for effective stabilization. We further applied our framework to quantify microtubule length index (LI) in nocodazole-treated cells, revealing a drug-specific, dose-dependent microtubule disassembly. Together, we develop a quantitative pipeline based on SMLM, which establishes PFA-GA co-fixation as an optimal protocol for microtubule imaging and provides a scalable tool for super-resolution-based pharmacological screening.

ABSTRACT:
To fertilize an oocyte, mammalian spermatozoa must undergo a maturation step known as capacitation that takes place after ejaculation. Protein kinase A (PKA) plays a fundamental role in capacitation in all mammalian species. Before capacitation, PKA is maintained in an inactive state where the catalytic subunits are bound to a dimer of inhibitory regulatory subunits. A key element in the regulation of PKA lies in its intracellular compartmentalization achieved by docking at A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP). Despite the crucial role of the modulation of local PKA activity in fertilization, its localization and mechanism of compartmentalization are not well understood. Here, we approach this problem using quantitative laser scanning microscopy and superresolution imaging to dissect the interactions and relocalization of PKA subunits during capacitation. We find that in the resting state, both catalytic and regulatory subunits colocalize close to the axoneme. Upon capacitation, the PKA regulatory subunits, but not the catalytic subunits, relocate to a quadrilateral structure along the flagellum principal piece, in the vicinity of AKAP4 and the CatSper channel signaling complex. Furthermore, this quadrilateral localization of PKA regulatory subunits disappears in sperm from CatSper1 knockout mice. The sharp difference between the localization of PKA regulatory subunits in capacitated vs. noncapacitated sperm cells demonstrates its suitability as a biomarker for identifying capacitation, an enduring problem in the study of sperm physiology.

ABSTRACT:
DNA computing circuits leverage molecular interactions to construct a highly parallel and biologically compatible information processing paradigm. However, their development has been constrained by a critical gap between intrinsic computational parallelism and the limited readout bandwidth. Multibit outputs from complex circuits often require multiple separate tests, limiting the integration and debugging efficiency. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by decoupling computation from readout via a DNA origami display-based interface by integrating strand displacement and unstable binding reactions. We convert multibit molecular outputs from DNA circuits into spatially resolved geometric bits, enabling direct visualization via superresolution microscopy for high-throughput readout. We experimentally demonstrated the direct readout of an 8-bit decoder circuit and simultaneous display of 16 parallel-running logic gates. This high-bandwidth platform unlocks capabilities in circuit debugging and multiplexed execution, paving the way for large-scale DNA computing and high-throughput biosensing.

ABSTRACT:
Primary cilia are essential sensory organelles whose structural complexity has challenged detailed imaging analysis. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) offers a promising approach by physically enlarging specimens in hydrogels, enabling nanoscale protein mapping. Here, we apply U-ExM to pancreatic islet cilia and demonstrate the conserved presence of all four axonemal dynein subtypes, including prominent localization of the intermediate chain DNAI1 in both primary cilia and centrioles. These findings suggest that U-ExM is a robust tool for ciliary studies and provide evidence that primary cilia may possess motor capabilities that could reshape our understanding of their function.

ABSTRACT:
Primary cilia are vital sensory organelles whose structures are challenging to study due to their solitary nature and intricate cytoskeleton. Current imaging modalities are limited in their ability to visualize structural details that are important for understanding primary cilia function. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) is a recent superresolution imaging technique that physically expands biological specimens using a swellable hydrogel, allowing structural interrogation of small cellular components such as cilia. In this study, we apply U-ExM to mouse and human pancreatic islets to visualize the axonemal cytoskeleton and associated proteins in primary cilia. Our study reveals the expression of axonemal dynein in islet primary cilia and centrioles, with DNAI1 being a principal subunit which we validate using targeted shRNA knockdown. We conclude that U-ExM is suitable for localizing protein expression in pancreatic islet cilia which contain axonemal dynein.

TITLE: Ultrastructural expansion microscopy reveals unexpected levels of glycosome heterogeneity in African trypanosomes.
AUTHORS: Anderson Heidi, Powell Rhonda Reigers, Morris Meredith Teilhet
JOURNAL: Journal of microscopy (2025)
PMID: 40742527
DOI: 10.1111/jmi.70019

ABSTRACT:
Kinetoplastid parasites include several species. Trypanosoma brucei causes African sleeping sickness in humans and a wasting disease nagana in livestock. Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease and Leishmania species cause leishmaniasis, which can present with visceral, cutaneous, or mucocutaneous symptoms. All kinetoplastids harbour specialised peroxisomes called glycosomes, so named because most of the glycolytic pathway that is cytosolic in other eukaryotes is localised to these organelles. Glycosomes lack DNA and are essential for parasite viability. Despite their name, glycosomes also house enzymes involved in diverse pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway, ether lipid biosynthesis, purine salvage, and sugar nucleotide biosynthesis. The degree to which these biochemical pathways localise together within the same organelle or to different glycosome populations is unclear. Biochemical fractionations and imaging data strongly suggest that glycosomes are heterogeneous in composition and that even within a single parasite, there are different glycosome populations. Until recently, we lacked the technology to systematically characterise glycosome populations within parasites. Glycosome morphology, composition, and localisation have historically been studied using widefield fluorescence and electron microscopy (EM). While EM can resolve individual organelles, it is extremely low throughput and requires specialised expertise and equipment. Widefield fluorescence imaging is higher throughput and more accessible. However, the small size of T. brucei cells, which are ∼20 µM in length and 3-5 µM in width, and glycosomes (100 nm in diameter) place these organelles below the resolution limits of standard microscopy and require super-resolution techniques to be resolved. These resolution issues are compounded by the cytoplasm's crowded nature, making it hard to discern individual organelles from each other. To overcome this, we leveraged recent advances in super-resolution microscopy, including a method called Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM) combined with confocal imaging and LIGHTNING™ deconvolution to optimise the resolution of individual glycosomes. We found that antibodies against two different glycosome marker proteins (aldolase and GAPDH) exhibit discrete staining patterns. This high-resolution approach also revealed that glycosome morphology varies between monomorphic parasites that cannot complete the lifecycle and pleomorphic parasites that can, and is dynamically influenced by extracellular conditions, such as glucose availability, underscoring the adaptability of T. brucei's compartmentalisation to environmental changes.

ABSTRACT:
Cellular structure self-organizes through an interplay between internal mechanisms and external cues. In predatory ciliates, structures that capture prey obtain the resources needed for their construction, creating feedback between environmental inputs and morphological outputs. Here, we describe a self-organizing single-cell morphology circuit that adaptively optimizes the predatory trap structure of the suctorian Podophrya collini . These trap structures ensnare large cellular targets using an array of straw-like tentacles that siphon out prey cytoplasm upon contact with their tips. We find that trap architecture scales anisotropically, favoring tentacle number over length, to construct traps that maximize capture probability for the resources on hand. Drug perturbations, transcriptomics, proteomics, and expansion microscopy define distinct molecular and structural requirements that regulate trap structure maintenance and tentacle biogenesis. We integrate these findings into a mathematical model that explains the adaptive scaling of the trap and that makes predictions we confirm experimentally. More broadly, this circuit's architecture provides a general-purpose control logic for organizing the number and size of sub-cellular structures applicable to other natural and engineered cellular systems.

ABSTRACT:
Cells reorganize in space and time to move and divide - complex behaviors driven by their internal cytoskeleton. While we have substantial knowledge of the molecular parts and rules of cytoskeletal assembly, we know less about how structures are remodeled, for example to interconvert centrioles from the ciliary base to the centrosome. To study this in an evolutionary context we use the chytrid fungus, Rhizoclosmatium globosum , a member of the zoosporic fungi which have centrioles and cilia, lost in other fungal lineages. Chytrids undergo reorganization of their microtubule cytoskeleton as they cycle from zoospore to multinucleated coenocyte. We use comparative bioinformatics, RNA sequencing, and expansion microscopy to map the microtubule cytoskeleton over the chytrid lifecycle. We find that when zoospores encyst, cilia are retracted into the cytoplasm and degraded, and centrioles detach but are protected from degradation. A shortened proximal centriole then forms the mitotic centrosome and ultimately elongates to form cilia at the end of the mitotic cycles, driven by a conserved transcriptional program. Thus, structural remodeling of the chytrid centriole is coupled temporally to ciliated stages rather than mitotic cycles, which may serve as a mechanism to tune microtubule organization to meet the needs of different lifecycle stages.

ABSTRACT:
Meiosis is a conserved yet evolutionarily varied process underpinning sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium , meiosis is unconventional: it occurs immediately after fertilisation (post-zygotic) and must be coordinated with the transformation of the zygote into a motile ookinete. The mechanisms synchronising these meiotic and morphogenetic programmes remain unknow. Here, we identify the Plasmodium berghei NIMA-related kinase, NEK4 as a key regulator that couples meiotic initiation with zygote morphogenesis. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we show that NEK4 accumulates at the microtubule-organising centre (MTOC) and the apical polar complex (APC) shortly after fertilisation, preceding the assembly of perinuclear and cortical microtubules. We reveal that Plasmodium zygotes undergo a nuclear migration driven by the MTOC, analogous to the horsetail nuclear movement of fission yeast. Deletion of nek4 results in complete developmental arrest: MTOC duplication and microtubule formation are blocked, chromatin remains uncondensed, and nuclear migration and cell polarity fail to establish. Transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveal that NEK4 absence causes a collapse in transcriptional and phosphoregulatory networks governing meiosis and cytoskeletal organisation, leading to reduced expression and phosphorylation of important players, including HOP1, REC8, and AP2-O. These findings establish NEK4 as a key regulator driving meiotic entry and zygote maturation.

ABSTRACT:
CLARITY is a technique that makes tissues optically transparent, enabling the clear visualization of complex cellular and subcellular structures with relative ease. Traditionally, this technique has been used to visualize the pathologies of certain diseases. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the CLARITY technique of clearing lipids from tissues has enabled precise visualization of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies with a temporal analysis of the extent of protein aggregation associated with disease progression. This information has been invaluable for determining the progression of AD. Moreover, the structural characteristics of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles provide details about aggregation patterns. Here, we highlight critical insights into the potential applications of the CLARITY technique in conjunction with other modalities. We elucidated microscopy techniques, namely confocal microscopy and light-sheet microscopy, which are often used to detect fluorescently labeled compounds within cells, aiding in the qualitative and quantitative estimation of target proteins. Additionally, we discuss the application of super-resolution expansion microscopy (SREM) to increase the resolution of tissue images without compromising molecular specificity. We also expounded on the application of CLARITY-based imaging in improving optogenetics and organoid development. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of CLARITY in assisting the formulation and validation of machine learning algorithms and conducting hypothesis testing.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) has become an emerging optical biopsy method for in situ imaging and diagnosis, which aids in the accurate early diagnosis of diseases like inflammation and cancer. However, due to physical constraints induced by the fiber bundle used for signal acquisition, obtaining pCLE images of high resolution is challenging. Consequently, in this study, we aim to improve pCLE image quality through the implementation of advanced post-processing techniques. METHODS: Here we propose an unsupervised single image super-resolution framework, which is free of using high-resolution pCLE images as reference and improves image quality significantly. The framework consists of a degradation module, a style transformation module and a super resolution module. In the degradation module, we propose an innovative distribution assumption module to randomize the fiber optic position distribution, enabling us to simulate the imaging principles of pCLE and create synthetic pCLE images for training. RESULTS: With the integration of modules, both quantitative and qualitative analyses highlight the remarkable efficiency of our pipeline in super-resolving images compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our framework also demonstrates strong generalization capability, effectively mitigating the impact of pCLE system's intrinsic characteristics on image super-resolution. This feature is particularly advantageous as it allows the framework to circumvent redundant training when applied to various devices. CONCLUSIONS: With the outstanding super-resolution and generalization capability, our proposed methodology enables clearer observation of image details and more accurate localization of micro structures, which contributes to precise identification of lesion areas and diagnostic accuracy enhancement.

ABSTRACT:
INTRODUCTION: Kidney glomeruli have traditionally been studied by micrometer-scale optical microscopy to interrogate overall physiology or molecular distributions and by nanoscale electron microscopy to interrogate ultrastructure. However, these techniques are limited by their focus on thin sections and specific regions. This restricts their capacity to evaluate whole glomeruli as holistic 3D functional units. We lack a unified, spatially integrated view of the glomerulus as a whole system to better understand structural and cellular changes across different conditions. METHODS: We developed GloMAP (Glomerulus Mapping and Analysis Pipeline), a novel workflow that integrates tissue expansion, super-resolution optical microscopy, and computational reconstruction to generate high-resolution (about 100 nm) 3D models of entire mouse glomeruli. GloMAP integrates both manual and machine learning-assisted segmentation to precisely annotate and quantify glomerular structures, including compartmental volumes, surface areas, membrane thickness distribution, and cellular morphometric properties. RESULTS: Using GloMAP, we reconstructed and analyzed 24 glomeruli from healthy adult, aged, and model diseased mice. Our method enabled volumetric and spatial quantification of key compartments and distributions of four primary glomerular cell types. GloMAP revealed previously inaccessible features such as global membrane thickening patterns and compartmental shifts associated with aging and focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: The pipeline's compatibility with commonly available optical microscopes and its potential to integrate molecular labeling and other super-resolution techniques make it a scalable and versatile tool. GloMAP provides a scalable, accessible platform for comprehensive 3D structural and cellular analysis of whole glomeruli at 100 nm resolution. This integrative pipeline fills a critical gap between traditional light and electron microscopy and holds potential for broader application in translational nephrology research, offering new opportunities to identify structural biomarkers and pathophysiological mechanisms in kidney disease.

ABSTRACT:
Patients with brain tumors often suffer debilitating neurological dysfunction as their tumors disrupt brain tissue, affecting both local and global neural activity and blood flow. However, studying tumor-brain interactions in animal models is challenging due to a lack of methods that simultaneously capture dynamics of tumor growth, neural activity and vascular alterations over time. Here, we overcome this limitation using a multimodal ultrasound imaging platform, an imaging technique that offers brain-wide coverage in living animals at 10-100 µm resolution. To monitor the co-evolution of tumor growth, neural activity and vascular remodeling, we integrated (1) nonlinear imaging of acoustic reporter gene expressing-tumors, (2) hemodynamic functional imaging of brain activity, and (3) super-resolution microscopy of the vasculature. Integrating these modalities for the first time and applying them to a common model of glioblastoma, we followed tumor-brain interactions in individual animals over their disease lifetimes. Our approach allowed us to precisely map the spatial displacement of functional brain regions, the local and global disruption of functional connectivity, and the remodeling of the blood supply to support tumor growth. This integrated method bridges a critical gap in brain cancer research and therapy development by providing a unified dynamic view of what happens to the brain as tumors grow within it.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: The skin, as the largest organ of the body, plays a critical role in homeostasis and protecting against environmental stressors. Sebaceous glands (SGs) produce sebum, which forms a lipid barrier essential for preventing dehydration and defending against oxidative and microbial damage. However, ageing and environmental factors such as UV exposure and pollution impair SG function, leading to skin dryness and loss of radiance. Pterostilbene, a natural antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects, has not been extensively studied for its potential impact on ageing SG cells. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of pterostilbene on SG function under UV-induced damage and its role in collagen repair in UV-exposed fibroblasts. METHODS: To examine the effects of pterostilbene on UVA-induced damage, an in vitro model of UV-exposed sebocytes was developed. The influence of pterostilbene on lipid synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and gene expression related to senescence and inflammation was assessed. In parallel, the effects of pterostilbene on collagen synthesis (types I and III) and ROS levels in UV-exposed fibroblasts were analysed. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy was utilized to visualize collagen production and F-actin integrity in fibroblasts treated with pterostilbene. RESULTS: Pterostilbene increased lipid synthesis by 16% and reduced ROS levels by 62.43% in UV-damaged sebocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of antioxidant genes (Nrf2, Sirt6) and downregulation of differentiation-related genes (Blimp1, c-Myc). In UV-exposed fibroblasts, pterostilbene significantly enhanced collagen types I and III levels and reduced ROS by 40.07%. High-resolution microscopy showed that pterostilbene restored the distribution of F-actin in fibroblasts affected by UVA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that pterostilbene effectively protects against UVA-induced damage in both sebocytes and fibroblasts. By promoting lipid synthesis, reducing oxidative stress, and stimulating collagen production, pterostilbene presents a promising natural ingredient for anti-ageing skincare formulations. Its multifunctional mechanisms suggest its potential to enhance skin health by supporting sebaceous gland function and improving overall skin resilience. OBJECTIF: La peau est le plus grand organe du corps. Elle joue un rôle essentiel dans l'homéostasie et la protection contre les facteurs de stress environnementaux. Les glandes sébacées (GS) produisent du sébum, qui forme une barrière lipidique essentielle pour prévenir la déshydratation et se défendre contre les dommages oxydatifs et microbiens. Cependant, le vieillissement et les facteurs environnementaux tels que l'exposition aux UV et la pollution altèrent la fonction des GS, entraînant une sécheresse de la peau et une perte d'éclat. Le ptérostilbène, un antioxydant naturel aux effets anti‐inflammatoires, n'a pas fait l'objet d'études approfondies quant à son impact potentiel sur les cellules GS vieillissantes. Cette étude vise à examiner les effets protecteurs du ptérostilbène sur la fonction des GS en cas de dommages induits par les UV et son rôle dans la réparation du collagène dans les fibroblastes exposés aux UV. MÉTHODES: Pour examiner les effets du ptérostilbène sur les dommages induits par les UVA, un modèle in vitro de sébocytes exposés aux UV a été mis au point. L'influence du ptérostilbène sur la synthèse lipidique, les niveaux d'espèces réactives de l'oxygène (ROS) et l'expression génique liée à la sénescence et à l'inflammation a été évaluée. En parallèle, les effets du ptérostilbène sur la synthèse du collagène (types I et III) et les niveaux de ROS dans les fibroblastes exposés aux UV ont été analysés. La microscopie par fluorescence à super‐résolution a été utilisée pour visualiser la production de collagène et l'intégrité de l'actine F dans les fibroblastes traités par ptérostilbène. RÉSULTATS: Le ptérostilbène a augmenté la synthèse lipidique de 16% et réduit les niveaux de ROS de 62,43% dans les sébocytes endommagés par les UV. L'analyse de l'expression génique a révélé une augmentation des gènes antioxydants (Nrf2, Sirt6) et une diminution des gènes liés à la différenciation (Blimp1, c‐Myc). Dans les fibroblastes exposés aux UV, le ptérostilbène a augmenté de manière significative les niveaux de collagène de types I et III et réduit les ROS de 40,07%. La microscopie à haute résolution a montré que le ptérostilbène restaurait la distribution de l'actine F dans les fibroblastes affectés par les UVA. CONCLUSION: Cette étude démontre que le ptérostilbène protège efficacement les sébocytes et les fibroblastes contre les dommages induits par les UVA. En favorisant la synthèse lipidique, en réduisant le stress oxydatif et en stimulant la production de collagène, le ptérostilbène constitue un ingrédient naturel prometteur pour les formules de soins anti‐âge. Ses mécanismes multifonctionnels suggèrent qu'il peut améliorer la santé de la peau en soutenant la fonction des glandes sébacées et en améliorant la résilience globale de la peau.

One pivotal aspect of the impact of exercise lies in the systemic transcriptional response, which underpins its beneficial adaptations. Although extensive research has been devoted to understanding the transcriptional response to exercise, our knowledge of the protein constituents of nuclear processes accompanying gene expression in skeletal muscle remains largely elusive. We hypothesize that alterations in the nuclear proteome following exercise hold vital clues for comprehending exercise-induced transcriptional regulation and related nuclear functions. We first detail the successful isolation of skeletal muscle nuclei from C57BL/6 mice, encapsulating 2,030 proteins linked to nuclear processes such as transcription, RNA processing, chromatin modifications, and nuclear transport. We then used this approach to isolate muscle nuclei in sedentary, immediately post-, 1-h, and 4-h after a 30-min treadmill running session, to gain insight into the nuclear proteome after exercise. We found 54 proteins linked to mRNA splicing and nucleocytoplasmic transport, many of which were substantially reduced immediately postexercise followed by a rapid increase 1- and 4-h postexercise. Super-resolution microscopy experiments highlight localization changes in mRNA processing proteins postexercise, further suggesting changes in nuclear transport dynamics. Our data provide important insight into changes in the nuclear proteome following exercise. In particular, it highlights proteins contributing to mRNA processing and splicing in addition to transcriptional processes, with exercise offering broader changes in mechanisms modulating the molecular response to acute exercise.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Exercise plays a crucial role in promoting muscle health, but our understanding of nuclear proteins orchestrating the molecular response to exercise is limited. Isolation of skeletal muscle nuclei coupled with mass spectrometry enhanced the identification of nuclear proteins. This approach was used to investigate the temporal changes in the muscle nuclear proteome postexercise, including proteins linked to posttranscriptional processing and nuclear transport. Our findings offer new insights into potential mechanisms contributing to exercise-induced adaptations.

TITLE: Confocal Microscopy Analysis of Protein Sorting to Plasmodesmata in Nicotiana benthamiana.

ABSTRACT:
Plasmodesmata are membranous nanopores that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent plant cells and enable the cell-to-cell trafficking of nutrients, macromolecules, as well as invading viruses. Plasmodesmata play fundamental roles in the regulation of intercellular communication, contributing to plant development, environmental responses, and interactions with viral pathogens. Discovering plasmodesmal localization of plant or viral proteins could provide useful functional information about the protein and is important for understanding the mechanisms of plant-virus interactions. To facilitate these studies, we describe a protocol for confocal microscopy-based analysis of different plasmodesmal targeting proteins to select the best plasmodesmal marker for studying the virus-plasmodesmata interactions or plasmodesmal transport. Specifically, the analyses of these events are illustrated using the cell-to-cell movement protein (MP) of the Turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV), the Arabidopsis Plasmodesmata-Localized Protein 5 (PDLP5) and Plasmodesmata Callose-Binding Protein 1 (PDCB1). The protein plasmodesmal localization data are analyzed in parallel with the global visualization of plasmodesmata using aniline blue staining of the sampled tissues. These approaches can be easily adapted to analyze the plasmodesmal localization of any cellular or pathogen proteins in planta.

TITLE: MultiBac System-based Purification and Biophysical Characterization of Human Myosin-7a.
AUTHORS: Wright Marvin, Redford Shayna, Vehar Jacob, Courtney Kevin C, Billington Neil, Liu Rong

ABSTRACT:
Myosin-7a is an actin-based motor protein vital for auditory and visual processes. Mutations in myosin-7a lead to Usher syndrome type 1, the most common and severe form of deaf-blindness in humans. It is hypothesized that myosin-7a forms a transmembrane adhesion complex with other Usher proteins, essential for the structural-functional integrity of photoreceptor and cochlear hair cells. However, due to the challenges in obtaining pure, intact protein, the exact functional mechanisms of human myosin-7a remain elusive, with limited structural and biomechanical studies available. Recent studies have shown that mammalian myosin-7a is a multimeric motor complex consisting of a heavy chain and three types of light chains: regulatory light chain (RLC), calmodulin, and calmodulin-like protein 4 (CALML4). Unlike calmodulin, CALML4 does not bind to calcium ions. Both the calcium-sensitive, and insensitive calmodulins are critical for mammalian myosin-7a for proper fine-tuning of its mechanical properties. Here, we describe a detailed method to produce recombinant human myosin-7a holoenzyme using the MultiBac Baculovirus protein expression system. This yields milligram quantities of high-purity full-length protein, allowing for its biochemical and biophysical characterization. We further present a protocol for assessing its mechanical and motile properties using tailored in vitro motility assays and fluorescence microscopy. The availability of the intact human myosin-7a protein, along with the detailed functional characterization protocol described here, paves the way for further investigations into the molecular aspects of myosin-7a in vision and hearing.

ABSTRACT:
The autophagy-lysosomal pathway enables the controlled degradation of cellular contents. Nucleophagy is the selective autophagic recycling of nuclear components upon delivery to the lysosome. Although methods to monitor and quantify autophagy as well as selective types of autophagy have been developed and implemented in cells and in vivo, methods monitoring nucleophagy remain scarce. Here, we describe a procedure to monitor the autophagic engagement of an endogenous nuclear envelope component, i.e., ANC-1, the nematode homologue of the mammalian Nesprins in vivo, utilizing super-resolution microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution optical microscopy enables optical imaging of cells, molecules and other biological structures beyond the diffraction limit. However, no similar method exists to super-resolve specific cells with ultrasound. Here we introduce Deactivation Super Resolution (DSR), an ultrasound imaging method that uses the acoustic deactivation of genetically encodable contrast agents to super-resolve individual cells with ultrasound as they navigate through structures that cannot be resolved by conventional imaging methods. DSR takes advantage of gas vesicles, which are air-filled sub-micron protein particles that can be expressed in genetically engineered cells to produce ultrasound contrast. Our experimental results show that DSR can distinguish sub-wavelength microstructures that standard B-mode ultrasound images fail to resolve by super- localizing individual mammalian cells. This study provides a proof of concept for the potential of DSR to serve as a super- resolution ultrasound technique for individual cell localization, opening new horizons in the field.

ABSTRACT:
Endo-lysosomes are considered acidic Ca 2+ stores but direct measurements of luminal Ca 2+ within them are limited. Here we report that the Ca 2+ -sensitive luminescent protein aequorin does not reconstitute with its cofactor at highly acidic pH but that a significant fraction of the probe is functional within a mildly acidic compartment when targeted to the endo-lysosomal system. We leveraged this probe (ELGA) to report Ca 2+ dynamics in this compartment. We show that Ca 2+ uptake is ATP-dependent and sensitive to blockers of endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ pumps. We find that the Ca 2+ mobilizing messenger IP 3 which typically targets the endoplasmic reticulum evokes robust luminal responses in wild type cells, but not in IP 3 receptor knock-out cells. Responses were comparable to those evoked by activation of the endo-lysosomal ion channel TRPML1. Stimulation with IP 3 -forming agonists also mobilized the store in intact cells. Super-resolution microscopy analysis confirmed the presence of IP 3 receptors within the endo-lysosomal system, both in live and fixed cells. Our data reveal a physiologically-relevant, IP 3 -sensitive store of Ca 2+ within the endo-lysosomal system.

ABSTRACT:
Mammalian cells are frequently exposed to mechanical and biochemical stressors resulting in plasma membrane injuries. Repair mechanisms reseal the plasma membrane to restore homeostasis and prevent cell death. In the present work, a silencing RNA screen was performed to uncover plasma membrane repair mechanisms of cells exposed to a pore-forming toxin (listeriolysin O). This screen identified molecules previously known to repair the injured plasma membrane such as annexin A2 (ANXA2) as well as novel plasma membrane repair candidate proteins. Of the novel candidates, we focused on septin 7 (SEPT7) because the septins are an important family of conserved eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins. Using diverse experimental approaches, we established for the first time that SEPT7 plays a general role in plasma membrane repair of cells perforated by pore-forming toxins and mechanical wounding. Remarkably, upon cell injury, the septin cytoskeleton is extensively redistributed in a Ca 2+ -dependent fashion, a hallmark of plasma membrane repair machineries. The septins reorganize into subplasmalemmal domains arranged as knob and loop (or ring) structures containing F-actin, myosin II, and annexin A2 (ANXA2) and protrude from the cell surface. Importantly, the formation of these domains correlates with the plasma membrane repair efficiency. Super-resolution microscopy shows that septins and actin are arranged in intertwined filaments associated with ANXA2. Silencing SEPT7 expression prevented the formation of the F-actin/myosin II/ANXA2 domains, however, silencing expression of ANXA2 had no observable effect on their formation. These results highlight the key structural role of the septins in remodeling the plasma membrane and in the recruitment of the repair molecule ANXA2. Collectively, our data support a novel model in which the septin cytoskeleton acts as a scaffold to promote the formation of plasma membrane repair domains containing contractile F-actin and annexin A2.

ABSTRACT:
Neural tube closure (NTC) is a critical process during embryonic development. Failure in this process can lead to neural tube defects, causing congenital malformations or even mortality. NTC involves a series of mechanisms on genetic, molecular, and mechanical levels. While mechanical regulation has become an increasingly attractive topic in recent years, it remains largely unexplored due to the lack of suitable technology for conducting mechanical testing of 3D embryonic tissue in situ. In response, we have developed a protocol for quantifying the mechanical properties of chicken embryonic tissue in a non-contact and non-invasive manner. This is achieved by integrating a confocal Brillouin microscope with an on-stage incubation system. To probe tissue mechanics, a pre-cultured embryo is collected and transferred to an on-stage incubator for ex ovo culture. Simultaneously, the mechanical images of the neural plate tissue are acquired by the Brillouin microscope at different time points during development. This protocol includes detailed descriptions of sample preparation, the implementation of Brillouin microscopy experiments, and data post-processing and analysis. By following this protocol, researchers can study the mechanical evolution of embryonic tissue during development longitudinally.

ABSTRACT:
The physiology and pathophysiology of the pancreas are complex. Diseases of the pancreas, such as pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have high morbidity and mortality. Intravital imaging (IVI) is a powerful technique enabling the high-resolution imaging of tissues in both healthy and diseased states, allowing for real-time observation of cell dynamics. IVI of the murine pancreas presents significant challenges due to the deep visceral and compliant nature of the organ, which make it highly prone to damage and motion artifacts. Described here is the process of implantation of the Stabilized Window for Intravital imaging of the murine Pancreas (SWIP). The SWIP allows IVI of the murine pancreas in normal healthy states, during the transformation from the healthy pancreas to acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein, and in malignant states such as pancreatic tumors. In conjunction with genetically labeled cells or the administration of fluorescent dyes, the SWIP enables the measurement of single-cell and subcellular dynamics (including single-cell and collective migration) as well as serial imaging of the same region of interest over multiple days. The ability to capture tumor cell migration is of particular importance as the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in PDAC is the overwhelming metastatic burden. Understanding the physiological dynamics of metastasis in PDAC is a critical unmet need and crucial for improving patient prognosis. Overall, the SWIP provides improved imaging stability and expands the application of IVI in the healthy pancreas and malignant pancreas diseases.

ABSTRACT:
The continuously growing mouse incisor is emerging as a highly tractable model system to investigate the regulation of adult epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells and tooth regeneration. These progenitor populations actively divide, move, and differentiate to maintain tissue homeostasis and regenerate lost cells in a responsive manner. However, traditional analyses using fixed tissue sections could not capture the dynamic processes of cellular movements and interactions, limiting our ability to study their regulations. This paper describes a protocol to maintain whole mouse incisors in an explant culture system and live-track dental epithelial cells using multiphoton timelapse microscopy. This technique adds to our existing toolbox for dental research and allows investigators to acquire spatiotemporal information on cell behaviors and organizations in a living tissue. We anticipate that this methodology will help researchers further explore mechanisms that control the dynamic cellular processes taking place during both dental renewal and regeneration.

ABSTRACT:
Microtubules, polymers of α, β-tubulin heterodimers, are organized into multi-microtubule arrays for diverse cellular functions. The dynamic properties of microtubule arrays govern their structural and functional properties. While numerous insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying microtubule organization have been gleaned from in vitro reconstitution studies, the assays are largely restricted to visualization of single or pairs of microtubules. Thus, the dynamic processes underlying the remodeling of multi-microtubule arrays remain poorly understood. Recent work shows that Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables the visualization of nanoscale dynamics within multi-microtubule 2D arrays. In this assay, electrostatic interactions permit the non-specific adsorption of microtubule arrays to mica. AFM imaging in tapping mode, a gentle method of imaging, allows the visualization of microtubules and protofilaments without sample damage. The height information captured by AFM imaging enables the tracking of structural changes in microtubules and protofilaments within multi-microtubule arrays over time. The experimental data from the method described here reveal previously unseen modes of nanoscale dynamics in microtubule bundles formed by the microtubule-crosslinking protein PRC1 in the presence of the depolymerase MCAK. The observations demonstrate the potential of AFM imaging in transforming our understanding of the fundamental cellular process by which multi-microtubule arrays are dynamically assembled and disassembled. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
We study the potential of the commercial mounting medium Slowfade diamond as a buffer for STORM microscopy. We show that although it does not work with the popular far-red dyes typically used for STORM imaging, such as Alexa Fluor 647, it performs really well with a wide variety of green-excited dyes such as Alexa Fluor 532, Alexa Fluor 555 or CF 568. Moreover, imaging can be performed several months after the samples are mounted in this environment and kept in the fridge, providing a convenient way to preserve samples for STORM imaging, as well as to keep calibration samples, for example for metrology or teaching in particular in imaging facilities.

ABSTRACT:
Immunofluorescence is a technique that uses antibodies and fluorophores to label structures inside cells. The cells are normally fixed and permeabilized, and then structures are labelled using primary antibodies directly conjugated to fluorophores, or, more commonly, first with an antibody against an antigen of interest followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore that binds to the primary antibody. Fluorescence can be visualized using widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy. Here we focus on labelling of the Golgi apparatus and show that different fixation and permeabilization conditions can significantly affect labelling of Golgi proteins and describe how to optimize fluorescent detection of Golgi proteins.

ABSTRACT:
In this work we report a gelatin-based, simple two-steps approach for fabrication of reduced graphene oxide (rGO-GEL) possessing high stability and biocompatibility, as novel label-free intracellular contrast agents. Gelatin, a biopolymer that is known for its versatility, was employed not only to biocompatibilize the rGO, but also to prevent the aggregation of the GO nanosheets during the reduction process. To confirm the successful reduction process and the attachment of the gelatin to the rGO nanosheets, we employed multiple spectroscopic analyses such as FT-IR, Raman, UV-VIS and photoluminescence, while the morphology and the lateral dimensions of the resulting hybrid rGO-GEL were investigated by Scanning-Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). Cellular toxicity test proved that the rGO-GEL nanoflakes are nontoxic for melanoma B16-F10 cells, even at high concentrations. Finally, the intracellular tracking after 24 h of treatment was performed by non-invasive Super-resolution re-scan confocal microscopy as well as Confocal Raman imaging, thus implementing our nanoflakes as a suitable contrast agent candidate for cellular imaging of interest.

ABSTRACT:
In this study, we present a detailed protocol for live imaging and quantitative analysis of floral meristem development in Aquilegia coerulea, a member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). Using confocal microscopy and the image analysis software MorphoGraphX, we were able to examine the cellular growth dynamics during floral organ primordia initiation, and the transition from floral meristem proliferation to termination. This protocol provides a powerful tool to study the development of the meristem and floral organ primordia, and should be easily adaptable to many plant lineages, including other emerging model systems. It will allow researchers to explore questions outside the scope of common model systems.

ABSTRACT:
The ribosome is a complex cellular machinery whose solved structure allowed for an incredible leap in structural biology research. Different ions bind to the ribosome, stabilizing inter-subunit interfaces and structurally linking rRNAs, proteins, and ligands. Besides cations such as K + and Mg 2+ , polyamines are known to stabilize the folding of RNA and overall structure. The bacterial ribosome is composed of a small (30S) subunit containing the decoding center and a large (50S) subunit devoted to peptide bond formation. We have previously shown that the small ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus is sensitive to changes in ionic conditions and polyamines concentration. In particular, its decoding center, where mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons interact, is prone to structural deformations in the absence of spermidine. Here, we report a detailed protocol for the purification of the intact and functional 30S, achieved through specific ionic conditions and the addition of spermidine. Using this protocol, we obtained the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the 30S-mRNA complex from S. aureus at 3.6 Å resolution. The 30S-mRNA complex formation was verified by a toeprinting assay. In this article, we also include a description of toeprinting and cryo-EM protocols. The described protocols can be further used to study the process of translation regulation. Graphical abstract.

ABSTRACT:
Dozens of Mycoplasma species belonging to the class Mollicutes bind to solid surfaces through the organelle formed at a cell pole and glide in its direction by a unique mechanism. In Mycoplasma mobile, the fastest gliding species in Mycoplasma, the force for gliding is generated by ATP hydrolysis on an internal structure. However, the spatial and temporal behaviors of the internal structures in living cells were unclear. High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) is a powerful method to monitor the dynamic behaviors of biomolecules and cells that can be captured while maintaining their active state in aqueous solution. In this protocol, we describe a method to detect their movements using HS-AFM. This protocol should be useful for the studies of many kinds of microorganisms.

ABSTRACT:
Microorganisms have evolved adaptive strategies to respond to the autonomous degradation of their environment. Indeed, a growing culture progressively exhausts nutrients from its media and modifies its composition. Yet, how single cells react to these modifications remains difficult to study since it requires population-scale growth experiments to allow cell proliferation to have a collective impact on the environment, while monitoring the same individuals exposed to this environment for days. For this purpose, we have previously described an integrated microfluidic pipeline, based on continuous separation of the cells from the media and subsequent perfusion of the filtered media in an observation chamber containing isolated single cells. Here, we provide a detailed protocol to implement this methodology, including the setting up of the microfluidic system and the processing of timelapse images.

TITLE: Labeling Endogenous Proteins Using CRISPR-mediated Insertion of Exon (CRISPIE).

ABSTRACT:
The CRISPR/Cas9 technology has transformed our ability to edit eukaryotic genomes. Despite this breakthrough, it remains challenging to precisely knock-in large DNA sequences, such as those encoding a fluorescent protein, for labeling or modifying a target protein in post-mitotic cells. Previous efforts focusing on sequence insertion to the protein coding sequence often suffer from insertions/deletions (INDELs) resulting from the efficient non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ). To overcome this limitation, we have developed CRISPR-mediated insertion of exon (CRISPIE). CRISPIE circumvents INDELs and other editing errors by inserting a designer exon flanked by adjacent intron sequences into an appropriate intronic location of the targeted gene. Because INDELs at the insertion junction can be spliced out, "CRISPIEd" genes produce precisely edited mRNA transcripts that are virtually error-free. In part due to the elimination of INDELs, high-efficiency labeling can be achieved in vivo. CRISPIE is compatible with both N- and C-terminal labels, and with all common transfection methods. Importantly, CRISPIE allows for later removal of the protein modification by including exogenous single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sites in the intronic region of the donor module. This protocol provides the detailed CRISPIE methodology, using endogenous labeling of β-actin in human U-2 OS cells with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as an example. When combined with the appropriate gene delivery methods, the same methodology can be applied to label post-mitotic neurons in culture and in vivo. This methodology can also be readily adapted for use in other gene editing contexts.

ABSTRACT:
Kinetoplastids are unicellular eukaryotic parasites responsible for human pathologies such as Chagas disease, sleeping sickness or Leishmaniasis, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and various Leishmania spp., respectively. They harbor a single large mitochondrion that is essential for the survival of the parasite. Interestingly, most of the mitochondrial gene expression machineries and processes present significant differences from their nuclear and cytosolic counterparts. A striking example concerns their mitochondrial ribosomes, in charge of translating the few essential mRNAs encoded by mitochondrial genomes. Here, we present a detailed protocol including the specific procedures to isolate mitochondria from two species of kinetoplastids, T. cruzi and L. tarentolae, by differential centrifugations. Then, we detail the protocol to purify mitochondrial ribosomal complexes from these two species of parasites (including ribosomal maturating complexes) by a sucrose gradient approach. Finally, we describe how to prepare cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids from these two sorts of samples. This protocol will be useful for further studies aiming at analyzing mitochondrial translation regulation.

PMID: 36353720

ABSTRACT:
When understanding the neuronal function of a specific neural circuit, single-cell level photoablation of a targeted cell is one of the useful experimental approaches. This protocol describes a method to photoablate specific motor neurons via the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG2), a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV)-based optogenetic tool used for ablating targeted cells in arbitrary areas. MiniSOG2 could induce the cell death pathway by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon blue light illumination. Photoablation of a specific cell using the miniSOG2 was performed to show that, in Ciona intestinalis type A ( Ciona robusta) , a single pair of motor neurons, MN2/A10.64, is necessary to drive their tail muscle contraction. The membrane targeted miniSOG2 combined with neuron-specific promoter (pSP-Neurog::miniSOG2-CAAX) was electroplated into the Ciona egg and transiently expressed at specific neurons of the embryo. MN2 labeled with pSP-Neurog:mCherry-CAAX was irradiated using a 440-nm laser from the lateral side for 10 min to ablate its neural function. The behavior of the embryo before and after the irradiation was recorded with a high-speed camera. Graphical abstract.

ABSTRACT:
In vitro microfluidic experimentation holds great potential to reveal many insights into the microphysiological phenomena occurring in conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). However, studies in microfluidic channels with dimensions physiologically relevant to the terminal bronchioles of the human lung currently face several challenges, especially due to difficulties in establishing appropriate cell culture conditions, including media flow rates, within a given culture environment. The presented protocol describes an image-based approach to evaluate the structure of NCI-H441 human lung epithelial cells cultured in an oxygen-impermeable microfluidic channel with dimensions physiologically relevant to the terminal bronchioles of the human lung. Using phalloidin-based filamentous-actin staining, the cytoskeletal structures of the cells are revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, allowing for the visualization of individual as well as layered cells. Subsequent quantification determines whether the cell culture conditions being employed are producing uniform monolayers suitable for further experimentation. The protocol describes cell culture and layer evaluation methods in microfluidic channels and traditional fixed-well environments. This includes channel construction, cell culture and requisite conditions, fixation, permeabilization and staining, confocal microscopic imaging, image processing, and data analysis.

ABSTRACT:
The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1) is the master regulator of cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. In the presence of pro-growth hormones and abundant nutrients, TORC1 is active and drives protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating a wide range of proteins. In contrast, when nitrogen and/or glucose levels fall, TORC1 is inhibited, causing the cell to switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism, and eventually enter a quiescent state. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC1 inhibition triggers the movement of TORC1 from its position around the vacuole to a single focus/body on the edge of the vacuolar membrane. This relocalization depends on the activity of numerous key TORC1 regulators and thus analysis of TORC1 localization can be used to follow signaling through the TORC1 pathway. Here we provide a detailed protocol for measuring TORC1 (specifically, Kog1-YFP) relocalization/signaling using fluorescence microscopy. Emphasis is placed on procedures that ensure: (1) TORC1-bodies are identified (and counted) correctly despite their relatively low fluorescence and the accumulation of autofluorescent foci during glucose and nitrogen starvation; (2) Cells are kept in log-phase growth at the start of each experiment so that the dynamics of TORC1-body formation are monitored correctly; (3) The appropriate fluorescent tags are used to avoid examining mislocalized TORC1.

JOURNAL: Bio-protocol (2021)
PMID: 33732803
DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.3916

ABSTRACT:
Initiation of the complement system results in the formation of a multiprotein pore termed the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-C9). MAC pores accumulate on a cell surface and can result in cell lysis. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a single monolayer of pigmented epithelial cells located at the posterior poll of the eye that forms the outer blood retinal barrier. RPE cells are highly polarized with apical microvilli and basolateral contact with Bruch's membrane. In order to obtain biologically relevant polarized RPE cultures in vitro, RPE cells are seeded onto the apical side of a transwell filter and cultured for 4 weeks in low serum media. MAC formation on RPE cells has been reported to be sub-lytic. MAC formation can be achieved in vitro by introduction of normal human serum (NHS) to media following serum starvation for 24 h. NHS contains all serum complement proteins required to initiate complement activation and MAC formation. We combined in vitro RPE polarization and complement activation to visualize MAC formation in vitro utilizing confocal microscopy allowing for high resolution MAC imaging.

ABSTRACT:
The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are tightly linked. The generation of ROS can be both the cause and a consequence of ER stress pathways, and an increasing number of human diseases are characterized by tissue atrophy in response to ER stress and oxidative injury. For the assessment of modulators of ER luminal ROS generation and for mechanistic studies, methods to monitor changes in ER reduction-oxidation (redox) states in a time-resolved and organelle-specific manner are needed. This has been greatly facilitated by the development of genetically encoded fluorescent probes, which can be targeted to different subcellular locations by specific amino acid extensions. One of these probes is the yellow fluorescent protein-based redox biosensor, HyPer. Here, we provide a protocol for the time-resolved monitoring of the oxidizing milieu in the ER of adherent mammalian cells using the ratiometric sensor, HyPerER, which is specifically targeted to the ER lumen.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2021)
PMID: 33871454
DOI: 10.3791/62296

ABSTRACT:
Vertebrate eye development is a complex process that begins near the end of embryo gastrulation and requires the precise coordination of cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Time-lapse imagining offers unique insight to the behavior of cells during eye development because it allows us to visualize oculogenesis in vivo. Zebrafish are an excellent model to visualize this process due to their highly conserved vertebrate eye and their ability to develop rapidly and externally while remaining optically transparent. Time-lapse imaging studies of zebrafish eye development are greatly facilitated by use of the transgenic zebrafish line Tg(rx3:GFP). In the developing forebrain, rx3:GFP expression marks the cells of the single eye field, and GFP continues to be expressed as the eye field evaginates to form an optic vesicle, which then invaginates to form an optic cup. High resolution time lapse imaging of rx3:GFP expression, therefore, allows us to track the eye primordium through time as it develops into the retina. Lightsheet microscopy is an ideal method to image ocular morphogenesis over time due to its ability to penetrate thicker samples for fluorescent imaging, minimize photobleaching and phototoxicity, and image at a high speed. Here, a protocol is provided for time-lapse imaging of ocular morphogenesis using a commercially available lightsheet microscope and an image processing workstation to analyze the resulting data. This protocol details the procedures for embryo anesthesia, embedding in low melting temperature agarose, suspension in the imaging chamber, setting up the imaging parameters, and finally analyzing the imaging data using image analysis software. The resulting dataset can provide valuable insights into the process of ocular morphogenesis, as well as perturbations to this process as a result of genetic mutation, exposure to pharmacological agents, or other experimental manipulations.

ABSTRACT:
Brain activity, the electrochemical signals passed between neurons, is determined by the connectivity patterns of neuronal networks, and from the morphology of processes and substructures within these neurons. As such, much of what is known about brain function has arisen alongside developments in imaging technologies that allow further insight into how neurons are organized and connected in the brain. Improvements in tissue clearing have allowed for high-resolution imaging of thick brain slices, facilitating morphological reconstruction and analyses of neuronal substructures, such as dendritic arbors and spines. In tandem, advances in image processing software provide methods of quickly analyzing large imaging datasets. This work presents a relatively rapid method of processing, visualizing, and analyzing thick slices of labeled neural tissue at high-resolution using CLARITY tissue clearing, confocal microscopy, and image analysis. This protocol will facilitate efforts toward understanding the connectivity patterns and neuronal morphologies that characterize healthy brains, and the changes in these characteristics that arise in diseased brain states.

ABSTRACT:
The development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms rely on coordinated regulation of cell migration. Cell migration is an essential event in the construction and regeneration of tissues, and is critical in embryonic development, immunological responses, and wound healing. Dysregulation of cell motility contributes to pathological disorders, such as chronic inflammation and cancer metastasis. Cell migration, tissue invasion, axon, and dendrite outgrowth all initiate with actin polymerization-mediated cell-edge protrusions. Here, we describe a simple, efficient, time-saving method for the imaging and quantitative analysis of cell-edge protrusion dynamics during spreading. This method measures discrete features of cell-edge membrane dynamics, such as protrusions, retractions, and ruffles, and can be used to assess how manipulations of key actin regulators impact cell-edge protrusions in diverse contexts.

ABSTRACT:
Determining the neuronal circuitry responsible for specific behaviors is a major focus in the field of neurobiology. Activity-dependent immediate early genes (IEGs), transcribed and translated shortly after neurons discharge action potentials, have been used extensively to either identify or gain genetic access to neurons and brain regions involved in such behaviors. By using immunohistochemistry for the protein product of the IEG c-Fos combined with retrograde labeling of specific neuronal populations, precise experimental timing, and identical data acquisition and processing, we present a method to quantitatively identify specific neuronal subpopulations that were active during social encounters. We have previously used this method to show a stronger recruitment of ventral hippocampal neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex, compared to those that project to the lateral hypothalamus, following social interactions. After optimization of surgeries for the injection of retrograde tracers, this method will be useful for the identification and mapping of neuronal populations engaged in many different behaviors.

ABSTRACT:
Neurotropic reoviruses repurpose host machinery to traffic over long distances in neuronal processes and access distal replication sites. Understanding mechanisms of neuronal transmission is facilitated by using simplified in vitro primary neuronal culture models. Advances in the design of compartmentalized microfluidic devices lend robustness to neuronal culture models by enabling compartmentalization and manipulation of distinct neuronal processes. Here, we describe a streamlined methodology to culture sensory neurons dissociated from dorsal root ganglia of embryonic rats in microfluidic devices. We further describe protocols to exogenously label reovirus and image, track, and analyze transport of single reovirus particles in living neurons. These techniques can be adapted to study directed axonal transport of other neurotropic viruses and neuronal factors involved in signaling and pathology.

ABSTRACT:
T follicular helper (Tfh) cells regulate B cell selection for entry into the germinal center (GC) reaction or for differentiation into antibody forming cells. This process takes place at the border between the T and B zones in lymphoid organs and involves physical contacts between T and B cells. During these interactions, T cells endow the B cells with selection signals that promote GC seeding or plasmablast differentiation based on their B cell receptor affinity. In Peyer's patches (PPs), T cells promote B cell colonization of the subepithelial dome (SED) without effective affinity-based clonal selection. To specifically characterize the T cell population that resides within the SED niche, we performed ex vivo photoactivation of the SED compartment followed by flow cytometry analysis of the labeled cells, as described in this protocol. This technique integrates both spatial and cellular information in studies of immunological niches and can be adapted to various experimental systems.

ABSTRACT:
Motility of eukaryotic cells or pathogens within tissues is mediated by the turnover of specific interactions with other cells or with the extracellular matrix. Biophysical characterization of these ligand-receptor adhesions helps to unravel the molecular mechanisms driving migration. Traction force microscopy or optical tweezers are typically used to measure the cellular forces exerted by cells on a substrate. However, the spatial resolution of traction force microscopy is limited to ~2 µm and performing experiments with optical traps is very time-consuming. Here we present the production of biomimetic surfaces that enable specific cell adhesion via synthetic ligands and at the same time monitor the transmitted forces by using molecular tension sensors. The ligands were coupled to double-stranded DNA probes with defined force thresholds for DNA unzipping. Receptor-mediated forces in the pN range are thereby semi-quantitatively converted into fluorescence signals, which can be detected by standard fluorescence microscopy at the resolution limit (~0.2 µm). The modular design of the assay allows to vary the presented ligands and the mechanical strength of the DNA probes, which provides a number of possibilities to probe the adhesion of different eukaryotic cell types and pathogens and is exemplified here with osteosarcoma cells and Plasmodium berghei Sporozoites.

PMID: 33659378

ABSTRACT:
Microtubule dynamic instability is driven by the hydrolysis of the GTP bound to the β-subunit of the α-β tubulin heterodimer. Nucleotide analogues are commonly used to mimic the different steps of the tubulin GTPase cycle, but most of them are poor microtubule nucleators. Usually, microtubule assembly is seeded by guanylyl-(α, β)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP) or glycerol that can be limiting factors in monitoring the effect of other nucleotide analogs on their polymerization. Here, we describe a protocol that allows the assembly of microtubules in the presence of nucleotide analogues without the need of heterogeneous seeds and at a low final glycerol concentration. Microtubules are first assembled in the presence of the analogue of interest and glycerol to promote assembly. These microtubules are then sonicated to produce seeds that will be used to assemble microtubules in the absence of glycerol. This strategy produces homogeneous nucleotide-bound microtubules that can be further analyzed by biochemical or structural methods such as cryo-electron microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Different viruses rely on direct cell-to-cell transmission to propagate infection within the infected host. Measuring this mode of transmission in cultured cells is often complicated by the contribution of cell free viruses to spread, and the difficulty to distinguish between primary infected cells that produce the virus and neighboring cells that are the target of spreading. Here, we present a protocol to quantify cell-to-cell transmission of the model pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus that is based on the co-culture of producer cells that are infected with a reporter virus expressing mCherry and target cells that stably express GFP. Spread of cell-free viruses is blocked by the presence of a neutralizing antibody in the cell culture medium, and cell-associated transmission is unequivocally quantified by numbering cells that are positive for both GFP and mCherry using automated analysis of fluorescence microscopy images.

ABSTRACT:
Nitric oxide (NO), is a redox-active, endogenous signalling molecule involved in the regulation of numerous processes. It plays a crucial role in adaptation and tolerance to various abiotic and biotic stresses. In higher plants, NO is produced either by enzymatic or non-enzymatic reduction of nitrite and an oxidative pathway requiring a putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like enzyme. There are several methods to measure NO production: mass spectrometry, tissue localization by DAF-FM dye. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) also known as electron spin resonance (ESR) and spectrophotometric assays. The activity of NOS can be measured by L-citrulline based assay and spectroscopic method (NADPH utilization method). A major route for the transfer of NO bioactivity is S-nitrosylation, the addition of a NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol forming an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). This experimental method describes visualization of NO using DAF-FM dye by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss AXIOSKOP 2). The whole procedure is simplified, so it is easy to perform but has a high sensitivity for NO detection. In addition, spectrophotometry based protocols for assay of NOS, Nitrate Reductase (NR) and the content of S-nitrosothiols are also described. These spectrophotometric protocols are easy to perform, less expensive and sufficiently sensitive assays which provide adequate information on NO based regulation of physiological processes depending on the treatments of interest.

ABSTRACT:
Quantifying cell-induced material deformation provides useful information concerning how cells sense and respond to the physical properties of their microenvironment. While many approaches exist for measuring cell-induced material strain, here we provide a methodology for monitoring strain with sub-micron resolution in a reference-free manner. Using a two-photon activated photolithographic patterning process, we demonstrate how to generate mechanically and bio-actively tunable synthetic substrates containing embedded arrays of fluorescent fiducial markers to easily measure three-dimensional (3D) material deformation profiles in response to surface tractions. Using these substrates, cell tension profiles can be mapped using a single 3D image stack of a cell of interest. Our goal with this methodology is to make traction force microscopy a more accessible and easier to implement tool for researchers studying cellular mechanotransduction processes, especially newcomers to the field.

ABSTRACT:
Microscopy is advancing at a rapid pace, enabling high-speed, high-resolution analyses to be conducted in a wide range of cellular contexts. For example, the capacity to quickly capture high-resolution images from multiple optical sections over multiple channels with confocal microscopy has allowed researchers to gain deeper understanding of tissue morphology via techniques such as three-dimensional rendering, as have more recent advances such as lattice light sheet microscopy and superresolution structured illumination microscopy. With this, though, comes the challenge of storing, curating, analysing and sharing data. While there are ways in which this has been attempted previously, few approaches have provided a central repository in which all of these different aspects of microscopy can be seamlessly integrated. Here, we describe a web-based storage and analysis platform called Microndata, that enables relatively straightforward storage, annotation, tracking, analysis and multi-user access to micrographs. This easy to use tool will simplify and harmonise laboratory work flows, and, importantly, will provide a central storage repository that is readily accessed, even after the researcher responsible for capturing the images has left the laboratory. Microndata is open-source software, available at http://www.microndata.net/.

ABSTRACT:
Confocal microscopy provides an accessible methodology to capture sub-cellular interactions critical for the characterization and further development of pre-clinical agents labeled with fluorescent probes. With recent advancements in antibody based cytotoxic drug delivery systems, understanding the alterations induced by these agents within the realm of receptor aggregation and internalization is of critical importance. This protocol leverages the well-established methodology of fluorescent immunocytochemistry and the open source FIJI distribution of ImageJ, with its inbuilt autocorrelation and image mathematical functions, to perform spatial image correlation spectroscopy (ICS). This protocol quantitates the fluorescent intensity of labeled receptors as a function of the beam area of the confocal microscope. This provides a quantitative measure of the state of target molecule aggregation on the cell surface. This methodology is focused on the characterization of static cells with potential to expand into temporal investigations of receptor aggregation. This protocol presents an accessible methodology to provide quantification of clustering events occurring at the cell surface, utilizing well established techniques and non-specialized imaging apparatus.

PMID: 29939169
DOI: 10.3791/56671

ABSTRACT:
Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy tomography (EFTEM tomography) can provide three-dimensional (3D) chemical maps of materials at a nanometric scale. EFTEM tomography can separate chemical elements that are very difficult to distinguish using other imaging techniques. The experimental protocol described here shows how to create 3D chemical maps to understand the chemical distribution and morphology of a material. Sample preparation steps for data segmentation are presented. This protocol permits the 3D distribution analysis of chemical elements in a nanometric sample. However, it should be noted that currently, the 3D chemical maps can only be generated for samples that are not beam sensitive, since the recording of filtered images requires long exposure times to an intense electron beam. The protocol was applied to quantify the chemical distribution of the components of two different heterogeneous catalyst supports. In the first study, the chemical distribution of aluminum and titanium in titania-alumina supports was analyzed. The samples were prepared using the swing-pH method. In the second, the chemical distribution of aluminum and silicon in silica-alumina supports that were prepared using the sol-powder and mechanical mixture methods was examined.

TITLE: Fabrication of Refractive-index-matched Devices for Biomedical Microfluidics.
AUTHORS: Polanco Edward R, Western Nicholas, Zangle Thomas A
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2018)
PMID: 30247465
DOI: 10.3791/58296

ABSTRACT:
The use of microfluidic devices has emerged as a defining tool for biomedical applications. When combined with modern microscopy techniques, these devices can be implemented as part of a robust platform capable of making simultaneous complementary measurements. The primary challenge created by the combination of these two techniques is the mismatch in refractive index between the materials traditionally used to make microfluidic devices and the aqueous solutions typically used in biomedicine. This mismatch can create optical artifacts near the channel or device edges. One solution is to reduce the refractive index of the material used to fabricate the device by using a fluorinated polymer such as MY133-V2000 whose refractive index is similar to that of water (n = 1.33). Here, the construction of a microfluidic device made out of MY133-V2000 using soft lithography techniques is demonstrated, using O2 plasma in conjunction with an acrylic holder to increase the adhesion between the MY133-V2000 fabricated device and the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The device is then tested by incubating it filled with cell culture media for 24 h to demonstrate the ability of the device to maintain cell culture conditions during the course of a typical imaging experiment. Finally, quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) is used to measure the distribution of mass within the live adherent cells in the microchannel. This way, the increased precision, enabled by fabricating the device from a low index of refraction polymer such as MY133-V2000 in lieu of traditional soft lithography materials such as PDMS, is demonstrated. Overall, this approach for fabricating microfluidic devices can be readily integrated into existing soft lithography workflows in order to reduce optical artifacts and increase measurement precision.

TITLE: Lighting Up the Pathways to Caspase Activation Using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation.
AUTHORS: Charendoff Chloé I, Bouchier-Hayes Lisa
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2018)
PMID: 29553529
DOI: 10.3791/57316

ABSTRACT:
The caspase family of proteases play essential roles in apoptosis and innate immunity. Among these, a subgroup known as initiator caspases are the first to be activated in these pathways. This group includes caspase-2, -8, and -9, as well as the inflammatory caspases, caspase-1, -4, and -5. The initiator caspases are all activated by dimerization following recruitment to specific multiprotein complexes called activation platforms. Caspase Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) is an imaging-based approach where split fluorescent proteins fused to initiator caspases are used to visualize the recruitment of initiator caspases to their activation platforms and the resulting induced proximity. This fluorescence provides a readout of one of the earliest steps required for initiator caspase activation. Using a number of different microscopy-based approaches, this technique can provide quantitative data on the efficiency of caspase activation on a population level as well as the kinetics of caspase activation and the size and number of caspase activating complexes on a per cell basis.

DOI: 10.3791/58634

ABSTRACT:
Immobilization of genes on lithographically structured surfaces allows the study of compartmentalized gene expression processes in an open microfluidic bioreactor system. In contrast to other approaches towards artificial cellular systems, such a setup allows for a continuous supply with gene expression reagents and simultaneous draining of waste products. This facilitates the implementation of cell-free gene expression processes over extended periods of time, which is important for the realization of dynamic gene regulatory feedback systems. Here we provide a detailed protocol for the fabrication of genetic biochips using a simple-to-use lithographic technique based on DNA strand displacement reactions, which exclusively uses commercially available components. We also provide a protocol on the integration of compartmentalized genes with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic system. Furthermore, we show that the system is compatible with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which can be used for the direct observation of molecular interactions between DNA and molecules contained in the expression mix.

AUTHORS: Roobala C, Ilanila I P, Basu J K
JOURNAL: Journal of biosciences (2018)
PMID: 30002267

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence microscopy, especially confocal microscopy, has revolutionized the field of biological imaging. Breaking the optical diffraction barrier of conventional light microscopy, through the advent of super-resolution microscopy, has ushered in the potential for a second revolution through unprecedented insight into nanoscale structure and dynamics in biological systems. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy is one such super-resolution microscopy technique which provides real-time enhanced-resolution imaging capabilities. In addition, it can be easily integrated with well-established fluorescence-based techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in order to capture the structure of cellular membranes at the nanoscale with high temporal resolution. In this review, we discuss the theory of STED and different modalities of operation in order to achieve the best resolution. Various applications of this technique in cell imaging, especially that of neuronal cell imaging, are discussed as well as examples of application of STED imaging in unravelling structure formation on biological membranes. Finally, we have discussed examples from some of our recent studies on nanoscale structure and dynamics of lipids in model membranes, due to interaction with proteins, as revealed by combination of STED and FCS techniques.

ABSTRACT:
The three-dimensional organisation of cells in a tissue and their interaction with adjacent cells and extracellular matrix is a key determinant of cellular responses, including how tumour cells respond to stress conditions or therapeutic drugs (Elliott and Yuan, 2011). In vivo, tumour cells are embedded in a stroma formed primarily by fibroblasts that produce an extracellular matrix and enwoven with blood vessels. The 3D mixed cell type spheroid model described here incorporates these key features of the tissue microenvironment that in vivo tumours exist in; namely the three-dimensional organisation, the most abundant stromal cell types (fibroblasts and endothelial cells), and extracellular matrix. This method combined with confocal microscopy can be a powerful tool to carry out drug sensitivity, angiogenesis and cell migration/invasion assays of different tumour types.

PMID: 34595253

ABSTRACT:
The only motile cells produced in land plants are male gametes (spermatozoids), which are reduced to non-flagellated cells in flowering plants and most gymnosperms. Although a coiled architecture is universal, the complexity of land plant flagellated cells varies from biflagellated in bryophytes to thousands of flagella per gametes in the seed plants Ginkgo and cycads. This wide diversity in number of flagella is associated with vast differences in cell size and shape. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has played an important role in characterizing the external form, including cell shape and arrangement of flagella, across the varied motile gametes of land plants. Because of the size and scarcity of released swimming sperm, it is difficult to concentrate them and prepare them for observation in the SEM. Here we detail an SEM preparation technique that yields good preservation of sperms cells across plant groups.

ABSTRACT:
This protocol was developed to study protein localisation within the vascular bundles of developing tomato fruit however, it can be applied to any resin embedded plant tissue. The vascular bundle is comprised of many different cells that all have unique properties. The mature sieve elements are enucleated and contain sieve plates that comprise of callose. This method has utilised these properties of the sieve element by combining immunohistochemistry for cell wall invertase with counterstaining of aniline blue for callose, DAPI for nucleus and cell structure is shown with the final staining of the cell wall using calcofluor white. It must be noted that when following this protocol, it is vital for the sections to be flat and fixed to the slide with gelatine so cover slip removal does not move the sample section. This protocol will be applicable to all plant tissues and provides additional evidence of the protein localisation within the cell by conducting a counterstaining procedure.

ABSTRACT:
Investigation of protein targeting to plastids in plants by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) can be complicated by numerous sources of artifact, ranging from misinterpretations from in vivo protein over-expression, false fluorescence in cells under stress, and organellar mis-identification. Our studies have focused on the plant-specific gene MSH1, which encodes a dual targeting protein that is regulated in its expression and resides within the nucleoid of a specialized plastid type ( Virdi et al., 2016 ). Therefore, our methods have been optimized to study protein dual targeting to mitochondria and plastids, spatial and temporal regulation of protein expression, and sub-organellar localization, producing a protocol and set of experimental standards that others may find useful for such studies.

TITLE: DiI Perfusion as a Method for Vascular Visualization in Ambystoma mexicanum.
AUTHORS: Saltman Anna J, Barakat May, Bryant Donald M, Brodovskaya Anastasia, Whited Jessica L

PMID: 28654050
DOI: 10.3791/55740

ABSTRACT:
Perfusion techniques have been used for centuries to visualize the circulation of tissues. Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is a species of salamander that has emerged as an essential model for regeneration studies. Little is known about how revascularization occurs in the context of regeneration in these animals. Here we report a simple method for visualization of the vasculature in axolotl via perfusion of 1,1'-Dioctadecy-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI). DiI is a lipophilic carbocyanine dye that inserts into the plasma membrane of endothelial cells instantaneously. Perfusion is done using a peristaltic pump such that DiI enters the circulation through the aorta. During perfusion, dye flows through the axolotl's blood vessels and incorporates into the lipid bilayer of vascular endothelial cells upon contact. The perfusion procedure takes approximately one hour for an eight-inch axolotl. Immediately after perfusion with DiI, the axolotl can be visualized with a confocal fluorescent microscope. The DiI emits light in the red-orange range when excited with a green fluorescent filter. This DiI perfusion procedure can be used to visualize the vascular structure of axolotls or to demonstrate patterns of revascularization in regenerating tissues.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2017)
PMID: 28190032
DOI: 10.3791/55149

ABSTRACT:
A nanoscale fabrication technique appropriate for milling carbon nanotube (CNT) forests is described. The technique utilizes an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) operating with a low pressure water vapor ambient. In this technique, a portion of the electron beam interacts with the water vapor in the vicinity of the CNT sample, dissociating the water molecules into hydroxyl radicals and other species by radiolysis. The remainder of the electron beam interacts with the CNT forest sample, making it susceptible to oxidation from the chemical products of radiolysis. This technique may be used to trim a selected region of an individual CNT, or it may be used to remove hundreds of cubic microns of material by adjusting ESEM parameters. The machining resolution is similar to the imaging resolution of the ESEM itself. The technique produces only small quantities of carbon residue along the boundaries of the cutting zone, with minimal effect on the native structural morphology of the CNT forest.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2017)
PMID: 28829411
DOI: 10.3791/56009

ABSTRACT:
Here, we describe a protocol that allows for shape-anisotropic cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs), such as nanorods (NRs) and tetrapods (TPs), to be covalently and site-specifically linked via their end facets, resulting in polymer-like linear or branched chains. The linking procedure begins with a cation-exchange process in which the end facets of the cadmium chalcogenide NCs are first converted to silver chalcogenide. This is followed by the selective removal of ligands at their surface. This results in cadmium chalcogenide NCs with highly reactive silver chalcogenide end facets that spontaneously fuse upon contact with each other, thereby establishing an interparticle facet-to-facet attachment. Through the judicious choice of precursor concentrations, an extensive network of linked NCs can be produced. Structural characterization of the linked NCs is carried out via low- and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which confirm the presence of silver chalcogenide domains between chains of cadmium chalcogenide NCs.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2017)

DOI: 10.3791/55703

ABSTRACT:
The DNA damage response orchestrates the repair of DNA lesions that occur spontaneously, are caused by genotoxic stress, or appear in the context of programmed DNA breaks in lymphocytes. The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated kinase (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-Related kinase (ATR) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PKcs) are among the first that are activated upon induction of DNA damage, and are central regulators of a network that controls DNA repair, apoptosis and cell survival. As part of a tumor-suppressive pathway, ATM and ATR activate p53 through phosphorylation, thereby regulating the transcriptional activity of p53. DNA damage also results in the formation of so-called ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that represent complexes of DNA damage sensor and repair proteins that accumulate at the sites of DNA damage, which are visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Co-localization of proteins in IRIFs, however, does not necessarily imply direct protein-protein interactions, as the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is limited. In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) is a novel technique that allows the direct visualization of protein-protein interactions in cells and tissues with unprecedented specificity and sensitivity. This technique is based on the spatial proximity of specific antibodies binding to the proteins of interest. When the interrogated proteins are within ~40 nm an amplification reaction is triggered by oligonucleotides that are conjugated to the antibodies, and the amplification product is visualized by fluorescent labeling, yielding a signal that corresponds to the subcellular location of the interacting proteins. Using the established functional interaction between ATM and p53 as an example, it is demonstrated here how PLA can be used in suspension cell cultures to study the direct interactions between proteins that are integral parts of the DNA damage response.

ABSTRACT:
Infrared (IR) spectro-microscopy of living biological samples is hampered by the absorption of water in the mid-IR range and by the lack of suitable microfluidic devices. Here, a protocol for the fabrication of plastic microfluidic devices is demonstrated, where soft lithographic techniques are used to embed transparent Calcium Fluoride (CaF2) view-ports in connection with observation chamber(s). The method is based on a replica casting approach, where a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold is produced through standard lithographic procedures and then used as the template to produce a plastic device. The plastic device features ultraviolet/visible/infrared (UV/Vis/IR) -transparent windows made of CaF2 to allow for direct observation with visible and IR light. The advantages of the proposed method include: a reduced need for accessing a clean room micro-fabrication facility, multiple view-ports, an easy and versatile connection to an external pumping system through the plastic body, flexibility of the design, e.g., open/closed channels configuration, and the possibility to add sophisticated features such as nanoporous membranes.

ABSTRACT:
GnRH analogues are effective targeting moieties and able to deliver anticancer agents selectively into malignant tumor cells which highly express GnRH receptors. However, the quantitative analysis of GnRH analogues' cellular uptake and the investigated cell types in GnRH-based drug delivery systems are currently limited. Previously introduced, selectively labeled fluorescent GnRH I, -II and -III derivatives provide great detectability, and they have suitable chemical properties for reproducible and robust experiments. We also found that the appropriate up-to-date methods with these labeled GnRH analogues could offer novel information about the GnRH-based drug delivery systems. This manuscript introduces some simple and fast experiments regarding the cellular uptake of [D-Lys6(FITC)]-GnRH-I, [D-Lys6(FITC)]-GnRH-II and [Lys8(FITC)]-GnRH-III on the EBC-1 (lung), the BxPC-3 (pancreas) and on the Detroit-562- (pharynx) malignant tumor cells. In parallel with these GnRH-FITC conjugates, the cell surface level of GnRH-I receptors was also examined on these cell lines before and after the GnRH treatment by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The cellular uptake of GnRH-FITC conjugates was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In these experiments minor differences among GnRH analogues and major differences among cell types was observed. The significant differences among cell lines are correlated with their distinct level of cell surface GnRH-I receptors. The introduced experiments contain practical methods to visualize, quantify and compare the uptake efficiency of GnRH-FITC conjugates in a time- and concentration-dependent manner on various adherent cell cultures. These results could predict the drug targeting efficiency of GnRH conjugates on the given cell culture, and offer a good basis for further experiments in the examination of GnRH-based drug delivery systems.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Accidental oil spills in the Nile River represents a public health concern in Egypt. Bioremediation of oil-contaminated water is efficiently competitive and economically effective compared to mechanical and chemical methods. AIM: The current study aimed to: i) assess using environment-friendly materials as carriers for immobilizing oil-degrading bacteria and ii) evaluate applying these biocarriers for removal of oil from water in a batch experiment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four bacterial strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cronobacter sakazakii (recently named Enterobacter sakazakii), Klebsiella oxytoca and Bordetella bronchispetica were immobilized on grinded corn qgualh, Egyptian loofah, palm leaf raffia and sponge. Immobilizing bacterial consortium was carried out by incubating bacteria with carriers at 37°C with shaking at 120 rpm for three days. Biofilm formed on biocarriers was checked using scanning electron microscopy. Biocarriers with immobilized bacterial consortium were used for the removal of oil. Experiments were carried out in flasks each containing 100 ml of mineral salt broth fortified with 1 g/l light crude oil. Flasks were incubated at 37°C with shaking at 120 rpm for nine weeks. Total viable bacterial count and oil and grease were determined weekly. RESULTS: Oil and grease measurements showed a significant removal that reached 68.3, 71.5, 77.7 and 81% for grinded corn qgualh, Egyptian loofah, palm leaf raffia and sponge respectively. Flasks inoculated with sponge biocarriers showed rapid oil removal compared with other biocarriers. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed a percentage removal that reached 87% for compounds C11 to C32 in case of sponge carrier. CONCLUSION: Immobilizing bacteria on biocarriers showed a good biofilm formation. Immobilized bacterial consortium showed rapid and efficient oil removal in bioremediation processes. Sponge showed dense bacterial colonization and consequently biofilm formation compared with other biocarriers.

METHODS:
Four bacterial strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cronobacter sakazakii (recently named Enterobacter sakazakii), Klebsiella oxytoca and Bordetella bronchispetica were immobilized on grinded corn qgualh, Egyptian loofah, palm leaf raffia and sponge. Immobilizing bacterial consortium was carried out by incubating bacteria with carriers at 37°C with shaking at 120 rpm for three days. Biofilm formed on biocarriers was checked using scanning electron microscopy. Biocarriers with immobilized bacterial consortium were used for the removal of oil. Experiments were carried out in flasks each containing 100 ml of mineral salt broth fortified with 1 g/l light crude oil. Flasks were incubated at 37°C with shaking at 120 rpm for nine weeks. Total viable bacterial count and oil and grease were determined weekly.

ABSTRACT:
UNLABELLED: The aim of this protocol is to describe how to measure and quantify the amount of HIV-1 particles and dextran molecules internalized in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), using three different techniques: flow cytometry, quantitative PCR and confocal microscopy. BACKGROUND: This protocol was developed in order to assess the changes of HIV-1 internalization upon disruption of actin nucleation in human monocyte derived dendritic cells. Following a shRNA screen to identify genes important for HIV-1 transfer from dendritic cells to T cells, we observed that a disruption of actin nucleation leads to a switch from actin rich dendrites to blebs, due to an excess of actomyosin contraction. As a consequence, a decrease of HIV-1 transfer and an increase of HIV-1 internalization due to bleb retraction-driven macropinocytosis were observed. We concluded that effectors of actin nucleation and stabilization were key to maintain HIV-1 on actin-rich dendrites and to limit its endocytosis, for efficient transfer to T lymphocytes (Menager and Littman, 2016).

ABSTRACT:
The sclera is a dense connective tissue that covers and protects the eye. It mainly consists of dense collagen bundles (types I, III, IV, V, VI, and VII). Due to its autofluorescence, opaqueness, and thickness, it has not been found suitable for confocal microscopy. An alternative approach to the one presented here, which uses formalin-fixed sclera embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry, has technical challenges, especially when preheating the tissue for antigen retrieval. Since the sclera is relatively poor in both cells and vessels, the use of larger tissue samples was explored to help prevent overlooking cells and to understand their localization in relation to vessels and other anatomical sites. To allow for the analysis of larger tissue samples under the confocal microscope, a laminating technique was performed to create thin layers from the sclera. Following the analysis of results of CD31 blood vessels and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1) positive cells, for which approval for scientific examination was obtained, the advantages and limitations of this method are discussed.

ABSTRACT:
Thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm)-immobilized surfaces for controlling cell adhesion and detachment were fabricated by the Langmuir-Schaefer method. Amphiphilic block copolymers composed of polystyrene and PIPAAm (St-IPAAms) were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization. A chloroform solution of St-IPAAm molecules was gently dropped into a Langmuir-trough apparatus, and both barriers of the apparatus were moved horizontally to compress the film to regulate its density. Then, the St-IPAAm Langmuir film was horizontally transferred onto a hydrophobically modified glass substrate by a surface-fixed device. Atomic force microscopy images clearly revealed nanoscale sea-island structures on the surface. The strength, rate, and quality of cell adhesion and detachment on the prepared surface were modulated by changes in temperature across the lower critical solution temperature range of PIPAAm molecules. In addition, a two-dimensional cell structure (cell sheet) was successfully recovered on the optimized surfaces. These unique PIPAAm surfaces may be useful for controlling the strength of cell adhesion and detachment.

ABSTRACT:
In this work, a facile one-pot reaction for the formation of metal nanoparticles in a water solution through the use of n-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminosilanetriol is presented. This compound can be used to effectively reduce and complex metal salts into metal core nanoparticles coated with the compound. By controlling the concentrations of salt and silane one is able to control reaction rates, particle size, and nanoparticle coating. The effects of these changes were characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectrometry (UV-Vis), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). A unique aspect to this reaction is that usually silanes hydrolyze and cross-link in water; however, in this system the silane is water-soluble and stable. It is known that silicon and amino moieties can form complexes with metal salts. The silicon is known to extend its coordination sphere to form penta- or hexa-coordinated species. Furthermore, the silanol group can undergo hydrolysis to form a Si-O-Si silica network, thereby transforming the metal nanoparticles into a functionalized nanocomposites.

ABSTRACT:
A two-step chemical vapor deposition procedure is here employed to prepare tree-like hierarchical ZnO/CdSSe hetero-nanostructures. The structures are composed of CdSSe branches grown on ZnO nanowires that are vertically aligned on a transparent sapphire substrate. The morphology was measured via scanning electron microscopy. The crystal structure was determined by X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Both the ZnO stem and CdSSe branches have a predominantly wurtzite crystal structure. The mole ratio of S and Se in the CdSSe branches was measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The CdSSe branches result in strong visible light absorption. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy showed that the stem and branches form a type-II heterojunction. PL lifetime measurements showed a decrease in the lifetime of emission from the trees when compared to emission from individual ZnO stems or CdSSe branches and indicate fast charge transfer between CdSSe and ZnO. The vertically aligned ZnO stems provide a direct electron transport pathway to the substrate and allow for efficient charge separation after photoexcitation by visible light. The combination of the abovementioned properties makes ZnO/CdSSe nanotrees promising candidates for applications in solar cells, photocatalysis, and opto-electronic devices.

ABSTRACT:
Obstacles present on DNA, including tightly-bound proteins and various lesions, can severely inhibit the progression of the cell's replication machinery. The stalling of a replisome can lead to its dissociation from the chromosome, either in part or its entirety, leading to the collapse of the replication fork. The recovery from this collapse is a necessity for the cell to accurately complete chromosomal duplication and subsequently divide. Therefore, when the collapse occurs, the cell has evolved diverse mechanisms that take place to restore the DNA fork and allow replication to be completed with high fidelity. Previously, these replication repair pathways in bacteria have been studied using UV damage, which has the disadvantage of not being localized to a known site. This manuscript describes a system utilizing a Fluorescence Repressor Operator System (FROS) to create a site-specific protein block that can induce the stalling and collapse of replication forks in Escherichia coli. Protocols detail how the status of replication can be visualized in single living cells using fluorescence microscopy and DNA replication intermediates can be analyzed by 2-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. Temperature sensitive mutants of replisome components (e.g. DnaBts) can be incorporated into the system to induce a synchronous collapse of the replication forks. Furthermore, the roles of the recombination proteins and helicases that are involved in these processes can be studied using genetic knockouts within this system.

PMID: 25741895
DOI: 10.3791/52577

ABSTRACT:
The study of cellular quality control systems has emerged as a highly dynamic and relevant field of contemporary research. It has become clear that cells possess several lines of defense against damage to biologically relevant molecules like nucleic acids, lipids and proteins. In addition to organelle dynamics (fusion/fission/motility/inheritance) and tightly controlled protease activity, the degradation of surplus, damaged or compromised organelles by autophagy (cellular 'self-eating') has received much attention from the scientific community. The regulation of autophagy is quite complex and depends on genetic and environmental factors, many of which have so far not been elucidated. Here a novel method is presented that allows the convenient study of autophagy in the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. It is based on growth of the fungus on so-called 'starvation pads' for stimulation of autophagy in a reproducible manner. Samples are directly assayed by microscopy and evaluated for autophagy induction / progress. The protocol presented here is not limited for use with P. chrysogenum and can be easily adapted for use in other filamentous fungi.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) with desirable chemical, optical and mechanical properties are promising tools to label intracellular organelles. Here, we introduce a method using gold-BSA-rhodamine NPs to label the endo-lysosomal system of eukaryotic cells and monitor manipulations of host cellular pathways by the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica. The NPs were readily internalized by HeLa cells and localized in late endosomes/lysosomes. Salmonella infection induced rearrangement of the vesicles and accumulation of NPs in Salmonella-induced membrane structures. We deployed the Imaris software package for quantitative analyses of confocal microscopy images. The number of objects and their size distribution in non-infected cells were distinct from the ones in Salmonella-infected cells, indicating extremely remodeling of the endo-lysosomal system by WT Salmonella.

TITLE: Tracking Drug-induced Changes in Receptor Post-internalization Trafficking by Colocalizational Analysis.
AUTHORS: Ong Edmund, Cahill Catherine
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2015)
PMID: 26167890
DOI: 10.3791/52824

ABSTRACT:
The intracellular trafficking of receptors is a collection of complex and highly controlled processes. Receptor trafficking modulates signaling and overall cell responsiveness to ligands and is, itself, influenced by intra- and extracellular conditions, including ligand-induced signaling. Optimized for use with monolayer-plated cultured cells, but extendable to free-floating tissue slices, this protocol uses immunolabelling and colocalizational analysis to track changes in intracellular receptor trafficking following both chronic/prolonged and acute interventions, including exogenous drug treatment. After drug treatment, cells are double-immunolabelled for the receptor and for markers for the intracellular compartments of interest. Sequential confocal microscopy is then used to capture two-channel photomicrographs of individual cells, which are subjected to computerized colocalizational analysis to yield quantitative colocalization scores. These scores are normalized to permit pooling of independent replicates prior to statistical analysis. Representative photomicrographs may also be processed to generate illustrative figures. Here, we describe a powerful and flexible technique for quantitatively assessing induced receptor trafficking.

TITLE: Selective Area Modification of Silicon Surface Wettability by Pulsed UV Laser Irradiation in Liquid Environment.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2015)
PMID: 26575362
DOI: 10.3791/52720

ABSTRACT:
The wettability of silicon (Si) is one of the important parameters in the technology of surface functionalization of this material and fabrication of biosensing devices. We report on a protocol of using KrF and ArF lasers irradiating Si (001) samples immersed in a liquid environment with low number of pulses and operating at moderately low pulse fluences to induce Si wettability modification. Wafers immersed for up to 4 hr in a 0.01% H2O2/H2O solution did not show measurable change in their initial contact angle (CA) ~75°. However, the 500-pulse KrF and ArF lasers irradiation of such wafers in a microchamber filled with 0.01% H2O2/H2O solution at 250 and 65 mJ/cm(2), respectively, has decreased the CA to near 15°, indicating the formation of a superhydrophilic surface. The formation of OH-terminated Si (001), with no measurable change of the wafer's surface morphology, has been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements. The selective area irradiated samples were then immersed in a biotin-conjugated fluorescein-stained nanospheres solution for 2 hr, resulting in a successful immobilization of the nanospheres in the non-irradiated area. This illustrates the potential of the method for selective area biofunctionalization and fabrication of advanced Si-based biosensing architectures. We also describe a similar protocol of irradiation of wafers immersed in methanol (CH3OH) using ArF laser operating at pulse fluence of 65 mJ/cm(2) and in situ formation of a strongly hydrophobic surface of Si (001) with the CA of 103°. The XPS results indicate ArF laser induced formation of Si-(OCH3)x compounds responsible for the observed hydrophobicity. However, no such compounds were found by XPS on the Si surface irradiated by KrF laser in methanol, demonstrating the inability of the KrF laser to photodissociate methanol and create -OCH3 radicals.

ABSTRACT:
We report a novel adaptation of the Radial Monolayer Cell Migration assay, first reported to measure the radial migration of adherent tumor cells on extracellular matrix proteins, for measuring the motility of fluorescently-labeled, non-adherent human or murine effector immune cells. This technique employs a stainless steel manifold and 10-well Teflon slide to focally deposit non-adherent T cells into wells prepared with either confluent tumor cell monolayers or extracellular matrix proteins. Light and/or multi-channel fluorescence microscopy is used to track the movement and behavior of the effector cells over time. Fluorescent dyes and/or viral vectors that code for fluorescent transgenes are used to differentially label the cell types for imaging. This method is distinct from similar-type in vitro assays that track horizontal or vertical migration/invasion utilizing slide chambers, agar or transwell plates. The assay allows detailed imaging data to be collected with different cell types distinguished by specific fluorescent markers; even specific subpopulations of cells (i.e., transduced/nontransduced) can be monitored. Surface intensity fluorescence plots are generated using specific fluorescence channels that correspond to the migrating cell type. This allows for better visualization of the non-adherent immune cell mobility at specific times. It is possible to gather evidence of other effector cell functions, such as cytotoxicity or transfer of viral vectors from effector to target cells, as well. Thus, the method allows researchers to microscopically document cell-to-cell interactions of differentially-labeled, non-adherent with adherent cells of various types. Such information may be especially relevant in the assessment of biologically-manipulated or activated immune cell types, where visual proof of functionality is desired with tumor target cells before their use for cancer therapy.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Phoenix Dactyliferia pit powder on nicotine-induced spermatotoxicty in adult albino mice. METHODS: The study was conducted at the University of Health Sciences, Lahore, from February to November 2012, and comprised adult male albino mice aged 6-8 weeks. The animals were divided into five equal groups. Group A consisted of controls who were treated with 1.5ml/kg of normal saline for 15 days, while nicotine 0.5mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally daily to experimental groups B, C and D for the first 15 days. Group B was sacrificed on the 15th day to confirm toxicity, whereas nicotine treatment was stopped in groups C and D. Group C was given normal saline (1.5ml/kg) whereas group D was given date palm pit powder 500mg/kg for the next 30 days. However, Group E was given nicotine 0.5mg/kg for 45 days and date palm pit powder was added orally from the 16th day and it continued daily till the end of the experiment. SPSS 18 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean weight of each of the 40 animals in the study was 30±5gm, and all the five groups hacL8(20%) mice each. Group B exhibited features of toxicity evident by statistically significant decrease in Johnsen score (p<0.001) and diameter of seminiferous tubule (p<0.001). Group C showed partial reversal of toxic effects but these positive effects were less compared to group D which showed complete reversal of toxicity evident by statistically significant increase in Johnsen score (p<0.001) and diameter of seminiferous tubule (p<0.001). However, reversal of toxic effect was not evident in group E. CONCLUSION: Partial recovery from nicotine-induced spermatotoxicity occurred after withdrawal of nicotine treatment whereas near normal restoration of structure was seen with administration of date palm pit powder after the stoppage of nicotine.

ABSTRACT:
Every two years, the French Society for Cell Biology (SBCF) organises an international meeting called 'Imaging the Cell'. This year, the 8th edition was held on 24-26 June 2015 at University of Bordeaux Campus Victoire in the city of Bordeaux, France, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Over the course of three days, the meeting provided a forum for experts in different areas of cell imaging. Its unique approach was to combine conventional oral presentations during morning sessions with practical workshops at hosting institutes and the Bordeaux Imaging Center during the afternoons. The meeting, co-organised by Violaine Moreau and Frédéric Saltel (both INSERM U1053, Bordeaux, France), Christel Poujol and Fabrice Cordelières (both Bordeaux Imaging Center, Bordeaux, France) and Isabelle Sagot (Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, Bordeaux, France), brought together about 120 scientists including 16 outstanding speakers to discuss the latest advances in cell imaging. Thanks to recent progress in imaging technologies, cell biologists are now able to visualise, follow and manipulate cellular processes with unprecedented accuracy. The meeting sessions and workshops highlighted some of the most exciting developments in the field, with sessions dedicated to optogenetics, high-content screening, in vivo and live-cell imaging, correlative light and electron microscopy, as well as super-resolution imaging.

TITLE: Atomic force microscopy of red-light photoreceptors using peakforce quantitative nanomechanical property mapping.

ABSTRACT:
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) uses a pyramidal tip attached to a cantilever to probe the force response of a surface. The deflections of the tip can be measured to ~10 pN by a laser and sectored detector, which can be converted to image topography. Amplitude modulation or "tapping mode" AFM involves the probe making intermittent contact with the surface while oscillating at its resonant frequency to produce an image. Used in conjunction with a fluid cell, tapping-mode AFM enables the imaging of biological macromolecules such as proteins in physiologically relevant conditions. Tapping-mode AFM requires manual tuning of the probe and frequent adjustments of a multitude of scanning parameters which can be challenging for inexperienced users. To obtain high-quality images, these adjustments are the most time consuming. PeakForce Quantitative Nanomechanical Property Mapping (PF-QNM) produces an image by measuring a force response curve for every point of contact with the sample. With ScanAsyst software, PF-QNM can be automated. This software adjusts the set-point, drive frequency, scan rate, gains, and other important scanning parameters automatically for a given sample. Not only does this process protect both fragile probes and samples, it significantly reduces the time required to obtain high resolution images. PF-QNM is compatible for AFM imaging in fluid; therefore, it has extensive application for imaging biologically relevant materials. The method presented in this paper describes the application of PF-QNM to obtain images of a bacterial red-light photoreceptor, RpBphP3 (P3), from photosynthetic R. palustris in its light-adapted state. Using this method, individual protein dimers of P3 and aggregates of dimers have been observed on a mica surface in the presence of an imaging buffer. With appropriate adjustments to surface and/or solution concentration, this method may be generally applied to other biologically relevant macromolecules and soft materials.

TITLE: Fundamental technical elements of freeze-fracture/freeze-etch in biological electron microscopy.
AUTHORS: Carson Johnny L
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2014)
PMID: 25285532
DOI: 10.3791/51694

ABSTRACT:
Freeze-fracture/freeze-etch describes a process whereby specimens, typically biological or nanomaterial in nature, are frozen, fractured, and replicated to generate a carbon/platinum "cast" intended for examination by transmission electron microscopy. Specimens are subjected to ultrarapid freezing rates, often in the presence of cryoprotective agents to limit ice crystal formation, with subsequent fracturing of the specimen at liquid nitrogen cooled temperatures under high vacuum. The resultant fractured surface is replicated and stabilized by evaporation of carbon and platinum from an angle that confers surface three-dimensional detail to the cast. This technique has proved particularly enlightening for the investigation of cell membranes and their specializations and has contributed considerably to the understanding of cellular form to related cell function. In this report, we survey the instrument requirements and technical protocol for performing freeze-fracture, the associated nomenclature and characteristics of fracture planes, variations on the conventional procedure, and criteria for interpretation of freeze-fracture images. This technique has been widely used for ultrastructural investigation in many areas of cell biology and holds promise as an emerging imaging technique for molecular, nanotechnology, and materials science studies.

ABSTRACT:
The HER2+ tumor-targeted nanoparticle, HerDox, exhibits tumor-preferential accumulation and tumor-growth ablation in an animal model of HER2+ cancer. HerDox is formed by non-covalent self-assembly of a tumor targeted cell penetration protein with the chemotherapy agent, doxorubicin, via a small nucleic acid linker. A combination of electrophilic, intercalation, and oligomerization interactions facilitate self-assembly into round 10-20 nm particles. HerDox exhibits stability in blood as well as in extended storage at different temperatures. Systemic delivery of HerDox in tumor-bearing mice results in tumor-cell death with no detectable adverse effects to non-tumor tissue, including the heart and liver (which undergo marked damage by untargeted doxorubicin). HER2 elevation facilitates targeting to cells expressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor, hence tumors displaying elevated HER2 levels exhibit greater accumulation of HerDox compared to cells expressing lower levels, both in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescence intensity imaging combined with in situ confocal and spectral analysis has allowed us to verify in vivo tumor targeting and tumor cell penetration of HerDox after systemic delivery. Here we detail our methods for assessing tumor targeting via multimode imaging after systemic delivery.

TITLE: Spatial filtering nearly eliminates the side-lobes in single- and multi-photon 4pi-type-C super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution microscopy has tremendously progressed our understanding of cellular biophysics and biochemistry. Specifically, 4pi fluorescence microscopy technique stands out because of its axial super-resolution capability. All types of 4pi-microscopy techniques work well in conjugation with deconvolution techniques to get rid of artifacts due to side-lobes. In this regard, we propose a technique based on spatial filter in a 4pi-type-C confocal setup to get rid of these artifacts. Using a special spatial filter, we have reduced the depth-of-focus. Interference of two similar depth-of-focus beams in a 4π geometry result in substantial reduction of side-lobes. Studies show a reduction of side-lobes by 46% and 76% for single and two photon variant compared to 4pi - type - C confocal system. This is incredible considering the resolving capability of the existing 4pi - type - C confocal microscopy. Moreover, the main lobe is found to be 150 nm for the proposed spatial filtering technique as compared to 690 nm of the state-of-art confocal system. Reconstruction of experimentally obtained 2PE - 4pi data of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mitocondrial network shows near elimination of artifacts arising out of side-lobes. Proposed technique may find interesting application in fluorescence microscopy, nano-lithography, and cell biology.

TITLE: Analysis of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion using an enzymatic cell fusion assay.

PMID: 23117158
DOI: 10.3791/4378

ABSTRACT:
The interactions of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins on vesicles (v-SNAREs) and on target membranes (t-SNAREs) catalyze intracellular vesicle fusion(1-4). Reconstitution assays are essential for dissecting the mechanism and regulation of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion(5). In a cell fusion assay(6,7), SNARE proteins are expressed ectopically at the cell surface. These "flipped" SNARE proteins drive cell-cell fusion, demonstrating that SNAREs are sufficient to fuse cellular membranes. Because the cell fusion assay is based on microscopic analysis, it is less efficient when used to analyze multiple v- and t-SNARE interactions quantitatively. Here we describe a new assay(8) that quantifies SNARE-mediated cell fusion events by activated expression of β-galactosidase. Two components of the Tet-Off gene expression system(9) are used as a readout system: the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) and a reporter plasmid that encodes the LacZ gene under control of the tetracycline-response element (TRE-LacZ). We transfect tTA into COS-7 cells that express flipped v-SNARE proteins at the cell surface (v-cells) and transfect TRE-LacZ into COS-7 cells that express flipped t-SNARE proteins at the cell surface (t-cells). SNARE-dependent fusion of the v- and t-cells results in the binding of tTA to TRE, the transcriptional activation of LacZ and expression of β-galactosidase. The activity of β-galactosidase is quantified using a colorimetric method by absorbance at 420 nm. The vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) are v-SNAREs that reside in various post-Golgi vesicular compartments(10-15). By expressing VAMPs 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 at the same level, we compare their membrane fusion activities using the enzymatic cell fusion assay. Based on spectrometric measurement, this assay offers a quantitative approach for analyzing SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and for high-throughput studies.

TITLE: Studying proteolysis of cyclin B at the single cell level in whole cell populations.

PMID: 23007658

ABSTRACT:
Equal distribution of chromosomes between the two daughter cells during cell division is a prerequisite for guaranteeing genetic stability. Inaccuracies during chromosome separation are a hallmark of malignancy and associated with progressive disease. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a mitotic surveillance mechanism that holds back cells at metaphase until every single chromosome has established a stable bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. The SAC exerts its function by interference with the activating APC/C subunit Cdc20 to block proteolysis of securin and cyclin B and thus chromosome separation and mitotic exit. Improper attachment of chromosomes prevents silencing of SAC signaling and causes continued inhibition of APC/C(Cdc20) until the problem is solved to avoid chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and malignant growths. Most studies that addressed the influence of improper chromosomal attachment on APC/C-dependent proteolysis took advantage of spindle disruption using depolymerizing or microtubule-stabilizing drugs to interfere with chromosomal attachment to microtubules. Since interference with microtubule kinetics can affect the transport and localization of critical regulators, these procedures bear a risk of inducing artificial effects. To study how the SAC interferes with APC/C-dependent proteolysis of cyclin B during mitosis in unperturbed cell populations, we established a histone H2-GFP-based system which allowed the simultaneous monitoring of metaphase alignment of mitotic chromosomes and proteolysis of cyclin B. To depict proteolytic profiles, we generated a chimeric cyclin B reporter molecule with a C-terminal SNAP moiety (Figure 1). In a self-labeling reaction, the SNAP-moiety is able to form covalent bonds with alkylguanine-carriers (SNAP substrate) (Figure 1). SNAP substrate molecules are readily available and carry a broad spectrum of different fluorochromes. Chimeric cyclin B-SNAP molecules become labeled upon addition of the membrane-permeable SNAP substrate to the growth medium (Figure 1). Following the labeling reaction, the cyclin B-SNAP fluorescence intensity drops in a pulse-chase reaction-like manner and fluorescence intensities reflect levels of cyclin B degradation (Figure 1). Our system facilitates the monitoring of mitotic APC/C-dependent proteolysis in large numbers of cells (or several cell populations) in parallel. Thereby, the system may be a valuable tool to identify agents/small molecules that are able to interfere with proteolytic activity at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Moreover, as synthesis of cyclin B during mitosis has recently been suggested as an important mechanism in fostering a mitotic block in mice and humans by keeping cyclin B expression levels stable, this system enabled us to analyze cyclin B proteolysis as one element of a balanced equilibrium.

TITLE: Purification and aggregation of the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain.
AUTHORS: El Ayadi Amina, Stieren Emily S, Barral José M, Oberhauser Andres F, Boehning Darren
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2012)
PMID: 22952038

ABSTRACT:
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP is characterized by a large extracellular domain and a short cytosolic domain termed the APP intracellular domain (AICD). During maturation through the secretory pathway, APP can be cleaved by proteases termed α, β, and γ-secretases. Sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP with β and γ-secretases leads to the production of a small proteolytic peptide, termed Aβ, which is amyloidogenic and the core constituent of senile plaques. The AICD is also liberated from the membrane after secretase processing, and through interactions with Fe65 and Tip60, can translocate to the nucleus to participate in transcription regulation of multiple target genes. Protein-protein interactions involving the AICD may affect trafficking, processing, and cellular functions of holo-APP and its C-terminal fragments. We have recently shown that AICD can aggregate in vitro, and this process is inhibited by the AD-implicated molecular chaperone ubiquilin-1. Consistent with these findings, the AICD has exposed hydrophobic domains and is intrinsically disordered in vitro, however it obtains stable secondary structure when bound to Fe65. We have proposed that ubiquilin-1 prevents inappropriate inter- and intramolecular interactions of AICD, preventing aggregation in vitro and in intact cells. While most studies focus on the role of APP in the pathogenesis of AD, the role of AICD in this process is not clear. Expression of AICD has been shown to induce apoptosis, to modulate signaling pathways, and to regulate calcium signaling. Over-expression of AICD and Fe65 in a transgenic mouse model induces Alzheimer's like pathology, and recently AICD has been detected in brain lysates by western blotting when using appropriate antigen retrieval techniques. To facilitate structural, biochemical, and biophysical studies of the AICD, we have developed a procedure to produce recombinantly large amounts of highly pure AICD protein. We further describe a method for inducing the in vitro thermal aggregation of AICD and analysis by atomic force microscopy. The methods described are useful for biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization of the AICD and the effects of molecular chaperones on AICD aggregation.

TITLE: Measuring fast calcium fluxes in cardiomyocytes.
AUTHORS: Golebiewska Urszula, Scarlata Suzanne
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2011)
PMID: 22143396
DOI: 10.3791/3505

ABSTRACT:
Cardiomyocytes have multiple Ca(2+) fluxes of varying duration that work together to optimize function (1,2). Changes in Ca(2+) activity in response to extracellular agents is predominantly regulated by the phospholipase Cβ- Gα(q;) pathway localized on the plasma membrane which is stimulated by agents such as acetylcholine (3,4). We have recently found that plasma membrane protein domains called caveolae(5,6) can entrap activated Gα(q;)(7). This entrapment has the effect of stabilizing the activated state of Gα(q;) and resulting in prolonged Ca(2+) signals in cardiomyocytes and other cell types(8). We uncovered this surprising result by measuring dynamic calcium responses on a fast scale in living cardiomyocytes. Briefly, cells are loaded with a fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator. In our studies, we used Ca(2+) Green (Invitrogen, Inc.) which exhibits an increase in fluorescence emission intensity upon binding of calcium ions. The fluorescence intensity is then recorded for using a line-scan mode of a laser scanning confocal microscope. This method allows rapid acquisition of the time course of fluorescence intensity in pixels along a selected line, producing several hundreds of time traces on the microsecond time scale. These very fast traces are transferred into excel and then into Sigmaplot for analysis, and are compared to traces obtained for electronic noise, free dye, and other controls. To dissect Ca(2+) responses of different flux rates, we performed a histogram analysis that binned pixel intensities with time. Binning allows us to group over 500 traces of scans and visualize the compiled results spatially and temporally on a single plot. Thus, the slow Ca(2+) waves that are difficult to discern when the scans are overlaid due to different peak placement and noise, can be readily seen in the binned histograms. Very fast fluxes in the time scale of the measurement show a narrow distribution of intensities in the very short time bins whereas longer Ca(2+) waves show binned data with a broad distribution over longer time bins. These different time distributions allow us to dissect the timing of Ca(2+)fluxes in the cells, and to determine their impact on various cellular events.

ABSTRACT:
The role of individual neurons and their function in neuronal circuits is fundamental to understanding the neuronal mechanisms of sensory and motor functions. Most investigations of sensorimotor mechanisms rely on either examination of neurons while an animal is static or record extracellular neuronal activity during a movement. While these studies have provided the fundamental background for sensorimotor function, they either do not evaluate functional information which occurs during a movement or are limited in their ability to fully characterize the anatomy, physiology and neurochemical phenotype of the neuron. A technique is shown here which allows extensive characterization of individual neurons during an in vivo movement. This technique can be used not only to study primary afferent neurons but also to characterize motoneurons and sensorimotor interneurons. Initially the response of a single neuron is recorded using electrophysiological methods during various movements of the mandible followed by determination of the receptive field for the neuron. A neuronal tracer is then intracellularly injected into the neuron and the brain is processed so that the neuron can be visualized with light, electron or confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). The detailed morphology of the characterized neuron is then reconstructed so that neuronal morphology can be correlated with the physiological response of the neuron (Figs. 2,3). In this communication important key details and tips for successful implementation of this technique are provided. Valuable additional information can be determined for the neuron under study by combining this method with other techniques. Retrograde neuronal labeling can be used to determine neurons with which the labeled neuron synapses; thus allowing detailed determination of neuronal circuitry. Immunocytochemistry can be combined with this method to examine neurotransmitters within the labeled neuron and to determine the chemical phenotypes of neurons with which the labeled neuron synapses. The labeled neuron can also be processed for electron microscopy to determine the ultrastructural features and microcircuitry of the labeled neuron. Overall this technique is a powerful method to thoroughly characterize neurons during in vivo movement thus allowing substantial insight into the role of the neuron in sensorimotor function.

TITLE: Synthesis, assembly, and characterization of monolayer protected gold nanoparticle films for protein monolayer electrochemistry.

ABSTRACT:
Colloidal gold nanoparticles protected with alkanethiolate ligands called monolayer protected gold clusters (MPCs) are synthesized and subsequently incorporated into film assemblies that serve as adsorption platforms for protein monolayer electrochemistry (PME). PME is utilized as the model system for studying electrochemical properties of redox proteins by confining them to an adsorption platform at a modified electrode, which also serves as a redox partner for electron transfer (ET) reactions. Studies have shown that gold nanoparticle film assemblies of this nature provide for a more homogeneous protein adsorption environment and promote ET without distance dependence compared to the more traditional systems modified with alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAM). In this paper, MPCs functionalized with hexanethiolate ligands are synthesized using a modified Brust reaction and characterized with ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and proton (¹H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). MPC films are assembled on SAM modified gold electrode interfaces by using a "dip cycle" method of alternating MPC layers and dithiol linking molecules. Film growth at gold electrode is tracked electrochemically by measuring changes to the double layer charging current of the system. Analogous films assembled on silane modified glass slides allow for optical monitoring of film growth and cross-sectional TEM analysis provides an estimated film thickness. During film assembly, manipulation of the MPC ligand protection as well as the interparticle linkage mechanism allow for networked films, that are readily adaptable, to interface with redox protein having different adsorption mechanism. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin (AZ) can be adsorbed hydrophobically to dithiol-linked films of hexanethiolate MPCs and cytochrome c (cyt c) can be immobilized electrostatically at a carboxylic acid modified MPC interfacial layer. In this report, we focus on the film protocol for the AZ system exclusively. Investigations involving the adsorption of proteins on MPC modified synthetic platforms could further the understanding of interactions between biomolecules and man-made materials, and consequently aid the development of biosensor schemes, ET modeling systems, and synthetic biocompatible materials.

DOI: 10.3791/1915

ABSTRACT:
We demonstrate a microscopic instrument that can measure subcellular texture arising from organelle morphology and organization within unstained living cells. The proposed instrument extends the sensitivity of label-free optical microscopy to nanoscale changes in organelle size and shape and can be used to accelerate the study of the structure-function relationship pertaining to organelle dynamics underlying fundamental biological processes, such as programmed cell death or cellular differentiation. The microscope can be easily implemented on existing microscopy platforms, and can therefore be disseminated to individual laboratories, where scientists can implement and use the proposed methods with unrestricted access. The proposed technique is able to characterize subcellular structure by observing the cell through two-dimensional optical Gabor filters. These filters can be tuned to sense with nanoscale (10's of nm) sensitivity, specific morphological attributes pertaining to the size and orientation of non-spherical subcellular organelles. While based on contrast generated by elastic scattering, the technique does not rely on a detailed inverse scattering model or on Mie theory to extract morphometric measurements. This technique is therefore applicable to non-spherical organelles for which a precise theoretical scatter description is not easily given, and provides distinctive morphometric parameters that can be obtained within unstained living cells to assess their function. The technique is advantageous compared with digital image processing in that it operates directly on the object's field transform rather than the discretized object's intensity. It does not rely on high image sampling rates and can therefore be used to rapidly screen morphological activity within hundreds of cells at a time, thus greatly facilitating the study of organelle structure beyond individual organelle segmentation and reconstruction by fluorescence confocal microscopy of highly magnified digital images of limited fields of view. In this demonstration we show data from a marine diatom to illustrate the methodology. We also show preliminary data collected from living cells to give an idea of how the method may be applied in a relevant biological context.

ABSTRACT:
The Drosophila eye is a powerful model system for studying areas such as neurogenesis, signal transduction and neurodegeneration. Many of the discoveries made using this system have taken advantage of the spatiotemporal nature of photoreceptor differentiation in the developing eye imaginal disc. To use this system it is first necessary for the researcher to learn to identify and dissect the eye disc. We describe a novel RFP reporter to aid in the identification of the eye disc and the visualization of specific cell types in the developing eye. We detail a methodology for dissection of the eye imaginal disc from third instar larvae and describe how the eye-RFP reporter can aid in this dissection. This eye-RFP reporter is only expressed in the eye and can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy either in live tissue or after fixation without the need for signal amplification. We also show how this reporter can be used to identify specific cells types within the eye disc. This protocol and the use of the eye-RFP reporter will aid researchers using the Drosophila eye to address fundamentally important biological questions.

ABSTRACT:
Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging is a widely accepted technique for imaging brain activity. We propose an integrated device consisting of interleaved arrays of gallium arsenide (GaAs) based semiconductor light sources and detectors operating at telecommunications wavelengths in the near-infrared. Such a device will allow for long-term, minimally invasive monitoring of neural activity in freely behaving subjects, and will enable the use of structured illumination patterns to improve system performance. In this work we describe the proposed system and show that near-infrared IOS imaging at wavelengths compatible with semiconductor devices can produce physiologically significant images in mice, even through skull.

ABSTRACT:
Complex cellular interactions determine functional and structural tissue remodeling during reperfused acute myocardial infarction (repAMI). These processes show distinct spatial distribution as the injured heart muscle is segmented into different areas (damage area, area at risk (AAR), and remote area). Three-dimensional (3D) visualization of these areas is essential for the analysis of various interactions between resident cardiac cells and infiltrating immune cells, enabling the identification of possible treatment targets. Here, a protocol is described for simultaneous and automatable 3D visualization and quantification of the cardiac damage area, AAR, and infiltrating immune cells (e.g., neutrophils) after repAMI. This includes intravital antibody-mediated staining of cardiac damage area (CD31neg) and neutrophil infiltration (Ly6G+) following ex vivo visualization of AAR by retrograde antibody perfusion and further non-toxic tissue clearing for light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) imaging. This technique allows the spatial analysis of target cells, e.g., infiltrating immune cells and damaged areas in an intact mouse heart after repAMI. Traditional histology and immunohistochemistry can be performed after non-toxic tissue clearing and image acquisition with computer-assisted post-processing. This allows multiplexing information gain within the same mouse heart, strengthening data robustness and being especially significant in a highly complex injury like repAMI.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) can image the position and dipole orientation of fluorophores. Despite the achievements of super-resolution fluorescence polarization microscopy, their reliance on post-acquisition hinders real-time observation. Polarized structured illumination microscopy (pSIM) offers super-resolution imaging of fluorescent dipoles with fast imaging speed and is well-suited for live-cell applications. We developed an open-source implementation for real-time reconstruction of polarization images and display of the fluorescent dipoles. Additionally, we extended the method to achieve 3D orientation mapping (3DOM), broadening its utility for complex biological studies.Furthermore, we have presented a thorough introduction to extending an existing SIM microscope on polarization imaging and provided a detailed configuration guide of Micro-Manager 2.0 to control the microscope, enabling real-time preview of polarized imaging. Additionally, we have provided the MATLAB code for full reconstructionencompassing both pSIM and 3DOM. This comprehensive guide aims to assist beginners in quickly mastering and easily getting started with the operations.

ABSTRACT:
Intravital longitudinal fluorescence microscopy imaging has emerged as a crucial technique for studying dynamic biological processes, notably in the context of tissue regeneration, tumor development, and therapeutic responses. Particularly, the calvarial bone marrow is a highly dynamic tissue, where the hematopoietic fate is interconnected with the surrounding microenvironment, with specialized vessels responding to normal and pathologic hematopoiesis. Traditional imaging of fixed tissues offers static information, often limiting a comprehensive understanding of these processes. The integration of transgenic animals expressing cell-specific markers, live cell tracers, advancements in imaging equipment, and the use of specialized chambers has elevated intravital microscopy to a pivotal tool for gaining insights into dynamic biological phenomena. One application of intravital imaging is the investigation of tumor vessel behavior and therapeutic effects. A newly designed 3D-printed titanium head fixation implant can be stably connected to the mouse skull and is suitable for longitudinal imaging during multiple sessions. The proposed protocol allows for the spatial and temporal examination of vascular dynamics in the calvarial bone marrow, including visualization and quantification of vascular heterogeneity, interaction with stromal and hematopoietic cells, and measurement of vascular functional parameters. Additionally, the technique enables the visualization of established vascular beds and the monitoring of therapeutic effects, stem cell mobilization, and the localization of chemotherapeutic compounds over time using two-photon microscopy. Overall, this intravital longitudinal imaging protocol provides a comprehensive platform for investigating both tumor vessel behavior and hematopoietic cell dynamics, offering valuable insights into the intricate processes governing these biological phenomena.

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondria are best recognized for their role in ATP synthesis and serve as key regulators of cellular metabolism. Mitochondrial dynamics comprehend the intracellular and intercellular movement of mitochondria, as well as the processes of fission/fusion. These events are fundamental to maintaining mitochondrial function by maintaining cellular homeostasis, morphology, bioenergetics, quality control, and stress responses. On the other hand, dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics impacts cellular morphology and function. Precise measurement of mitochondria fission/fusion events can be indicative of cellular health. Current methodologies to measure mitochondria dynamics employ advanced imaging like super-resolution microscopy, fluorescence techniques (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)) for connectivity, and optogenetic tools for spatiotemporal control. Quantitative analysis utilizes computational tools to measure parameters like length, number, and branching, which indicate fission/fusion balance. However, these methods require skills and sophisticated instruments. In this article, we describe the use of confocal microscopy combined with free-to-use tools in ImageJ (Fiji) to study fission/fusion events using the photo-switching property of the dendra2 protein, tagged to mitochondrial cytochrome c.

ABSTRACT:
Calcium imaging is crucial for studying neural dynamics and brain function. However, current methods for imaging calcium in Drosophila larvae are challenging due to motion artifacts and specialized equipment needs. Here, we present a practical, low-cost method for performing both in vivo and ex vivo calcium imaging in third-instar Drosophila larvae, using a topical tissue adhesive for immobilizing samples. We also provide custom R scripts and a framework for data analysis, facilitating measurements of calcium changes under different experimental conditions. Using this approach, we successfully recorded calcium transients in a pair of larval CNS neurons with minimal motion artifacts, demonstrating reproducibility across preparations. The method is compatible with standard spinning disk confocal systems and can be adapted for DIY or commercial two-photon setups, making it accessible to laboratories with different resources. This approach may increase accessibility to larval calcium imaging studies and can be adapted to examine the effects of both external stimuli, such as odors, and internal stimuli, such as neuromodulators.

ABSTRACT:
A new correlative imaging methodology combining sub-micron spatial resolution with sensitive drug detection by optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry imaging has been developed to visualise chemical distribution upon drug application in soft tissue. In this example, the method has been tested on excised skin tissue after in vitro topical application of a commercial nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug product for 16 hours. Non-destructive optical spectroscopic methods, including stimulated Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon fluorescence microscopies, were first employed to map the skin structure and morphology. Subsequently, the same skin tissue samples were analysed via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), which enabled enhanced sensitivity for the detection of diclofenac across the outermost skin layers - epidermis and dermis. Image registration methods were devised to integrate the optical and mass spectrometric data. This approach combines label-free, high-resolution visualisation of tissue structure with sensitive chemical detection, and represents a valuable tool for investigating drug distribution in skin and potentially, in other soft biological tissues.

ABSTRACT:
Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus of prematurity (PHHP) is a serious sequela of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in very preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestational age (GA). PHHP is defined by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associated with clinical symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Infants with PHHP suffer lifelong shunt dependence, with half requiring repeat surgery in the first year of life and many requiring multiple additional surgeries throughout the lifespan. Prenatal chorioamnionitis predisposes preterm infants to severe IVH and the need for surgical treatment of PHHP trends with neonatal sepsis. These clinical features suggest that systemic inflammation is an integral component of PHHP pathophysiology. Here, we define an animal model that recapitulates all clinical aspects and essential features of PHHP in rats. The goal of this protocol is to illustrate how in utero chorioamnionitis and postnatal IVH using lysed red blood cells can be combined to yield PHHP. This preclinical approach yields progressive macrocephaly and domed craniums, elevated intracranial pressure, and ventriculomegaly that can be detected via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or via microscopy. In addition to sustained disruption in CSF dynamics, rats also have cognitive delay and functional disability into adulthood. Accordingly, this preclinical platform facilitates unique and unparalleled translational studies of PHHP that can incorporate molecular, cellular, biochemical, histologic, imaging, and functional outcome measures. It can also be used for rigorous analysis of the choroid plexus, ependymal motile cilia, and glymphatic system in parallel. Last, it can also be an invaluable preclinical tool for the investigation of novel surgical intervention strategies and non-surgical therapeutic approaches for the treatment of hydrocephalus.

ABSTRACT:
The myosin super-relaxed (SRX) state is a biochemical and structural conformation of myosin that modulates contractility and energy expenditure and is in equilibrium with the disordered relaxed (DRX) state of myosin, which can hydrolyze ATP to produce force. The proportion of myosin SRX-DRX states is perturbed in various muscle disorders, and myosin SRX-DRX states have become a promising drug target. There are many approaches that can be used to interrogate myosin conformations, including X-ray diffraction, stopped-flow kinetics and electron microscopy. These techniques are highly informative but necessitate highly skilled researchers and specialist equipment, limiting wider uptake and accessibility. For this reason, we provide a set of protocols detailing established assays to measure biochemically defined myosin SRX-DRX states in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, myofibrils, reconstituted thick filaments and isolated molecular motors by using a simple chase assay incorporating a fluorescent ATP analogue: methylanthraniloyl (Mant)-ATP. The Mant-ATP assay provides a biochemical measure of myosin states that is distinct from assays that are used to visualize myosin structure directly. These Mant-ATP assays have various protocol lengths, ranging from 1-2 d for preparation and 30 min to run an experiment. With this set of protocols, we make the Mant-ATP assay accessible to those working in biochemistry, muscle physiology and cell biology. At the end of this protocol, users should be able to ascertain a clean fluorescent decay trace that can be fit to define the ratio of SRX/DRX myosin in their sample of choice.

ABSTRACT:
Regulation of proteome homeostasis is crucial for the survival and adaptation to changing environments for all species. In eukaryotes, this process is finely tuned through regulation at the level of transcription, translation, protein modification, and protein degradation. The phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA) is present in all eukaryotes and believed to be a key player in ubiquitin-dependent protein sorting and degradation via its interactions with ubiquitin and/or the AAA+ ATPase, valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97). PLAA's molecular targets and interaction network remain unclear. We used Caenorhabditis elegans and unbiased proteome-scale approaches to investigate neuronal specific interactors of the C. elegans PLAA ortholog UFD-3 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 3), its effect on ubiquitinated proteins, and global protein expression changes in an ufd-3 mutant. We found that PLAA may play a unique role in cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) processing bodies (P-bodies). Using biochemical analysis in vitro and fluorescence imaging in C. elegans, we show that UFD-3 directly interacts with the mRNA decapping complex regulatory subunit DCAP-1. UFD-3's intrinsic disordered region (IDR), which contains conserved amino acid motifs, is important for the recruitment of DCAP-1 to P-bodies. Finally, we show that loss of the IDR does not affect UFD-3's role in sorting ubiquitinated proteins through the multivesicular body pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that UFD-3's role in P-bodies is distinct from its role in the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway and the IDR is only critical for UFD-3-regulated P-bodies pathways. Thus, PLAA/UFD-3 might regulate the proteome via two distinct pathways: ubiquitinated protein turnover, as well as mRNA regulation through P-bodies.

ABSTRACT:
Imaging actin-dependent processes in live cells is important for understanding numerous biological processes. However, currently used natural-product-based fluorescent probes for actin filaments affect the dynamics of actin polymerization and can induce undesired cellular phenotypes. Here, we introduce SiR-XActin, a simplified jasplakinolide-based, far-red fluorescent probe that enables bright and photostable staining in various cell types without requiring genetic modifications. Due to its relatively weak binding affinity, the probe exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and labels actin filaments without significantly altering actin dynamics. Furthermore, SiR-XActin is suitable for time-resolved, live-cell super-resolution STED microscopy. Exchanging the SiR fluorophore in SiR-XActin for other fluorophores yields probes in different colors. All these properties make SiR-XActin and its analogs powerful tools for studying actin dynamics using live-cell fluorescence microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
High light-throughput microscopy stands as a potent tool in biological research, spanning applications from cell functional analysis to brain science. The pursuit of achieving elevated light throughput alongside rapid imaging speeds without the need for additional optical hardware has emerged as a pivotal focus in biomedical research. To address this challenge, we introduced a cutting-edge framework known as the deep learning-based layer predictor (DLLP). By integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the inter-layer dynamic and morphological attention mechanism (IDMA) within a transformer architecture, DLLP employed a tomographic prediction technique capable of reducing the number of scanning layers in three-dimensional (3D) microscopy by over 70%, while maintaining light throughput and image fidelity. The DLLP framework significantly improved imaging speed and quality through two complementary strategies: robust unsupervised denoising to effectively mitigate electrical noise in the xy-plane caused by faster imaging and sparse recovery along the Z-axis to ensure high-quality 3D reconstruction without compromising spatial resolution. The DLLP framework has demonstrated consistent performance across various microscopy modalities, including stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, fluorescence modulation optical sectioning tomography (FMOST) microscopy, multi-photon microscopy, and light-sheet microscopy, surpassing traditional methods and existing deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy and image quality.

ABSTRACT:
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are critical in cellular communication and pathological biomarkers. Post-translationally deiminated/citrullinated proteins are reported in EV cargoes by LC-MS/MS but it is unknown in which EV sub-types they are exported, as part of EVs' intraluminal cargo or on the EV surface. Here, dSTORM super-resolution microscopy is used to co-localise total citrullinated proteins (pan-Cit), and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) to EV subtypes of three cancer cell lines, captured by tetraspanin trio (TT) or phosphatidylserine (PS). Permeabilised and non-permeabilised EVs are analysed with a Bayesian framework using beta-distributed posteriors for binomial outcomes. Pan-Cit and CitH3 labelling is confirmed in EVs as intraluminal cargo and on the EV surface, with higher levels detected in the permeabilized EVs. Pan-Cit staining is higher in TT-bound EVs, but CitH3 staining higher in PS-bound EVs. This study expands the landscape of EV-associated post-translational modifications with translational potential for EV-citrullinome based liquid biopsy tools.

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) performs spectral expansion of high-frequency information encoded in stripe patterns. However, using a limited number of pattern orientations (typically three) results in a petal-like frequency spectrum, leading to structural and intensity fidelity degradation in reconstructed images. In this Letter, we propose an integrated spatial-frequency domain SIM reconstruction method that enables isotropic spectrum expansion, called ISO-SIM. ISO-SIM overcomes structural artifacts caused by an anisotropic spectral expansion in traditional SIM imaging. We demonstrate the feasibility and fidelity of ISO-SIM through simulations, Argolight slide, and live-cell imaging. ISO-SIM enhanced structural similarity and reduced the error in the mean intensity ratio at certain spatial frequencies compared to Wiener-SIM. We further applied ISO-SIM to live-cell quantitative FRET imaging. ISO-SIM-FRET ensured that the measured FRET efficiency matched the ground truth, with a 19% reduction in the standard deviation compared to Wiener-SIM-FRET, maintaining intensity fidelity and enhancing the accuracy of quantitative analysis while suppressing artifacts.

ABSTRACT:
Optineurin (OPTN), a multifunctional cytosolic protein, is recognized as an autophagy adaptor. Its association with neurodegenerative diseases, like ALS, triggered extensive research. OPTN has been found in intracellular organelles, including the mitochondria, Golgi body, endosomes, microtubules, and the nucleus. The report of mitotic defects and delayed cell division in OPTN-depleted cells prompted us to explore OPTN's exact localization in the cell that could interfere with cell division assemblies. We used three distinct human cell lines, HeLa, HEK293, and SH-SY5Y, and probed them for OPTN localization using both centrosomal (Aurora A kinase, pericentrin, PCM1, Cep170, and γ-tubulin) and mitotic spindle markers (β-tubulin). Our immunofluorescence-based detection using wide-field fluorescence, confocal, and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) placed OPTN at the centrosome, which remained associated with the centriole after duplication and their migration during mitosis. OPTN was also observed at the junction of daughter cells during cytokinesis. Our finding reveals unmapped localizations of OPTN with key cytosolic assemblies that are directly involved in cell division.

ABSTRACT:
Multifocal structured illumination microscopy (MSIM) provides a twofold resolution enhancement over the optical diffraction limit at depths of up to 50 μm in samples. This is achieved through sparse multifocal excitation patterns and digital image post-processing, making MSIM a highly advantageous technique for the three-dimensional super-resolution (SR) imaging of thick specimens. However, the spatial resolution of MSIM is inherently constrained by its underlying imaging principles. This paper presents what we believe to be a novel method that integrates SR optical fluctuation imaging based on Fourier ptychography and deconvolution (SFPD) with MSIM, termed SFPD-MSIM. Using photoblinking InP/ZnSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dot fluorescent probes for sample labeling, we demonstrate that, compared to wide-field imaging microscopy, SFPD-MSIM achieves fourfold resolution improvement. Additionally, it substantially reduces the image-acquisition time while preserving the structural integrity of the original samples. This advancement marks a major step forward in MSIM technology, providing a powerful tool for detailed structural analysis of complex and thick biological specimens.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination-based super-resolution Förster resonance energy transfer microscopy (SIM-FRET) enables the investigation of molecular structure and function in sub-diffraction regions of live cells. However, limitations in acquisition and reconstruction speeds pose challenges for fast SIM-FRET imaging. To address this, we integrated a GPU-accelerated SIM-FRET reconstruction method with a dual-channel SIM-FRET microscope, enabling near real-time image reconstruction. We optimized the cross-correlation parameter estimation algorithm (iCOR-GPU) by implementing kernel-level GPU parallel computing, reducing parameter estimation time from ∼2837 ms to ∼34.7 ms. Additionally, fine-grained timing control via FPGA improved acquisition speed from ∼249 ms to ∼66 ms. Using the dual-channel SIM-FRET microscope with iCOR-GPU, we successfully monitored mitochondrial dynamic tubulation and cristae remodeling in living MCF7 cells. SIM-FRET imaging of U2OS cells expressing ActA-G17 M demonstrated accurate FRET efficiency and acceptor-to-donor concentration ratio. With a 512 × 512 field of view, we achieved SIM-FRET image acquisition at 15 frames per second and reconstruction at 79 frames per second.

ABSTRACT:
Reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM, also known as interference reflection microscopy) and related techniques have become of wide interest to the biophysical, soft matter, and biochemistry communities owing to their exquisite sensitivity for characterizing thin films or individual nanoscopic objects adsorbed onto surfaces, or for monitoring cell-substrate interactions. Over the recent years, striking progress has been made to improve the sensitivity and the quantitative analysis of RICM. Its use in more complex environments, with spurious reflections stemming from a variety of structures in the sample, remains however challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate two optical sectioning methods that effectively reduce such background and can be readily implemented in a conventional RICM setup: line confocal detection and structured illumination microscopy. We characterize experimentally the benefits to image quality and demonstrate the use of the methods for quantitative imaging of complex biological and biomimetic samples: cellular membranes, thin organic films, biofunctional surfaces. We then discuss the benefits of each method and provide guidelines to arbitrate between sectioning and signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we provide a detailed description of our experimental setup and a home-written image acquisition and processing software that should allow the interested reader to duplicate such a setup on a home-built or commercial microscope.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) provides precise, high-resolution visualization of target biomolecules in cellular imaging. Fluorescent light-up aptamers (FLAPs) offer a versatile approach for labeling RNA of interest in live cells by binding to fluorogens through adaptive recognition. Several FLAPs can generate blinking fluorescent signals in conjunction with fluorogens, enabling single-molecule imaging of RNA in living cells. An example of this is RhoBAST, which has been successfully used for single-molecule imaging of RNA due to its fast exchange kinetics with fluorogens. However, single-molecule imaging of RNA activities regulated by proteins in living cells presents a greater challenge. Here, we introduce mDZ-RhoBAST, a nucleic acid probe, to visualize the demethylation process by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in living cells. This probe combines the 6mA-modified DNAzyme with the RhoBAST FLAP, activated by FTO, restoring the DNAzyme's cleavage activity and releasing RhoBAST to bind the target fluorogen. Our approach achieved super-resolution imaging of the demethylation process of endogenous FTO, providing real-time insights into its demethylation processes in vivo.

ABSTRACT:
Time-resolved single molecule localization microscopy (TR-SMLM) with a 2 × 2 pixel fiber optic array camera was combined with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) to obtain super-resolved fluorescence lifetime images of individual Cy3 dye molecules and individual colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The characteristic blinking and bleaching behavior of the Cy3 and the blinking behavior of the QD emitters were used as distinguishing optical characteristics to isolate them and determine their centroid locations with spatial resolution below the optical diffraction limit. TCSPC was used to characterize the fluorescence lifetime and intensity corresponding to each emitter location. The mean centroid locations of the QDs could be determined with a precision of ∼1-4 nm, and the mean centroid locations of the Cy3 molecules could be determined with a precision of ∼2-9 nm, depending on the number of photons collected during the observation time. In a super-resolved fluorescence lifetime image with a single Cy3 dye molecule and a single QD separated by ∼34 nm, the two emitters were distinguished based on the average photon arrival times with respect to the excitation laser pulse observed during time intervals when only one emitter was in the on state, ∼6 ns for Cy3 and ∼17 ns for the QD. The mean distance between the two emitters was determined with a precision of ∼8 nm. The feasibility of using this super-resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging technique to investigate QD-dye complexes that use Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and/or electron transfer to form optical biosensors is discussed.

ABSTRACT:
DNA origami nanostructures offer wide potential for controlled functionalization with molecules of interest, such as peptides, enzymes, small-molecule drugs, and fluorophores. Here, we describe a protocol for the synthesis and characterization of aptamer-modified DNA origami nanostructures that can act as a vehicle for delivering antimicrobials to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial targets in a specific and efficient manner.

TITLE: Investigation Into the Role of Reductants and Cosubstrates in Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase Thermothielavioides terrestris AA9E Binding to Cellulose by Single-Molecule Imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Cellulose-active Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases (LPMO) facilitate plant cell wall deconstruction by attacking ordered regions of cellulose. In vitro, reductants (e.g., ascorbic acid) reduce LPMOs to Cu(I)-LPMO, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) serves as co-substrate for oxidative cleavage of cellulose glycosidic bonds. Super-resolution single-molecule imaging by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize and enumerate binding events of fluorescently-labeled Thermothielavioides terrestris AA9E (TtAA9E) on highly ordered cellulose fibrils in oxygen-scavenging buffer systems. In the glucose oxidase/catalase (GODCAT) system, oxygen is converted to H2O2, then removed by catalase. Adding ascorbic acid to the GODCAT system promoted rapid binding to cellulose by TtAA9E. In contrast, absent both oxygen and H2O2 in the protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCA/PCD) oxygen-scavenging system, adding ascorbic acid nearly eliminated cellulose binding by TtAA9E. Our results suggest that in the GODCAT system, TtAA9Es are reduced by ascorbic acid and activated by H2O2, facilitating binding to cellulose. In the PCA/PCD system, reduced TtAA9Es are not activated due to the lack of H2O2, suggesting that reduced Cu(I)-TtAA9E cannot bind to cellulose without H2O2. Notably, in the PCA/PCD system with ascorbic acid, oxidized sugar release initially lagged but was observed at longer reaction times, suggesting that H2O2 could be a limiting reactant generated in situ as oxygen becomes absorbed into solution. Binding durations of LPMO to cellulose were independent of experimental conditions: ( 82% ± 6%) of cellulose-bound LPMOs resided briefly for 14 ± 2.5 s, while 16% ± 5% of the bound enzymes remained for 60 ± 9 s.

TITLE: Chromatin compaction scaling with cell size follows a power law from interphase through mitosis.

ABSTRACT:
Coordination of mitotic chromosome compaction with cell size is crucial for proper genome segregation during mitosis. During development, DNA content remains constant, but cell size changes dynamically, necessitating a mechanism that scales chromosome compaction with cell size to ensure proper chromatin segregation. In this study, we examined chromatin compaction in the developing Drosophila nervous system by analyzing the large neuronal stem cells and their smaller progeny, the ganglion mother cells. Using super-resolution 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy and quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we observed that nanoscale chromatin density during interphase scales with nuclear volume according to a power law. This scaling relationship is disrupted by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity, indicating that molecular cues rather than mechanical constraints primarily regulate chromatin compaction. Notably, this power law dependency is maintained into mitosis, but the scaling exponent decreases. This suggests a phase-separation-like transition in the biophysical state of chromatin, whereby the polymer shifts from a more expanded to a more compact configuration. Accordingly, we propose that the scaling of mitotic chromosome size relative to cell size emerges from the organizational principles of interphase chromatin, and that mitotic compaction may be governed by polymer properties modulated by changes in the chromatin-solvent environment.

ABSTRACT:
Photoswitching of luminescence at the single-molecule or single-nanoparticle level offers great potential for applications in various fields, including high-density optical memories and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Among the various luminophores employed for such applications, perovskite quantum dots show superior optoelectronic properties. However, the hybrid systems of perovskite quantum dots and photochromic molecules (diaryethenes) suffer from low stability during multiple photoswitching cycles. To adress this issue and realize photoswitching at the single-particle level for advanced applications, extensive studies on the photoswitching mechanism in these systems have been conducted. The knowledge gained from these studies has allowed for designing a stable hybrid system that can function at the single-particle level. Here we report on a hybrid system of a photochromic diarylethene having a zwitterionic anchoring moiety and red emitting perovskite quantum dots which exhibits reversible and stable photoswitching of luminescence in solution. Furthermore, photoswitching of luminescence from the perovskite quantum dots was successfully demonstrated at the single-nanoparticle level.

ABSTRACT:
Understanding the intracellular fate of nanoparticles (NPs) is essential for advancing nanomedicine, particularly in targeted drug delivery for cancer therapy. Here, we present a complementary cryogenic microscopy workflow across scales to investigate the uptake and subcellular localization of zirconyl-containing inorganic-organic hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NPs) in murine breast cancer cells. Our approach integrates cryogenic fluorescence microscopy (cryo-FM), cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryo-FIBSEM), and cryo-soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT), enabling molecular specificity, high-resolution imaging, and volumetric ultrastructural analysis in near-native cellular states. We demonstrate that the cryogenic workflow provides enough contrast and resolution across all modalities for quantifying the IOH-NP uptake: NPs are internalized within 2 h of incubation and progressively accumulate in endolysosomes over time, as confirmed by fluorescence labeling and SXT. Quantitative analysis reveals a marked increase in endolysosomal accumulation of IOH-NPs from 2 to 24 h. Our findings help to establish multimodal cryogenic microscopy as a powerful tool for nanoscale imaging and quantitative analysis of NP uptake within close-to-native cells, offering new insights into NP trafficking and cellular responses relevant to nanomedicine development.

ABSTRACT:
The R403Q mutation in the sarcomere protein beta-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) is a known genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), associated with ventricular hypercontractility, impaired relaxation, and cardiac arrhythmias. Despite extensive research, the mutations impact on myosin contractile properties remains unclear partly due to discrepancies across different model systems. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary approach to explore mutational effects using two distinct heterozygous R403Q systems: a Yucatan minipig model and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). X-ray diffraction of R403Q minipig ventricular muscle demonstrated reduced order of the thick filament, suggesting destabilization of the inhibited OFF (vs. ON) state of myosin in relaxed muscle, which correlated with elevated force at submaximal calcium. Super-resolution, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy indicated elevated ATPase activity in thick filament zones lacking cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). Furthermore, R403Q myofibrils exhibited slower activation and relaxation kinetics, with reduced sensitivity to ADP. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that altered interactions at the actomyosin interface contribute to these effects, rather than changes at the nucleotide binding pocket, typically associated with ADP release. Human engineered heterozygous R403Q hiPSC-CMs exhibited reduced maximal myofibril force, slowed relaxation kinetics, and hypercontraction in engineered heart tissue constructs-consistent with HCM phenotypes observed in the heterozygous porcine model. Our results demonstrate that the R403Q mutation induces contractile dysfunction within the early stages of stem cell derived cardiomyocyte development and in juvenile minipigs, and that hypercontractility and slower contractile kinetics may result from a combination of an increased population of activated (ON) myosin heads and delayed detachment during cross-bridge cycling, respectively.

ABSTRACT:
Reconstituted cytoskeleton composites have emerged as a valuable model system for studying non-equilibrium soft matter. The faithful capture of the dynamics of these 3D, dense networks calls for optical sectioning, which is often associated with fluorescence confocal microscopes. However, recent developments in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) have established it as a cost-effective and, at times, superior alternative. To make LSFM accessible to cytoskeleton researchers less familiar with optics, we present a step-by-step beginner's guide to building a versatile light-sheet fluorescence microscope from off-the-shelf components. To enable sample mounting with traditional slide samples, this LSFM follows the single-objective light-sheet (SOLS) design, which utilizes a single objective for both the excitation and emission collection. We describe the function of each component of the SOLS in sufficient detail to allow readers to modify the instrumentation and design it to fit their specific needs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this custom SOLS instrument by visualizing asters in kinesin-driven microtubule networks.

ABSTRACT:
Neural stem cells (NSCs) divide and produce newborn neurons in the adult brain through a process called adult neurogenesis. Adult NSCs are primarily quiescent, a reversible cell state where they have exited the cell cycle (G0) yet remain responsive to the environment. In the first step of adult neurogenesis, quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) receive a signal and activate, exiting quiescence and re-entering the cell cycle. Thus, understanding the regulators of NSC quiescence and quiescence exit is critical for future strategies targeting adult neurogenesis. However, our understanding of NSC quiescence is limited by technical constraints in identifying quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) and activated NSCs (aNSCs). This protocol describes a new approach to identify and enrich qNSCs and aNSCs generated in in vitro cultures by imaging NSC autofluorescence. First, this protocol describes how to use a confocal microscope to identify autofluorescent markers of qNSCs and aNSCs to classify NSC activation state using autofluorescence intensity. Second, this protocol describes how to use a fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) to classify NSC activation state and enrich samples for qNSCs or aNSCs using autofluorescence intensity. Third, this protocol describes how to use a multiphoton microscope to perform fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) at single-cell resolution, classify NSC activation state, and track the dynamics of quiescent exit using both autofluorescence intensities and fluorescence lifetimes. Thus, this protocol provides a live-cell, label-free, single-cell resolution toolkit for studying NSC quiescence and quiescence exit.

ABSTRACT:
The lymphatic vasculature, now often referred to as "the third circulation," is located in many vital organ systems. A principal mechanical function of the lymphatic vasculature is to return fluid from extracellular spaces back to the central venous ducts. Lymph transport is mediated by spontaneous rhythmic contractions of lymph vessels (LVs). LV contractions are largely regulated by the cyclic rise and fall of cytosolic, free calcium ([Ca2+]i). This paper presents a method to concurrently calculate changes in absolute concentrations of [Ca2+]i and vessel contractility/rhythmicity in real time in isolated, pressurized LVs. Using isolated rat mesenteric LVs, we studied changes in [Ca2+]i and contractility/rhythmicity in response to drug addition. Isolated LVs were loaded with the ratiometric Ca2+-sensing indicator Fura-2AM, and video microscopy coupled with edge-detection software was used to capture [Ca2+]i and diameter measurements continuously in real time. The Fura-2AM signal from each LV was calibrated to the minimum and maximum signal for each vessel and used to calculate absolute [Ca2+]i. Diameter measurements were used to calculate contractile parameters (amplitude, end diastolic diameter, end systolic diameter, calculated flow) and rhythmicity (frequency, contraction time, relaxation time) and correlated with absolute [Ca2+]i measurements.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE: Reducing the dimensions, when other additives are present, shows potential as a method to improve the dissolution and solubility of biopharmaceutical classification system class II drugs that have poor solubility. In this investigation, the process involved grinding naproxen with nicotinamide with the aim of improving solubility and the rate of dissolution. METHODS: Naproxen was subjected to co-milling with urea, dimethylurea, and nicotinamide using a planetary ball mill for a duration of 90 min, maintaining a 1:1 molar ratio for the excipients (screening studies). The co-milled combinations, naproxen in its pure milled form, and a physical mixture were subjected to analysis using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and solubility assessment. The mixture displaying the highest solubility (naproxen-nicotinamide) was chosen for further investigation, involving testing for intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) after co-milling for both 90 and 480 min. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The co-milled combination, denoted as S-3b and consisting of the most substantial ratio of nicotinamide to naproxen at 1:3, subjected to 480 min of milling, exhibited a remarkable 45-fold increase in solubility and a 9-fold increase in IDR. XRPD analysis of the co-milled samples demonstrated no amorphization, while SEM images portrayed the aggregates of naproxen with nicotinamide. FTIR outcomes negate the presence of any chemical interactions between the components. The co-milled sample exhibiting the highest solubility and IDR was used to create a tablet, which was then subjected to comprehensive evaluation for standard attributes. The results revealed improved compressibility and dissolution properties.

ABSTRACT:
Biological sciences are increasingly uncovering the foundations of life in greater detail, made possible by the development of research methods enabling exploration at the nanometer scale. Optical microscopy, a field with a significant contribution to current knowledge, is inherently limited by the Abbe limit, stemming from the fundamental wave properties of light. Through the efforts of scientists, this limit can be circumvented, as evidenced by STED and MINFLUX techniques. STED allows imaging with a resolution down to 40 nm, while MINFLUX enables resolution as fine as 2 nm. Both techniques require labelling of biological molecular targets with fluorescent markers and enable imaging in living cells, facilitating the study of dynamic biological processes. This article provides an introduction to super-resolution techniques STED and MINFLUX, demonstrating their utility through the example of studying kinesin movement along microtubules using the MINFLUX technique. Nauki biologiczne w coraz większym szczególe odkrywają podstawy życia. Jest to między innymi możliwe przez rozwój metod badawczych, które umożliwiają poznawanie świata w skali nanometrowej. Mikroskopia optyczna, dziedzina mająca ogromny wkład w aktualny stan wiedzy, w swojej rozdzielczości jest ograniczona limitem Abbego. Limit ten wynika z fundamentalnych właściwości falowych światła. Dzięki staraniom naukowców, limit ten można obejść, czego dowodem są techniki STED oraz MINFLUX. Technika STED umożliwia obrazowanie z rozdzielczością do 40 nm, natomiast technika MINFLUX pozwala na osiągnięcie rozdzielczości nawet 2 nm. Obydwie techniki wymagają oznakowania biologicznych celów molekularnych znacznikami fluorescencyjnymi i umożliwiają obrazowanie w żywych komórkach. To umożliwia badanie dynamicznych procesów biologicznych. Artykuł zawiera wprowadzenie do technik super-rozdzielczych STED oraz MINFLUX, a ich użyteczność została przedstawiona na przykładzie badań ruchu kinezyny po mikrotubulach techniką MINFLUX.

ABSTRACT:
Quantifying the number of molecules from fluorescence microscopy measurements is an important topic in cell biology and medical research. In this work, we present a consecutive algorithm for super-resolution (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) scanning microscopy that provides molecule counts in automatically generated image segments and offers statistical guarantees in form of asymptotic confidence intervals. To this end, we first apply a multiscale scanning procedure on STED microscopy measurements of the sample to obtain a system of significant regions, each of which contains at least one molecule with prescribed uniform probability. This system of regions will typically be highly redundant and consists of rectangular building blocks. To choose an informative but non-redundant subset of more naturally shaped regions, we hybridize our system with the result of a generic segmentation algorithm. The diameter of the segments can be of the order of the resolution of the microscope. Using multiple photon coincidence measurements of the same sample in confocal mode, we are then able to estimate the brightness and number of molecules and give uniform confidence intervals on the molecule counts for each previously constructed segment. In other words, we establish a so-called molecular map with uniform error control. The performance of the algorithm is investigated on simulated and real data.

ABSTRACT:
Spectrally-resolved single-molecule localization microscopy (srSMLM) has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the spectral properties of single emitters in localization microscopy. By simultaneously capturing the spatial positions and spectroscopic signatures of individual fluorescent molecules, srSMLM opens up the possibility of investigating an additional dimension in super-resolution imaging. However, appropriate and dedicated tools are required to fully capitalize on the spectral dimension. Here, we propose the application of the spectral phasor analysis as an effective method for summarizing and analyzing the spectral information obtained from srSMLM experiments. The spectral phasor condenses the complete spectrum of a single emitter into a two-dimensional space, preserving key spectral characteristics for single-molecule spectral exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral phasor in efficiently classifying single Nile Red fluorescence emissions from largely overlapping cyanine fluorescence signals in dual-color PAINT experiments. Additionally, we employed spectral phasor with srSMLM to reveal subtle alterations occurring in the membrane of Gram-positive Enterococcus hirae in response to gramicidin exposure, a membrane-perturbing antibiotic treatment. Spectral phasor provides a robust, model-free analytic tool for the detailed analysis of the spectral component of srSMLM, enhancing the capabilities of multi-color spectrally-resolved single-molecule imaging.

ABSTRACT:
One of the most popular single-molecule approaches in biological science is single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, which will be the subject of the following section of this volume. Fluorescence methods provide the sensitivity required to study biology on the single-molecule level, but they also allow access to useful measurable parameters on time and length scales relevant for the biomolecular world. Before several detailed experimental approaches will be addressed, we will first give a general overview of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. We start with discussing the phenomenon of fluorescence in general and the history of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Next, we will review fluorescent probes in more detail and the equipment required to visualize them on the single-molecule level. We will end with a description of parameters measurable with such approaches, ranging from protein counting and tracking, single-molecule localization super-resolution microscopy, to distance measurements with Förster resonance energy transfer and orientation measurements with fluorescence polarization.

ABSTRACT:
Accidental wounding of the peripheral nervous system leads to acute neural dysfunction. Normally, chronic deficits are overcome because peripheral nerves naturally regenerate. However, various genetic and metabolic defects can impair their natural regenerative capacity, which may be due to neuron-extrinsic mechanisms. Therefore, characterizing the behavior of multiple cells during nerve injury and repair in vivo is a pressing need in regenerative medicine. Here, we detail a method for precise wounding of sensory axons in zebrafish, followed by high-resolution in toto long-term quantitative videomicroscopy of neurons, Schwann cells, and macrophages. This protocol can be easily adapted to study the effects of targeted genetic or metabolic disruptions in zebrafish and other suitable organisms, as well as for screening pharmacological agents with therapeutic potential.

ABSTRACT:
In situ cellular cryotomography is a powerful technique for studying complex objects in their native frozen-hydrated cellular context, making it highly relevant to cellular biology and virology. The potential of combining cryotomography with other microscopy modalities makes it a perfect technique for integrative and correlative imaging. However, sample preparation for in situ cellular tomography is not straightforward, as cells do not readily attach and stretch over the electron microscopy grid. Additionally, the grids themselves are fragile and can break if handled too forcefully, resulting in the loss of imageable areas. The geometry of tissue culture dishes can also pose a challenge when manipulating the grids with tweezers. Here, we describe the tips and tricks to overcome these (and other) challenges and prepare good-quality samples for in situ cellular cryotomography and correlative imaging of adherent mammalian cells. With continued advances in cryomicroscopy technology, this technique holds enormous promise for advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.

TITLE: Unveiling the Nanoscale Dynamics of the Exocytic Machinery in Chromaffin Cells with Single-Molecule Imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Neuronal and hormonal communication relies on the exocytic fusion of vesicles containing neurotransmitters and hormones with the plasma membrane. This process is tightly regulated by key protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions and culminates in the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex formation and zippering that promotes vesicular fusion. Located on both sides of the vesicle and the plasma membrane, the zippering of the SNARE complex acts to overcome the energy barrier afforded by the repulsive electrostatic force stemming from apposing two negatively charged phospholipid membranes. Another component opposing the timely organization of the fusion machinery is thermal Brownian energy that tends to homogenize all cellular molecules by constantly switching their motions and directions through short-lived molecular interactions. Much less is known of the mechanisms counteracting these chaotic forces, allowing seamless cellular functions such as exocytic fusion. Super-resolution microscopy techniques such as single-molecule imaging have proven useful to start uncovering these nanoscale mechanisms. Here, we used single-particle tracking photoactivatable localization microscopy (sptPALM) to track syntaxin-1-mEos, a SNARE protein located on the plasma membrane of cultured bovine chromaffin cells. We demonstrate that syntaxin-1-mEos undergoes dramatic change in its mobility in response to secretagogue stimulation leading to increased nanoclustering. These nanoclusters are transient in nature and likely to provide docked vesicles with a molecular environment conducive to exocytic fusion.

ABSTRACT:
Optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy are powerful methods for investigating the mechanical and structural properties of biomolecules and for studying the dynamics of the biomolecular processes that these molecules are involved in. Here we provide an outline of the concurrent use of optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy for analyzing biomolecular processes. In particular, we focus on the use of super-resolution microscopy in optical tweezers, which allows visualization of molecules at the higher molecular densities that are typically encountered in living systems. We provide specific details on the alignment procedures of the optical pathways for confocal fluorescence microscopy and 1D-STED microscopy and elaborate on how to diagnose and correct optical aberrations and STED phase plate misalignments.

ABSTRACT:
The formation of spheroids with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), mesenchymal bodies (MBs), is usually performed using bioreactors or conventional well plates. While these methods promote the formation of a large number of spheroids, they provide limited control over their structure or over the regulation of their environment. It has therefore been hard to elucidate the mechanisms orchestrating the structural organization and the induction of the trophic functions of MBs until now. We have recently demonstrated an integrated droplet-based microfluidic platform for the high-density formation and culture of MBs, as well as for the quantitative characterization of the structural and functional organization of cells within them. The protocol starts with a suspension of a few hundred MSCs encapsulated within microfluidic droplets held in capillary traps. After droplet immobilization, MSCs start clustering and form densely packed spherical aggregates that display a tight size distribution. Quantitative imaging is used to provide a robust demonstration that human MSCs self-organize in a hierarchical manner, by taking advantage of the good fit between the microfluidic chip and conventional microscopy techniques. Moreover, the structural organization within the MBs is found to correlate with the induction of osteo-endocrine functions (i.e., COX-2 and VEGF-A expression). Therefore, the present platform provides a unique method to link the structural organization in MBs to their functional properties. Graphic abstract: Droplet microfluidic platform for integrated formation, culture, and characterization of mesenchymal bodies (MBs). The device is equipped with a droplet production area (flow focusing) and a culture chamber that enables the culture of 270 MBs in parallel. A layer-by-layer analysis revealed a hierarchical developmental organization within MBs.

TITLE: AIMTOR, a BRET Biosensor for Live Recording of mTOR Activity in Cell Populations and Single Cells.

ABSTRACT:
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls many crucial cellular functions, including protein synthesis, cell size, energy metabolism, lysosome and mitochondria biogenesis, and autophagy. Consequently, deregulation of mTOR signaling plays a role in numerous pathological conditions such as cancer, metabolic disorders and neurological diseases. Developing new tools to monitor mTOR spatiotemporal activation is crucial to better understand its roles in physiological and pathological conditions. However, the most widely used method to report mTOR activity relies on the quantification of specific mTOR-phosphorylated substrates by western blot. This approach requires cellular lysate preparation, which restricts the quantification to a single time point. Here, we present a simple protocol to study mTOR activity in living cells in real time using AIMTOR, an intramolecular BRET-based (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) biosensor that we recently designed ( Bouquier et al., 2020 ). We describe transfection of AIMTOR in the C2C12 cell line and procedures to monitor BRET in a cell population using a plate reader and in single cells by microscopy. Importantly, this protocol is transposable to any cell line and primary cells. In addition, several subcellular compartment-specific versions of AIMTOR have been developed, enabling compartmentalized assessment of mTOR activity. This protocol describes how to use the sensitive AIMTOR biosensor to investigate mTOR signaling dynamics in living cells.

TITLE: Bacterial Adhesion Kinetics in a High Throughput Setting in Seconds-minutes Time Resolution.
AUTHORS: Shteindel Nimrod, Gerchman Yoram
JOURNAL: Bio-protocol (2021)
PMID: 33778099
DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.3844

ABSTRACT:
Bacterial surface adhesion, the first step in many important processes including biofilm formation and tissue invasion, is a fast process that occurs on a time scale of seconds. Adhesion patterns tend to be stochastic and spatially heterogeneous, especially when bacteria are present in low population densities and at early stages of adhesion to the surface. Thus, in order to observe this process, a high degree of temporal resolution is needed across a large surface area in a way that allows several replicates to be monitored. Some of the current methods used to measure bacterial adhesion include microscopy, staining-based microtiter assays, spectroscopy, and PCR. Each of these methods has advantages in assaying aspects of bacterial surface adhesion, but none can capture all features of the process. In the protocol presented here, adapted from Shteindel et al., 2019 , fluorescently-labeled bacteria are monitored in a multi-titer setting using a standard plate fluorimeter and a dye that absorbs light in the fluorophore excitation and emission wavelengths. The advantage of using this dye is that it restricts the depth of the optic layer to the few microns adjacent to the bottom of the microtiter well, eliminating fluorescence originating from unattached bacteria. Another advantage of this method is that this setting does not require any preparatory steps, which enables reading of the sample to be repeated or continuous. The use of a standard multi-titer well allows easy manipulation and provides flexibility in experimental design.

DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.3993

ABSTRACT:
Experimental results in fungal biology research are usually obtained as average measurements across whole populations of cells, whilst ignoring what is happening at the single cell level. Microscopy has allowed us to study single-cell behavior, but it has low throughput and cannot be used to select individual cells for downstream experiments. Here we present a method that allows for the analysis and selection of single fungal cells in high throughput by flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), respectively. This protocol can be adapted for every fungal species that produces cells of up to 70 microns in diameter. After initial setting of the flow cytometry gates, which takes a single day, accurate single cell analysis and sorting can be performed. This method yields a throughput of thousands of cells per second. Selected cells can be subjected to downstream experiments to study single-cell behavior.

ABSTRACT:
The identification of cellular changes that accompany immune activation has been a long-standing interest for immunologists. Among these, alterations in the metabolic states of these cells have gained particular attention in the last decade due to the emergence of the field of immunometabolism. A thorough investigation of these metabolic changes can only be achieved with an in-depth visualization of mitochondrial organization; however, current strategies for mitochondrial imaging have been optimized in model cells with a high cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio and thus are not readily adaptable for many immune cells. Here, we devised a multicolor high-resolution microscopy strategy to image mitochondrial morphology in lymphocytes at both their resting and activated states. Our method allowed us to stain both the mitochondrial surface (by targeting TOM-20) and the mitochondrial matrix (through the use of Mitotracker dyes) while efficiently excluding nonviable cells. Our novel imaging strategy offers a powerful tool to study changes in mitochondrial morphology and complements any research focusing on lymphocyte metabolism.

ABSTRACT:
Cleavable Affinity Purification (Cl-AP) uses a tripartite system of Protein-A-Streptavidin beads and nanobodies, coupled with a biotinylated, thiol-cleavable linker, providing one-step affinity purification from lysates of tissues expressing tagged proteins. This technique allows fluorescent versions of mitotic protein complexes to be isolated intact from cells, for use in biophysical and microscopy-based assays, overcoming the traditional limitations of reductionist approaches. We have used this technique successfully to purify both GFP-tagged and mCherry-tagged proteins, and their interacting partners, expressed in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Although we demonstrate the efficacy of the GFP-binding protein and RFP-binding protein nanobodies from Chromotek, in theory any antibody could be coupled to the beads and used as a Cl-AP reagent.

PMID: 33659497
DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.3848

ABSTRACT:
Immunohistochemistry is a widely used technique to examine the expression and subcellular localization of proteins. This technique relies on the specificity of antibodies and requires adequate penetration of antibodies into tissues. The latter is especially challenging for thick specimens, such as embryos and other whole-mount preparations. Here we describe an improved method of immunohistochemistry for retinal whole-mount preparations. We report that a cocktail of three reagents, Triton X-100, Tween-20, and DMSO, in blocking and antibody dilution buffers strongly enhances immunolabeling in whole-mount retinas from adult zebrafish. In addition, we establish that in whole retinal tissues, a classic epitope retrieval method, based on citrate buffer, is effective for immunolabeling membrane-associated proteins. Overall, this simple modification allows precise and reproducible immunolabeling of proteins in retinal whole-mounts.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence microscopy is currently one of the more powerful and versatile techniques available for biological studies. With conventional biological immunofluorescence microscopy, caveolin-1 (CAV1) is visualized as numerous small dots, which are often distributed as a linear array or along the edge of the cell. Although its presence, as well as that of other proteins, can be detected by conventional immunofluorescence microscopy, those results do not clarify whether two different proteins exist in the plasma membrane of a specimen or how they are distributed two-dimensionally. Here, we describe an unroofing procedure that clearly reveals CAV1 localization in a single plane of the plasma membrane and also demonstrate a super-resolution structured illumination microscopy technique for observation of CAV1 in the plasma membrane.

DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.3357

ABSTRACT:
Neutrophils are critical immune cells that protect our body against invading pathogens. They generate antibacterial DNA structures called neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Recently we identified a new mechanism that enables NET formation. We observed that following recognition of lipopolysaccharides, inflammatory caspases cleave Gasdermin D and enable NET generation ( Chen et al., 2018 ). This protocol describes how we purify neutrophil nuclei to visualize NET formation by live microscopy. After neutrophil purification from murine bone marrow, neutrophils are lysed in a hypotonic buffer using a nitrogen cavitation device to prevent lysis of neutrophil granules and subsequent contamination by granules proteases. Lysed neutrophils are then centrifuged, and nuclei are counted. The protocol described here is straightforward and enables the study of early changes happening in the nuclei of neutrophils undergoing NETosis with limited contamination by granule proteases.

ABSTRACT:
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been identified as an important component for tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to cancer therapies. However, tumor-associated macrophages can be harmful to the tumor depending on the tumor microenvironment and can reversibly alter their phenotypic characteristics by either antagonizing the cytotoxic activity of immune cells or enhancing anti-tumor response. The molecular actions of macrophages and their interactions with tumor cells (e.g., phagocytosis) have not been extensively studied. Therefore, the interaction between immune cells (M1/M2-subtype TAM) and cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment is now a focus of cancer immunotherapy research. In the present study, a live cell coculture model of induced M1 macrophages and mouse mammary 4T1 carcinoma cells was developed to assess the phagocytic activity of macrophages using a time-lapse video feature using phase-contrast, fluorescent, and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. The present method can observe and document multipoint live-cell imaging of phagocytosis. Phagocytosis of 4T1 cells by M1 macrophages can be observed using fluorescent microscopy before staining 4T1 cells with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE). The current publication describes how to coculture macrophages and tumor cells in a single imaging dish, polarize M1 macrophages, and record multipoint events of macrophages engulfing 4T1 cells during 13 h of coculture.

ABSTRACT:
In vivo imaging, meaning imaging tissues in living animals, is still a developing technique. However, microscopy imaging ex vivo remains a very important tool that allows for visualization of biological and pathological processes occurring in vivo. As described in Chap. 5, imaging of animal and human tissue postmortem can be performed at high resolution. Recently, imaging of human tissues infected with pneumococci using an even higher resolution, the so-called super-resolution with STED, has been reported.

ABSTRACT:
The recent development of 3D electron microscopic techniques for cells and tissues has necessitated the development of new methods for the detection of proteins and protein-complexes in situ. The development of new genetic tags, such as the ascorbate peroxidase, APEX, for electron microscopic detection of tagged proteins has expanded the available toolbox and ushered in a new era in biological electron microscopy. Here, we describe methods for combining conditionally-stable nanobodies to fluorescent protein tags with APEX-based detection. These methods are compatible with detection of low levels of expression of fluorescently-tagged proteins and with detection of protein complexes using split GFP-based complementation methods. We describe a simple protocol for applying these methods to the electron microscopic detection of proteins and protein complexes in cultured cells.

ABSTRACT:
This protocol describes the use of in vitro television microscopy to evaluate vascular function in isolated cerebral resistance arteries (and other vessels), and describes techniques for evaluating tissue perfusion using Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) and microvessel density utilizing fluorescently labeled Griffonia simplicifolia (GS1) lectin. Current methods for studying isolated resistance arteries at transmural pressures encountered in vivo and in the absence of parenchymal cell influences provide a critical link between in vivo studies and information gained from molecular reductionist approaches that provide limited insight into integrative responses at the whole animal level. LDF and techniques to selectively identify arterioles and capillaries with fluorescently-labeled GS1 lectin provide practical solutions to enable investigators to extend the knowledge gained from studies of isolated resistance arteries. This paper describes the application of these techniques to gain fundamental knowledge of vascular physiology and pathology in the rat as a general experimental model, and in a variety of specialized genetically engineered "designer" rat strains that can provide important insight into the influence of specific genes on important vascular phenotypes. Utilizing these valuable experimental approaches in rat strains developed by selective breeding strategies and new technologies for producing gene knockout models in the rat, will expand the rigor of scientific premises developed in knockout mouse models and extend that knowledge to a more relevant animal model, with a well understood physiological background and suitability for physiological studies because of its larger size.

ABSTRACT:
Micro-electronic devices often undergo significant self-heating when biased to their typical operating conditions. This paper describes a convenient optical micro-imaging technique which can be used to map and quantify such behavior. Europium thenoyltrifluoroacetonate (EuTFC) has a 612 nm luminescence line whose activation efficiency drops strongly with increasing temperature, due to T-dependent interactions between the Eu3+ ion and the organic chelating compound. This material may be readily coated on to a sample surface by thermal sublimation in vacuum. When the coating is excited with ultraviolet light (337 nm) an optical micro-image of the 612 nm luminescent response can be converted directly into a map of the sample surface temperature. This technique offers spatial resolution limited only by the microscope optics (about 1 micron) and time resolution limited by the speed of the camera employed. It offers the additional advantages of only requiring comparatively simple and non-specialized equipment, and giving a quantitative probe of sample temperature.

TITLE: Orientational Transition in a Liquid Crystal Triggered by the Thermodynamic Growth of Interfacial Wetting Sheets.
AUTHORS: Aya Satoshi, Araoka Fumito
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2017)
PMID: 28570532
DOI: 10.3791/55729

ABSTRACT:
In liquid crystal (LC) physical chemistry, molecules near the surface play a great role in controlling bulk orientation. Thus far, mainly to achieve desired molecular orientation states in LC displays, the "static" surface property of LCs, so-called surface anchoring, has been intensively studied. As a rule of thumb, once the initial orientation of LCs is "locked" by specific surface treatments, such as rubbing or treatment with a specific alignment layer, it hardly changes with temperature. Here, we present a system exhibiting an orientational transition upon temperature variation, which conflicts with the consensus. Right on the transition, the bulk LC molecules experience the orientational rotation, with 90° between the planar (P) orientation at high temperatures and the vertical (V) orientation at low temperatures in the first-order transitional manner. We have tracked thermodynamic surface anchoring behavior by means of polarizing optical microscopy (POM), dielectric spectroscopy (DS), high-resolution differential scanning calorimetry (HR-DSC), and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and reached a plausible physical explanation: that the transition is triggered by a growth of surface wetting sheets, which impose the V orientation locally against the P orientation in the bulk. This landscape would provide a general link explaining how the equilibrium bulk orientation is affected by surface-localized orientation in many LC systems. In our characterization, POM and DS are advantageous by offering information on the spatial distribution of the orientation of LC molecules. HR-DSC gives information about the precise thermodynamic information on transitions, which cannot be addressed by conventional DSC instruments due to limited resolution. GI-XRD provides information on surface-specific molecular orientation and short-range orderings. The goal of this paper is to present a protocol for preparing a sample that exhibits the transition and to demonstrate how the thermodynamic structural variation, both in the bulk and on surfaces, can be analyzed through the abovementioned methods.

The results of studies in which the etching current and the molarity of the NaOH solution used in the etching process were varied are presented. The investigation of the geometry of the tips, by imaging them with a scanning electron microscope, and by operating them in field emission mode is also described. The field emission tips produced are intended to be used as an electron beam source for ion production via electron impact ionization of background gas or vapor in Penning trap mass spectrometry applications.

ABSTRACT:
Amphiphilic molecules equipped with a reactive, carbon-rich "oligoyne" segment consisting of conjugated carbon-carbon triple bonds self-assemble into defined aggregates in aqueous media and at the air-water interface. In the aggregated state, the oligoynes can then be carbonized under mild conditions while preserving the morphology and the embedded chemical functionalization. This novel approach provides direct access to functionalized carbon nanomaterials. In this article, we present a synthetic approach that allows us to prepare hexayne carboxylate amphiphiles as carbon-rich siblings of typical fatty acid esters through a series of repeated bromination and Negishi-type cross-coupling reactions. The obtained compounds are designed to self-assemble into monolayers at the air-water interface, and we show how this can be achieved in a Langmuir trough. Thus, compression of the molecules at the air-water interface triggers the film formation and leads to a densely packed layer of the molecules. The complete carbonization of the films at the air-water interface is then accomplished by cross-linking of the hexayne layer at room temperature, using UV irradiation as a mild external stimulus. The changes in the layer during this process can be monitored with the help of infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy and Brewster angle microscopy. Moreover, a transfer of the carbonized films onto solid substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique has enabled us to prove that they were carbon nanosheets with lateral dimensions on the order of centimeters.

ABSTRACT:
We present a template-free method for "polymerizing" nanoparticles into long chains without side branches. A variety of nanoparticles are encapsulated in polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PSPAA) shells and then used as monomers for their self-assembly. Spherical PSPAA micelles upon acid treatment are known to assemble into cylindrical micelles. Exploiting this tendency, the core-shell nanoparticles are induced to aggregate, coalesce, and then transform into long chains. When more than one type of nanoparticles are used, random and block "copolymers" of nanoparticles can be obtained. Detailed procedures are reported for the PSPAA encapsulation of nanoparticles, homo- and co-polymerization of the core-shell nanoparticles, separation and purification of the resulting nanoparticle chains. Transformations of single-line chains into double- and triple-line chains are also presented. The synergy between the polymer shell and the embedded nanoparticles leads to an unusual chain-growth polymerization mode, giving long nanoparticle chains that are distinct from the products of the traditional step-growth aggregation process.

TITLE: A Method for Studying the Temperature Dependence of Dynamic Fracture and Fragmentation.
AUTHORS: Jones David R, Chapman David J, Eakins Daniel E

PMID: 26168019
DOI: 10.3791/52463

ABSTRACT:
The dynamic fracture of a body is a late-stage phenomenon typically studied under simplified conditions, in which a sample is deformed under uniform stress and strain rate. This can be produced by evenly loading the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to the axial symmetry, as the cylinder expands the wall is placed into a tensile hoop stress that is uniform around the circumference. While there are various techniques to generate this expansion such as explosives, electromagnetic drive, and existing gas gun techniques they are all limited in the fact that the sample cylinder must be at room temperature. We present a new method using a gas gun that facilitates experiments on cylinders from 150 K to 800 K with a consistent, repeatable loading. These highly diagnosed experiments are used to examine the effect of temperature on the fracture mechanisms responsible for failure, and their resulting influence on fragmentation statistics. The experimental geometry employs a steel ogive located inside the target cylinder, with the tip located about halfway in. A single stage light gas gun is then used to launch a polycarbonate projectile into the cylinder at 1,000 m/sec(-1). The projectile impacts and flows around the rigid ogive, driving the sample cylinder from the inside. The use of a non-deforming ogive insert allows us to install temperature control hardware inside the rear of the cylinder. Liquid nitrogen (LN₂) is used for cooling and a resistive high current load for heating. Multiple channels of upshifted photon Doppler velocimetry (PDV) track the expansion velocity along the cylinder enabling direct comparison to computer simulations, while High speed imaging is used to measure the strain to failure. The recovered cylinder fragments are also subject to optical and electron microscopy to ascertain the failure mechanism.

DOI: 10.3791/52818

ABSTRACT:
When a chemical fuel at a certain position in a hybrid composite of the fuel and a micro/nanostructured material is ignited, chemical combustion occurs along the interface between the fuel and core materials. Simultaneously, dynamic changes in thermal and chemical potentials across the micro/nanostructured materials result in concomitant electrical energy generation induced by charge transfer in the form of a high-output voltage pulse. We demonstrate the entire procedure of a thermopower wave experiment, from synthesis to evaluation. Thermal chemical vapor deposition and the wet impregnation process are respectively employed for the synthesis of a multi-walled carbon nanotube array and a hybrid composite of picric acid/sodium azide/multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The prepared hybrid composites are used to fabricate a thermopower wave generator with connecting electrodes. The combustion of the hybrid composite is initiated by laser heating or Joule-heating, and the corresponding combustion propagation, direct electrical energy generation, and real-time temperature changes are measured using a high-speed microscopy system, an oscilloscope, and an optical pyrometer, respectively. Furthermore, the crucial strategies to be adopted in the synthesis of hybrid composite and initiation of their combustion that enhance the overall thermopower wave energy transfer are proposed.

TITLE: Radiographers' Ability to Detect Low-Contrast Detail in Digital Radiography Systems.
AUTHORS: Alsleem Haney, Davidson Robert
JOURNAL: Radiologic technology (2015)
PMID: 26377266

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: To evaluate radiographers' ability to detect low-contrast detail using various digital planar radiographic systems. METHODS: A low-contrast detail phantom was placed between two 5-cm thick Perspex sheets (Lucite International). Images were obtained using different kilovoltage peak and milliamperage second (mAs) settings with computed radiography (CR), indirect conversion digital radiography (IDR), and direct conversion digital radiography (DR) systems. Six groups of 6 radiographers were asked to score 39 images; each group scored 2 images from each system for a total of 6 images. The seventh group scored only one image from each system for a total of 3 images. The radiographers' results were compared with the results of analyzer software. The inverse image quality factor was used to measure low-contrast detail detectability performance. RESULTS: Radiographers performed significantly worse than the computerized software in determining low-contrast detail in planar radiographic images (P < .01). However, a positive correlation (R = 0.558) existed between the 2 sets of scores in terms of low-contrast detail detectability performance. DISCUSSION: On average, radiographers were able to detect increased image quality resulting from increased mAs. Radiographers reached results similar to the software regarding whether IDR and DR have better detectability performances than CR. Differences found among individual radiographers were not as significant with DR. CONCLUSION: When radiographers' performance in detecting low-contrast detail was evaluated and compared with that of the software, radiographers exhibited poorer performances. Because radiographers are responsible for image quality optimization, additional training might improve their ability to detect low-contrast detail in DR systems.

ABSTRACT:
Many molecular mechanisms in complex biological processes of diseases cannot be fully understood without direct visualization. In the last decades, advances in imaging principles and technologies have expanded our ability to capture and analyze the morphology of tissues and cells' components on conventional widefield optical and fluorescence microscopies and their derivatives confocal and multiphoton fluorescence laser-scanning microscopes, as well as transmission electron microscopes. Innovative imaging technologies are now emerging for constructing fine structural features, precise localization and the dynamic interplay of single and macromolecular assemblies that drive cell growth, differentiation and cell death as well as stromal and chromatin remodeling within many cellular context. The newer super-resolution microscopies capture images with unprecedented sensitivity and clarity allowing the exploration of interactions between individual molecules with a distance resolution as low as 20 nm. But these techniques are not robust enough to quantitate molecules on a genome-wide scale. Mass spectrometry imaging is a high-throughput chemical imaging technique for the identification, quantitation and distribution of proteins, lipids and chemical metabolites at picomol level within a single-cell and complex multicellular tissue. Here we provide an overview on imaging instrumentations and computational platforms to store, data mining, analyze and retrieving genomic, proteomic and immunohistochemistry digital image information which are available for multilevel academic-private collaborations. The expansion of these data sets will lead to a merge picture from it we will retrieve knowledge for more rational-design systems to basic and clinical research in near future.

TITLE: Using neutron spin echo resolved grazing incidence scattering to investigate organic solar cell materials.
AUTHORS: Parnell Andrew J, Hobson Adam, Dalgliesh Robert M, Jones Richard A L, Dunbar Alan D F
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2014)
PMID: 24457355
DOI: 10.3791/51129

ABSTRACT:
The spin echo resolved grazing incidence scattering (SERGIS) technique has been used to probe the length-scales associated with irregularly shaped crystallites. Neutrons are passed through two well defined regions of magnetic field; one before and one after the sample. The two magnetic field regions have opposite polarity and are tuned such that neutrons travelling through both regions, without being perturbed, will undergo the same number of precessions in opposing directions. In this case the neutron precession in the second arm is said to "echo" the first, and the original polarization of the beam is preserved. If the neutron interacts with a sample and scatters elastically the path through the second arm is not the same as the first and the original polarization is not recovered. Depolarization of the neutron beam is a highly sensitive probe at very small angles (<50 μrad) but still allows a high intensity, divergent beam to be used. The decrease in polarization of the beam reflected from the sample as compared to that from the reference sample can be directly related to structure within the sample. In comparison to scattering observed in neutron reflection measurements the SERGIS signals are often weak and are unlikely to be observed if the in-plane structures within the sample under investigation are dilute, disordered, small in size and polydisperse or the neutron scattering contrast is low. Therefore, good results will most likely be obtained using the SERGIS technique if the sample being measured consist of thin films on a flat substrate and contain scattering features that contains a high density of moderately sized features (30 nm to 5 µm) which scatter neutrons strongly or the features are arranged on a lattice. An advantage of the SERGIS technique is that it can probe structures in the plane of the sample.

TITLE: Assessing cell cycle progression of neural stem and progenitor cells in the mouse developing brain after genotoxic stress.
AUTHORS: Etienne Olivier, Bery Amandine, Roque Telma, Desmaze Chantal, Boussin François D
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2014)
PMID: 24837791
DOI: 10.3791/51209

ABSTRACT:
Neurons of the cerebral cortex are generated during brain development from different types of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPC), which form a pseudostratified epithelium lining the lateral ventricles of the embryonic brain. Genotoxic stresses, such as ionizing radiation, have highly deleterious effects on the developing brain related to the high sensitivity of NSPC. Elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved depends on the characterization of the DNA damage response of these particular types of cells, which requires an accurate method to determine NSPC progression through the cell cycle in the damaged tissue. Here is shown a method based on successive intraperitoneal injections of EdU and BrdU in pregnant mice and further detection of these two thymidine analogues in coronal sections of the embryonic brain. EdU and BrdU are both incorporated in DNA of replicating cells during S phase and are detected by two different techniques (azide or a specific antibody, respectively), which facilitate their simultaneous detection. EdU and BrdU staining are then determined for each NSPC nucleus in function of its distance from the ventricular margin in a standard region of the dorsal telencephalon. Thus this dual labeling technique allows distinguishing cells that progressed through the cell cycle from those that have activated a cell cycle checkpoint leading to cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. An example of experiment is presented, in which EdU was injected before irradiation and BrdU immediately after and analyzes performed within the 4 hr following irradiation. This protocol provides an accurate analysis of the acute DNA damage response of NSPC in function of the phase of the cell cycle at which they have been irradiated. This method is easily transposable to many other systems in order to determine the impact of a particular treatment on cell cycle progression in living tissues.

DOI: 10.3791/51981

ABSTRACT:
Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful experimental model system for studying the function of the nervous system. Gene mutations that cause dysfunction of the nervous system often produce viable larvae and adults that have locomotion defective phenotypes that are difficult to adequately describe with text or completely represent with a single photographic image. Current modes of scientific publishing, however, support the submission of digital video media as supplemental material to accompany a manuscript. Here we describe a simple and widely accessible microscopy technique for acquiring high-quality digital video of both Drosophila larval and adult phenotypes from a lateral perspective. Video of larval and adult locomotion from a side-view is advantageous because it allows the observation and analysis of subtle distinctions and variations in aberrant locomotive behaviors. We have successfully used the technique to visualize and quantify aberrant crawling behaviors in third instar larvae, in addition to adult mutant phenotypes and behaviors including grooming.

TITLE: A Fluorescent Indicator for Imaging Lysosomal Zinc(II) with Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-Enhanced Photostability and a Narrow Band of Emission.

JOURNAL: Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany) (2014)
PMID: 25378058

ABSTRACT:
We demonstrate a strategy to transfer the zinc(II) sensitivity of a fluoroionophore with low photostability and a broad emission band to a bright and photostable fluorophore with a narrow emission band. The two fluorophores are covalently connected to afford an intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) conjugate. The FRET donor in the conjugate is a zinc(II)-sensitive arylvinylbipyridyl fluoroionophore, the absorption and emission of which undergo bathochromic shifts upon zinc(II) coordination. When the FRET donor is excited, efficient intramolecular energy transfer occurs to result in the emission of the acceptor boron dipyrromethene (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene or BODIPY) as a function of zinc(II) concentration. The broad emission band of the donor/zinc(II) complex is transformed into the strong, narrow emission band of the BODIPY acceptor in the FRET conjugates, which can be captured within the narrow emission window that is preferred for multicolor imaging experiments. In addition to competing with other nonradiative decay processes of the FRET donor, the rapid intramolecular FRET of the excited FRET-conjugate molecule protects the donor fluorophore from photobleaching, thus enhancing the photostability of the indicator. FRET conjugates 3 and 4 contain aliphatic amino groups, which selectively target lysosomes in mammalian cells. This subcellular localization preference was verified by using confocal fluorescence microscopy, which also shows the zinc(II)-enhanced emission of 3 and 4 in lysosomes. It was further shown using two-color structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which is capable of extending the lateral resolution over the Abbe diffraction limit by a factor of two, that the morpholino-functionalized compound 4 localizes in the interior of lysosomes, rather than anchoring on the lysosomal membranes, of live HeLa cells.

ABSTRACT:
Whole genome amplification and sequencing of single microbial cells enables genomic characterization without the need of cultivation (1-3). Viruses, which are ubiquitous and the most numerous entities on our planet (4) and important in all environments (5), have yet to be revealed via similar approaches. Here we describe an approach for isolating and characterizing the genomes of single virions called 'Single Virus Genomics' (SVG). SVG utilizes flow cytometry to isolate individual viruses and whole genome amplification to obtain high molecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) that can be used in subsequent sequencing reactions.

ABSTRACT:
The integration of low-temperature scanning-probe techniques and single-electron capacitance spectroscopy represents a powerful tool to study the electronic quantum structure of small systems - including individual atomic dopants in semiconductors. Here we present a capacitance-based method, known as Subsurface Charge Accumulation (SCA) imaging, which is capable of resolving single-electron charging while achieving sufficient spatial resolution to image individual atomic dopants. The use of a capacitance technique enables observation of subsurface features, such as dopants buried many nanometers beneath the surface of a semiconductor material(1,2,3). In principle, this technique can be applied to any system to resolve electron motion below an insulating surface. As in other electric-field-sensitive scanned-probe techniques(4), the lateral spatial resolution of the measurement depends in part on the radius of curvature of the probe tip. Using tips with a small radius of curvature can enable spatial resolution of a few tens of nanometers. This fine spatial resolution allows investigations of small numbers (down to one) of subsurface dopants(1,2). The charge resolution depends greatly on the sensitivity of the charge detection circuitry; using high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) in such circuits at cryogenic temperatures enables a sensitivity of approximately 0.01 electrons/Hz(½) at 0.3 K(5).

ABSTRACT:
Neural crest cells (NCC) are a transient and multipotent cell population that originates from the dorsal neural tube and migrates extensively throughout the developing vertebrate embryo. In addition to providing peripheral glia and neurons, NCC generate melanocytes as well as most of the cranio-facial skeleton. NCC migration and differentiation is controlled by a combination of their axial origin along the neural tube and their exposure to regionally distinct extracellular cues. Such contribution of extracellular ligands is especially evident during the formation of the enteric nervous system (ENS), a complex interconnected network of neural ganglia that locally controls (among other things) gut muscle movement and intestinal motility. Most of the ENS is derived from a small initial pool of NCC that undertake a long journey in order to colonize - in a rostral to caudal fashion - the entire length of the prospective gut. Among several signaling pathways known to influence enteric NCC colonization, GDNF/RET signaling is recognized as the most important. Indeed, spatiotemporally controlled secretion of the RET ligand GDNF by the gut mesenchyme is chiefly responsible for the attraction and guidance of RET-expressing enteric NCC to and within the embryonic gut. Here, we describe an ex vivo cell migration assay, making use of a transgenic mouse line possessing fluorescently labeled NCC, which allows precise quantification of enteric NCC migration potential in the presence of various growth factors, including GDNF.

TITLE: Growth assays to assess polyglutamine toxicity in yeast.
AUTHORS: Duennwald Martin L
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2012)
PMID: 22415521
DOI: 10.3791/3461

ABSTRACT:
Protein misfolding is associated with many human diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by the abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) region within the protein huntingtin. The polyQ-expanded huntingtin protein attains an aberrant conformation (i.e. it misfolds) and causes cellular toxicity. At least eight further neurodegenerative diseases are caused by polyQ-expansions, including the Spinocerebellar Ataxias and Kennedy's disease. The model organism yeast has facilitated significant insights into the cellular and molecular basis of polyQ-toxicity, including the impact of intra- and inter-molecular factors of polyQ-toxicity, and the identification of cellular pathways that are impaired in cells expressing polyQ-expansion proteins. Importantly, many aspects of polyQ-toxicity that were found in yeast were reproduced in other experimental systems and to some extent in samples from HD patients, thus demonstrating the significance of the yeast model for the discovery of basic mechanisms underpinning polyQ-toxicity. A direct and relatively simple way to determine polyQ-toxicity in yeast is to measure growth defects of yeast cells expressing polyQ-expansion proteins. This manuscript describes three complementary experimental approaches to determine polyQ-toxicity in yeast by measuring the growth of yeast cells expressing polyQ-expansion proteins. The first two experimental approaches monitor yeast growth on plates, the third approach monitors the growth of liquid yeast cultures using the BioscreenC instrument. Furthermore, this manuscript describes experimental difficulties that can occur when handling yeast polyQ models and outlines strategies that will help to avoid or minimize these difficulties. The protocols described here can be used to identify and to characterize genetic pathways and small molecules that modulate polyQ-toxicity. Moreover, the described assays may serve as templates for accurate analyses of the toxicity caused by other disease-associated misfolded proteins in yeast models.

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: Categorization and evaluation of online teaching files in radiology by representative members of the target group to make the specific search for adequate programs more effective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative team of board qualified radiologists, residents and medical students performed a basic search for radiology teaching files on the Internet using search machines, international mailing lists and link lists to collections of national and international radiological societies and departments. The programs were categorized by language, modality, target group and special features, such as qualification for CME-accreditation. For final evaluation and ranking of the detected files, a questionnaire was developed to assess completeness, image quality, page loading time, layout, orientation, interactivity, annotation and maintenance. The results were stored in an Access database on a web server. A query form in HTML format, including the parameters described above, was made accessible to the online user. RESULTS: A search machine for radiological teaching files (RadList/Entity-link List) was made available online ( www.tnt-radiology.de/radlist and www.tnt-radiology.de/entitylinklist ). A submitted request calls a cgi script that searches the database for the appropriate sites according to the individual search parameters selected by the user. The list of matching URLs is returned to the user as HTML page. Evaluating the single sites by applying the criteria listed above contributed to the quality assurance of the radiological teaching resources on the Internet. CONCLUSION: Adapting a new Internet interface to the particular needs of the user allows a more effective access to specific radiological teaching files online. RadList/Entity-link List ( www.tnt-radiology.de/radlist and www.tnt-radiology.de/entitylinklist ) is conducive to quality improvement and benefits users as well as authors of radiological teaching files on the Internet.

TITLE: Analysis of environmental particles by atomic force microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
AUTHORS: Mavrocordatos D, Pronk W, Boiler M
JOURNAL: Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research (2004)
PMID: 15685998

ABSTRACT:
Due to their large specific surface and their abundance, micro and nano particles play an important role in the transport of micropollutants in the environment. Natural particles are usually composed of a mixture of inorganic amorphous or crystalline material (mainly FeOOH, Fe(x)Oy, Mn(x)Oy and clays) and organic material (humics and polysaccharides). They all tend to occur as very small particles (1-1,000 nm in diameter). Most natural amorphous particles are unstable and tend to transform with time towards more crystalline forms, either by aging or possibly, by dissolution and re-crystallization. Such transformations affect the fate of sorbed micropollutants and the scavenging properties are therefore changed. As these entities are sensitive to dehydration (aggregation, changes in the morphology), it is highly important to observe their morphology in their natural environment and understand their composition at the scale of the individual particles. Also for the understanding and optimization of water treatment technologies, the knowledge of the occurrence and behavior of nano-particles is of high importance. Some of the possible particle analysis methods are presented: aggregation processes, biomineralization, bacterial adhesion, biofilms in freshwaters, ferrihydrite as heavy metals remover from storm water. These examples demonstrate the capabilities and focus of the microscopes. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows to analyze the particles in their own environment, meaning in air or in the water. Thus, native aspects of particles can be observed. As well, forces of interactions between particles or between particles and other surfaces such as membranes will be highly valuable data. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and for higher lateral resolution, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) allow measurement of the morphology and composition. Especially, TEM coupled with Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (TEM-EELS) is a powerful technique for elemental analysis. Finally, general guidelines for the effective use of microscopic techniques are provided.

ABSTRACT:
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by Hantaan virus, poses a serious public health threat. Current diagnostic methods remain limited by low sensitivity, complex procedures, and high sample requirements. To address this, we developed a highly sensitive single-molecule biosensor using multi-fluorophore nucleic acid probes and STORM imaging for the detection of Hantaan virus RNA. The probe was synthesized via PCR incorporating EdUTP, enabling site-specific coupling of multiple Cy5 fluorophores through copper-catalyzed click chemistry. This multi-fluorophore probe, combined with magnetic beads and a capture sequence, specifically targeted viral RNA and enabled quantification by super-resolution imaging. Compared to conventional single-fluorophore probes, our system exhibited a significantly lower detection limit of 57.54 aM. Notably, this is the first application of STORM to a single-molecule viral RNA detection platform. The method offers a broadly applicable, ultrasensitive strategy for early clinical diagnostics of Hantaan virus and potentially other pathogens.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: Intra-plaque neovascularization (IPN) is associated with carotid plaque progression and instability, increasing the risk of ischemic stroke due to hemorrhage and rupture. This study investigated the feasibility of ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) to extract microvascular features from carotid plaque using standard low-frame-rate clinical contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), aiming to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques. METHODS: Between August 2020 and October 2022, 65 consecutive patients with 78 carotid atherosclerotic plaques, evaluated by clinical CEUS, were prospectively included. These plaques were assessed for ischemic symptoms. ULM involved localizing individual microbubbles at a subwavelength scale, which were then tracked to assess anatomical (microvessel density, length and tortuosity) and functional (blood velocity) features for characterization of the carotid plaque and classification of symptomatic versus asymptomatic plaques. RESULTS: The study found that ULM could successfully visualize IPN in carotid plaques at a significantly higher resolution than conventional CEUS images. IPN density in symptomatic plaques (30 of 78) was significantly higher than in asymptomatic ones, with median microbubble counts of 37.93 (26.16-61.78) versus 23.55 (12.53-37.58), track counts of 2.65 (1.41-5.18) versus 1.30 (0.74-2.43) and microbubble paths of 4.08 (2.03-6.09) mm versus 1.86 (1.17-3.16) mm (all p < 0.05). Additionally, symptomatic plaques showed higher velocities, with a median of 3.64 (2.61-5.24) mm/s, compared to 3.55 (2.52-4.97) mm/s in asymptomatic plaques (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: These quantitative imaging biomarkers by ULM with clinical CEUS show promise for the development of a diagnostic tool aiding in patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making.

TITLE: Manipulation and Analysis of Cell Cycle-Dependent Processes in Budding Yeast.

ABSTRACT:
Eukaryotic cells follow a conserved cell cycle that regulates diverse processes, including DNA maintenance and organelle homeostasis. Studying cellular processes in a cell cycle-dependent manner is often necessary to properly interpret experimental results. There are chemical and genetic methods available to produce cell cycle synchronization in cultured cells across a wide swath of organisms, including vertebrate models, enabling the study of cell cycle-dependent processes. However, among model organisms, budding yeast remains a powerhouse for cell cycle analysis due to its particularly robust synchronization methods, short generation time, and genetic tractability. Yeast shares core cell cycle machinery with other eukaryotes, which has enabled landmark discoveries in cell cycle regulation. This protocol details methods for cell cycle analysis in yeast, focusing on G1 arrest-release and mitotic arrest-release experiments, including strain construction, culture preparation, and microscopy. PCR tagging methods for producing suitable strains for cell cycle arrests and fluorescence microscopy are presented. A G1 arrest is achieved using the peptide pheromone α-factor, and brief washes result in synchronous release and cell cycle progression. Samples are taken at different time points following release into the cell cycle and fixed for microscopy. A second method arrests yeast cells in mitosis by depleting the cell cycle regulator Cdc20 to achieve a metaphase-arrested population, as well as optional release into anaphase. Samples are fixed and prepared for imaging pre- and post-release, and are imaged and analyzed. Image analysis focuses on cataloging dynamic localization and population abundance changes of proteins in the cell cycle. These synchronization methods are suitable for diverse cell cycle manipulations, and while their use in imaging fixed cells is highlighted here, they can be adapted for many other analyses, including live cell imaging as well as biochemical and molecular assays.

ABSTRACT:
Raman fingerprint spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging are emerging tools for studying metabolic profiles of biological specimens. While Raman fingerprint spectroscopy detects intrinsic molecular vibrations that reflect the molecular composition and chemical environment of a sample, fluorescence lifetime imaging measures changes in the excited-state lifetime of fluorophores that are sensitive to their microenvironments. Here, we present a multimodal imaging platform combining broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2p-FLIM) microscopy that can acquire biologically relevant Raman fingerprint spectra and fluorescence lifetime signals in vivo and simultaneously. The tremendous chemical information obtained from spatially co-registered BCARS and 2p-FLIM images allows us to characterize the subtle differences between sub-cellular compartments and verify the potential false-positive results generated by fluorescence imaging alone. This is demonstrated by directly comparing the BCARS, 2p-FLIM, and two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) signals simultaneously obtained from the same dye-stained organelle in the live, intact C. elegans expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker. In this work, we introduce the BCARS/2p-FLIM/TPEF setup scheme, the image acquisition steps, data processing, and representative results showing that the cross-modality imaging method enables rigorous characterization and in vivo detection at sub-cellular resolution. This protocol provides a framework for simultaneous chemical and fluorescence lifetime imaging to improve the accuracy of biological interpretation in complex living systems.

TITLE: Live Imaging Characterization of Centromere Movements During Male Meiotic Prophase in Arabidopsis thaliana.
AUTHORS: Lefranc Sandrine, Andrey Philippe, Grelon Mathilde, Cromer Laurence
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 41212841
DOI: 10.3791/68569

ABSTRACT:
Meiosis is a cellular division, essential for sexual reproduction. During meiotic prophase, homologous chromosomes of maternal and paternal origin recognize each other and associate, a process that is facilitated by their rapid movements in the nucleoplasm. Meiotic prophase movements rely on the attachment of the chromosomes to the nuclear envelope and on cytoplasmic forces transmitted to the chromosomes through the nuclear envelope. In plants, the limited accessibility and fragility of male meiocytes inside the anthers make live imaging approaches and chromosome movement analysis technically challenging. Indeed, these movements are very rapid, and analyzing them requires finding the optimal acquisition conditions. Here, an efficient method to capture rapid chromosome movements during male meiotic prophase in Arabidopsis thaliana is described, in time-lapse movies, by following the movements of fluorescent-tagged centromeres. It is based on anther dissection and image acquisition using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), in 3D and over time. Acquiring meiotic z-stacks every 7 s allows sufficient resolution to reconstruct and analyze the trajectories of tagged centromeres. The extracted data is subsequently processed, enabling the quantitative analysis of these chromosomal movements. The development of models from this data is essential for understanding the mechanism of rapid chromosome movement, including the nature and intensity of the forces driving this process.

TITLE: High-throughput Imaging and Analysis Workflow for Evaluating Skin Cell Phenotypes and Proliferation States in Tissue Samples.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 41248009
DOI: 10.3791/67696

ABSTRACT:
Skin injuries initiate a complex regenerative cascade that engages various cell types. Amongst those, peripheral glial cells play a critical role in ensuring the success of the repair process. However, our understanding of these processes remains incomplete due to limitations in current technologies. Therefore, the iterative-bleaching-extends-multiplexity (IBEX) method was employed to characterize changes to the cellular composition of the skin using antibodies directed against proteins expressed by key cell types and structures involved in tissue regeneration. Importantly, antibodies directed against cell proliferation markers often underestimate the number of dividing cells in the skin. To overcome this limitation, Click-iT EdU chemistry was combined with the IBEX method, allowing detailed characterization of proliferating cell types. Using a fully automated spinning disk confocal microscope, a high-throughput workflow was developed for iterative imaging of samples sectioned into 24-well plates. Beyond extending the IBEX method to evaluate cell states in situ with Click-iT EdU, a novel open-source image processing pipeline was also introduced to perform image correction, stitching, and registration, and can be used by researchers without extensive programming experience. Moreover, a detailed documentation on processing and visualizing highly multiplexed imaging data (using conventional image analysis software, including Fiji and QuPath) is also provided. In summary, this protocol highlights the versatility of the IBEX protocol and demonstrates its adaptation to an established conventional imaging platform. Notably, combining IBEX with Click-iT EdU labeling enables the detection and categorization of actively dividing cell types in intact tissues and during highly dynamic processes at spatial resolution.

TITLE: Rapid Whole-Mount High-Resolution Imaging of Small Animal Vasculature for Quantitative Studies.
AUTHORS: Zhang Daibo, Lindsey Stephanie E
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 40489398
DOI: 10.3791/68206

ABSTRACT:
In small animal models of cardiovascular development and diseases, subject-specific computational simulations of blood flow enable quantitative assessments of hemodynamic metrics that are difficult to measure experimentally. Computational fluid dynamic simulations shed light on the critical roles of mechanics in cardiovascular function and disease progression. Acquiring high-quality volumetric images of the vessels of interest is central to the accuracy and reproducibility of morphological measurement and flow quantitation results. This study proposes a rapid, cost-effective, and accessible method for whole-mount high-resolution imaging of small animal vasculature using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. The modified iDISCO+ (immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs) light-sheet sample preparation protocol involves (1) labeling vasculature with a fluorescent agent, (2) preserving the sample, and (3) rendering the sample transparent. Unlike classical iDISCO+, which uses immunohistochemical staining, the authors label vascular endothelium with FITC-tagged poly-L-lysine, an affordable non-specific fluorescent dye that is highly resistant to photo-bleaching, in a process termed "endo-painting." The rapid labeling reduces sample preparation time from approximately four weeks to less than 3 days. Furthermore, the use of minimally hazardous solvent ethyl cinnamate (ECi) as the clearing agent and imaging solution makes the samples safer to handle and compliant with a wider range of imaging facilities. The proposed protocol is applied to obtain highly resolved light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image stacks of the cardiovascular system in chick embryos ranging from day 3 (HH18) to day 8 (HH34). This study further demonstrates the suitability of this method for vascular quantitation through 3D reconstruction and computational hemodynamic modeling of a day 5 (HH 26) chick embryo.

PMID: 40489403
DOI: 10.3791/68075

ABSTRACT:
Metabolically regulated Akt activation is a critical node in the insulin signaling cascade and provides valuable insights into the relationship between diabetes and cancer. To precisely quantify Akt activity in HepG2 cells, we developed a robust, reproducible protocol utilizing Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) with genetically encoded Akt-specific biosensors. This protocol outlines detailed steps for cell culture, imaging dish preparation, and transfection of HepG2 cells to express FRET-based biosensors, alongside specific guidelines for laser scanning confocal microscope hardware and software configuration. The results demonstrated unique patterns of insulin signaling in HepG2 cells, which exhibit an irreversible switch characterized by constitutive Akt activation with a defined switch-on threshold but no switch-off threshold. In contrast, myotubes display a reversible switch. The persistent Akt activation in HepG2 cells suggests mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation in hepatic cells, with broader implications for understanding the progression of metabolic disorders and cancer. This protocol offers a valuable framework for exploring Akt-related signaling pathways and cellular behaviors across various disease contexts.

TITLE: Ex Vivo Single-molecule Analysis of Ryanodine Receptor 2 Assembly in Cardiac and Neuronal Tissue.
AUTHORS: Yin Qianye, Richards Christopher I
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 40758667
DOI: 10.3791/68408

ABSTRACT:
Understanding receptor assembly is critical for elucidating the mechanisms underlying their function and regulation in physiological processes. While traditional in vitro single-molecule studies rely on isolating proteins from heterologous expression systems, they often fail to capture the in vivo physiological complexity involved in the organization and assembly of cell surface proteins. This protocol employs Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) to study GFP-tagged Ryanodine Receptor 2 (RyR2) molecules encapsulated within nanoscale vesicles. These vesicles, generated from organs rapidly extracted from the animal, effectively provide a snapshot of the receptor's assembly state at the time of extraction, enabling detailed analysis of subunit stoichiometry and receptor organization in response to changes in the animal's physiological environment. This approach utilizes TIRFM and stepwise photobleaching analysis to provide a readout of receptor stoichiometry. Imaging receptors at the single-molecule level facilitates the detection of heterogeneity within the receptor populations assembled in a live animal and enables monitoring of assembly changes associated with disease states. As a result, this method offers a powerful tool for determining the distribution of receptor assemblies and their correlation to changes in their physiological environment.

ABSTRACT:
Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful technique for visualizing the ultrastructure of cells in three dimensions (3D) at nanometer resolution. However, the manual segmentation of cellular components in cryo-ET data remains a significant bottleneck due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. In this work, we present a novel segmentation workflow that integrates advanced virtual reality (VR) software to enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of segmenting cryo-ET datasets. This workflow leverages an immersive VR tool with intuitive 3D interaction, enabling users to navigate and annotate complex cellular structures in a more natural and interactive environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of the workflow, we applied it to the segmentation of mitochondria in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE1) cells. Mitochondria, essential for cellular energy production and signaling, exhibit dynamic morphological changes, making them an ideal test sample. The VR software facilitated precise delineation of mitochondrial membranes and internal structures, enabling downstream analysis of the segmented membrane structures. We demonstrate that this VR-based segmentation workflow significantly improves the user experience while maintaining accurate segmentation of intricate cellular structures in cryo-ET data. This approach holds promise for broad applications in structural cell biology and science education, offering a transformative tool for researchers engaged in detailed cellular analysis.

ABSTRACT:
Metabolic labeling techniques allow the incorporation of bioorthogonal reporters into glycans, enabling the targeted bioconjugation of molecular dyes within cells through click and bioorthogonal chemistry. Metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) has attracted considerable interest due to the essential role of glycosylation in numerous biological processes that involve molecular recognition and its impact on pathologies ranging from cancer to genetic disorders to viral and bacterial infections. Although MOE is better known for the detection of cell surface glycoconjugates, it is also a very important methodology for the study of intracellular glycans in physiological and pathological contexts. Such studies greatly benefit from high spatial resolution. However, super-resolution microscopy is not readily available in most laboratories and poses challenges for daily implementation. Expansion microscopy is a recent alternative that enhances the resolution of microscopy by physically enlarging biological specimens labeled with fluorescent markers. By embedding the sample in a swellable gel and causing it to expand isotropically through chemical treatment, subcellular structures can be visualized with enhanced precision and resolution without the need for super-resolution techniques. In this work, we illustrate the capacity of expansion microscopy to visualize intracellular sialylated glycans through the combined use of MOE and click chemistry. Specifically, we propose a procedure for bioorthogonal labeling and expansion microscopy that employs a reporter targeting sialylation, which may be associated with immunofluorescence for co-localization studies. This protocol enables localization studies of sialoconjugate biosynthesis, intracellular trafficking, and recycling.

ABSTRACT:
Nanoencapsulation of mammalian cells is a novel approach offering a protective microenvironment for cells, enabling their sustained viability and function in hostile or non-physiological conditions. This protection is particularly valuable in applications, such as cell therapy, tissue engineering, and immunotherapy, where maintaining cell functionality is critical for therapeutic success. The encapsulation process involves surrounding cells with a biomaterial barrier that acts as an artificial cell wall, shielding them from immune system attacks, toxic substances, and mechanical stress, while still allowing the exchange of essential nutrients, gases, and waste; thus, preserving cell viability and function during biochemical processing and applications. Utilizing THP-1 immune cells and human intestinal organoids (HIOs) as examples, this article provides a comprehensive guide for encapsulating single cells and stem cell-derived large cell aggregates with silk ionomers derived from the silkworm Bombyx mori, applying an electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition technique. We provide a detailed protocol for preparing silk fibroin (SF) from silk cocoons, synthesizing silk ionomers using the prepared SF, and encapsulating immune cells and organoids through electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition. This article also outlines the characterization methods, such as confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) for coating thickness, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for stiffness measurement. Guidelines for assessing cellular function post-encapsulation are also provided, enabling researchers to build on these methods and advance silk-based encapsulation in biomedical applications. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
The lymphatic vasculature (LV) plays a crucial role in regulating the trafficking of immune cells into lymph nodes during homeostasis and under inflammatory conditions. LV dysfunction has been linked to various inflammatory and neuroinflammatory diseases. Thus, assessing the LV coverage area using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy is essential for accurately determining the extent of inflammation in the tissue. However, manual selection processes may require considerable time to finalize and are inherently more prone to errors, which can compromise the consistency of results among various users and lead to imprecise measurements. Here, we have developed an improved protocol to determine the area of LV covering the intestinal and meningeal tissues. By using this protocol, regions of interest can be identified more accurately and efficiently than through manual measurement, allowing for efficient analysis of changes in LV coverage during inflammation. Colon tissue and meninges obtained from mice under different experimental conditions were stained with LV-specific antibodies. Confocal microscopy was used to capture all images. Here, the manual selection protocol was compared with our semi-automatic selection protocol using the Fiji software Threshold tool. Using this tool, we successfully automated the selection of regions of interest, achieving greater accuracy in our values and minimizing both errors and the time spent by the operator. Additionally, this tool produces much more specific selections than those performed manually, and the results are more accurate. Finally, it is essential to note that this protocol can be adapted for use with other microscopy techniques, provided the image has sufficient contrast against the background and the scale size is known. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Cardiac microtissues (cMTs) are three-dimensional, self-organizing structures that recapitulate key features of native heart tissue. cMTs can be generated using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology by combining iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells (ECs), and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in a predefined ratio that closely resembles the cellular composition of the heart. Although cMTs lack true vascular perfusion, the incorporation of endothelial cells promotes the spontaneous formation of microvascular-like networks, which are identifiable within the 3D structure. The presence of vascular endothelial cells within cMTs enhances cardiomyocyte maturation and contraction force, while also making these models valuable in disease modeling, particularly for conditions involving endothelial dysfunction. High-resolution imaging of cMTs allows detailed visualization of cellular components and analysis of vascular-like structures, providing critical insights into the complex interactions between cardiac cells and their microenvironment. Here, we present protocols for the generation and examination of scaffold-free, vascularized cMTs derived from human iPSCs. First, we outline the steps for aggregation of pre-differentiated iPSC-CMs, iPSC-ECs, and iPSC-CFs to form vascularized cMTs. We then detail the downstream methodology for fluorescence labeling of both whole-mount and sectioned cMTs, followed by image acquisition, visualization, and capture using confocal microscopy. Finally, we demonstrate image analysis, and the measurement of the capillary-like networks using ImageJ (FIJI) software, with 3D modeling and Z-stack processing modules. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
In contrast to microplastics, studying the interactions of nanoplastics (NPs) with primary producers such as marine microalgae remains challenging. This is attributed to the lack of adequate visualization methods that can distinguish NPs from autofluorescent biological material such as marine algae. The aim of this study was to develop a method for labeling and visualizing nonfluorescent micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) of various polymer types, shapes, and sizes, in interaction with marine primary producers, which are autofluorescent. A labeling technique for plastics was refined, using a swell incorporation method with the commercial dye "IDye." Comprehensive quality control measures, including toxicity, leaching, and dye longevity tests, were applied to ensure the robustness of the method. Although stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy successfully enabled the visualization of the diverse labeled NPs smaller than 200 nm, it could not distinguish NPs from autofluorescent organic material such as marine microalgae, due to overlapping excitation and emission spectra with the photosynthetically active molecule chlorophyll-a. This study is the first to advance the field by coupling STED with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The FLIM technique, based on the differing lifetimes of fluorescent signals, allowed us to overcome the challenge of overlapping spectra. Our work not only refines and expands existing plastic labeling protocols to accommodate a wide range of polymer types, but also introduces a more precise method for studying interactions between MNPs and autofluorescent organisms. This combined STED-FLIM approach provides a reproducible and reliable framework for examining MNP impacts in complex, ecologically relevant environments, particularly highlighting its potential for investigating MNP-microalgae interactions.

ABSTRACT:
One of the most significant advances in stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy is its capacity for dynamic super-resolution imaging of living cells, including the long-term tracking of interactions between various cells or organelles. Consequently, the multicolor STED plays a pivotal role in biological research. Despite the emergence of numerous fluorescent probes characterized by low toxicity, high stability, high brightness, and exceptional specificity, enabling dynamic imaging of living cells with multicolor STED, practical implementation of multicolor STED for live-cell imaging is influenced by several factors. These factors include the power and wavelength of the STED beam, the duration of imaging, the size of the imaging area, and the complexity of sample preparation. Presently, a major limitation of multicolor STED is the requirement for high STED power, which hinders the monitoring of interactions between different cells or organelles due to the associated irreversible optical damage. To address this issue, this paper emphasizes research findings based on the digitally enhanced STED (DE-STED) technique. This method overcomes the aforementioned challenge by utilizing low STED laser power to achieve prolonged two-color STED super-resolution imaging of living cells, effectively mitigating phototoxic effects and enhancing the capacity to observe intracellular dynamics. With a depletion laser power of less than 1 mW, we achieved a resolution of about 87 nm, close to that achievable with conventional high-power STED technology.

ABSTRACT:
Interactions between lipid droplets (LDs) and mitochondria are vital for maintaining the cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis. However, visualizing these interaction dynamics at a high resolution in live cells is still very challenging. Here, a boron-bridged near-infrared probe (QI-BF) was developed specifically for low-power stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution imaging of LDs. QI-BF exhibited excellent photostability and enabled continuous scanning of 1000+ frames using a STED laser (0.96 MW cm-2, 775 nm), without significant fluorescence decay. Furthermore, dynamic dual-color STED super-resolution visualization of the morphological interactions between LDs and mitochondria was achieved with the aid of commercial mitochondrial dyes. For the first time, the dynamic process of mitochondrial wrapping around the LDs and LD-mediated mitochondria tubulation were successfully captured. This study sheds light on developing ultraphotostable organic fluorescent probes for versatile low-power STED nanoscopy.

ABSTRACT:
The ability to map protein-protein interactions (PPI) within living cells at high spatial resolution is essential for unraveling their roles in cellular biology. Although several super-resolution microscopy techniques are available, visualizing PPI below the diffraction limit of light across entire live cells remains a challenge. An approach is introduced that combines the chemogenetic split fluorescent reporter splitFAST2 with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy for sub-diffraction imaging of PPI. As the fluorescence of splitFAST2 is activated only where the two proteins interact, this system allows for highly precise and unambiguous localization in live cells, enhanced further by the rapid super-resolution imaging capabilities of STED. The improved spatial resolution of the approach enabled us to precisely map the subcellular localization of inducible interactions or constitutive interactions. Beyond simply detecting PPIs below the diffraction limit in whole living cells, splitFAST2 also serves as the basis for fluorescent probes with very low background, enabling effective subdiffraction imaging of repetitive cellular structures like filamentous actin and microtubules.

ABSTRACT:
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is caused by pathogenic ABCD1 variants, leading to a dysfunctional peroxisomal ABCD1 transporter, crucial for β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). The clinical manifestation ranges from asymptomatic carriers to severe childhood cerebral ALD (CALD). The underlying pathophysiology remains unclear, and while elevated oxidative stress and signs of mitochondrial dysfunction have been observed in X-ALD cells and tissues, their precise roles are still uncertain. This study aims to elucidate the interplay among excess VLCFA, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in fibroblasts derived from CALD and non-CALD patients. Therefore, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate assay, mitochondrial function with the Seahorse XFe24 flux analyzer and assessed the regulation of stress homeostasis on the genetic level by qPCR of NRF2-dependent genes NQO1, AR1B10 and AKR1C1. Additional stress was induced by exposure to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) and hexacosanoic acid (C26:0). Scanning confocal microscopy and STED super-resolution microscopy was implemented for evaluation of mitochondrial structure and peroxisomal-mitochondrial crosstalk. Our findings indicate that non-CALD cell lines exhibit an overall compromised oxidative status under basal conditions, characterized by significantly reduced oxygen consumption rates (OCR) relative to both CALD and healthy controls, along with diminished expression of NRF2-regulated genes. Notably, ROS levels in non-CALD cells are comparable to those observed in CALD cells. However, when exposed to additional stress, these non-CALD cells show greater potential of defense mechanisms and compensation compared to CALD cells. These findings significantly improve our understanding of metabolic changes in X-ALD, focusing on the ability of different X-ALD phenotypes to cope with oxidative stress. They pave the way for further investigations to understand the different phenotypes and their disease progression, to find reliant biomarkers, and to develop therapeutic approaches and preventive measures for individual patients.

ABSTRACT:
We implement a programmable illumination system in stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) using holographic modulation of the excitation beam profile in the sample plane of a widefield fluorescence microscope. A binary hologram is implemented in a plane conjugate to the sample plane using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM). This approach allows a user-defined yet complex illumination pattern to match approximately any arbitrary region of interest (ROI) within the field of view (FOV) of the microscope, while keeping regions outside the ROI unilluminated. The proposed programmable illumination scheme minimizes unnecessary photobleaching of areas not overlapped with the arbitrary illumination pattern, which can be changed in real time programmably without the need for any mechanical movement. The scheme thus facilitates super-resolved STORM imaging, at different instants, of different ROIs of arbitrary shapes in the same FOV of the widefield microscope. We present here a successful experimental implementation of the scheme to image quantum dots and closely spaced actin filaments in human brain cancer (U87MG) cells.

ABSTRACT:
Multicolor single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enables analysis of nanoscale spatial relationships of multiple targets but suffers from technical complexity. CC-STORM simplifies optics by integrating a colorimetry camera with MLE-Locator and NCI-Classifier, yet its low signal-to-noise ratio and undersampled point spread function necessitate >70% data rejection to maintain <2% crosstalk, severely limiting efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we developed CC-DeepSTORM, a deep learning framework combining CC-DeepLoc for localization and CC-DeepSeparator for color-separation. In simulations, CC-DeepLoc enhanced the Jaccard index and localization precision by 1.8× and 2× over MLE-Locator. For single-color experimental data, CC-DeepSeparator reduced data rejection from ∼70% to ∼40% while achieving 1% crosstalk (matching state-of-the-art). In two-color experiments, CC-DeepSTORM significantly outperformed CC-STORM in localization and color-separation, enabling efficient, high-resolution multicolor SMLM for broader biological applications.

ABSTRACT:
Rod photoreceptor stability is critical for retinal health and lifelong vision. Rhodopsin (Rho) trafficking is essential for rod homeostasis, as its mislocalization precedes rod cell death in inherited retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms of Rho trafficking in mammalian rods remain largely undefined. We investigated Rho's subcellular organization in the mammalian rod Golgi complex. We utilized STORM and structured illumination microscopy super-resolution imaging to map Golgi proteins with Rho in mouse and macaque rods. Our analysis found that a large proportion of Rho in this subcellular region colocalizes with Rab6a in the trans-Golgi. To functionally test this interaction, we utilized a dominant-negative Rab6a mutant in HEK293T cells and mouse rods. The mutant significantly inhibits Rho secretion in cell culture, causing intracellular retention. In mouse rods, the mutant similarly causes significant trans-Golgi Rho retention; however, a majority of Rho protein still escaped the Golgi and reached the outer segment. Together, these findings uncover critical new subcellular details about Rho organization at the Golgi and establish a role for Rab6a as a regulator of Rho protein release from the trans-Golgi in mammalian rods. Our results provide critical insight into the protein trafficking mechanisms essential for long-term photoreceptor health.

ABSTRACT:
Heavy metals (HMs) are metalloids that exhibit biological toxicity to plants. Effective management of HM-contaminated environments is crucial for sustainable plant development. Palm seeds, as agricultural residues with nutritional value, show potential for bioremediation applications. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of air-dried (D) and roasted (R) palm seed powder (PSP) as HMs adsorbents. PSP was used to mitigate lead (Pb) toxicity in wheat and reduce its bioavailability in contaminated soils. PSP contains 33% fibers and 23% carbohydrates, and other constituents. PSP could adsorb cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) at 5, 50, and 500 mg L-1 of each HMs. Pb adsorption rates reached a maximum of 93% at 500 mg L-1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis confirmed the porous nature and the presence of active functional groups such as O-H, C-H, and C═O. D and R powders in soil improved the growth parameters under Pb stress by enhancing the production of antioxidant compounds, soluble carbohydrates, protein, and proline. The frequency of damaged nuclei was reduced by PSP treatments in wheat, which in turn reduced Pb-induced DNA damage. When compared to untreated plants, the DNA damage was reduced by 26.63% and 64.95% when D and R PSP were used at 500 mg L-1 Pb, respectively. At 50 mg L-1 Pb, shoots accumulated more Pb than roots (TF = 1.97), while at 500 mg L-1, roots accumulated more (TF = 0.57), reducing the tolerance index (TI) to 50.97. Palm seed powder treatments lowered Pb uptake and increased the TI to 90.61 in 50 mg L-1 Pb D PSP-amended soil. In conclusion, PSPs possess the potential to be an efficient bio-adsorbent of different HMs that could be implemented to sustain plant growth in HMs-contaminated environments. The introduction of palm seed powder (PSP) in two forms, dry and roasted, to the soil was a sustainable and innovative bioremediation for heavy metal contamination. Our research demonstrates that PSP is capable of adsorbing 93% of lead from liquid. The analyses focused on the potential mechanism that underpins the phytoremediation applications of PSP, in addition to its nutritional value. The research reveals novel insights into the mechanisms of DNA damage recovery in wheat, which was cultivated in Pb-contaminated soil that has been amended with PSP. The treated plants exhibit a reduction in nuclear damage of up to 65%. This innovative method establishes palm seeds as eco-friendly adsorbents that simultaneously promote plant growth and detoxify soils in contaminated environments.

TITLE: Molecular Dynamics and Neural Network Analysis Reveal Sequential Gating and Allosteric Communication in FMRFamide-Activated Sodium Channels.

ABSTRACT:
FMRFamide-activated sodium channels (FaNaCs) represent a unique class of neuropeptide-gated ion channels within the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) superfamily. While cryo-electron microscopy has revealed static binding architectures, the dynamic mechanisms underlying ligand recognition, allosteric signal transmission, and channel gating remain poorly understood. Here, we employed microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations coupled with neural relational inference analysis to elucidate the complete activation mechanism of FaNaC at atomic resolution. Our analysis revealed a sophisticated multistage activation process initiated by coordinated dynamics of FaNaC-specific insertions SI1 and SI2. Spontaneous FMRFamide-binding events suggested that SI1 functions as a dynamic gate that facilitates optimal ligand burial and stabilization, while SI2 appeared to serve as a conformational lid stabilizing the bound ligand through thermodynamically favorable induced-fit mechanisms. This ligand-induced conformational change, which involves the cooperative reorganization of the three peripheral loops (L1, L2, and L3) in the extracellular domain, propagates through the extracellular domain, particularly via a coordinated rigid-body motion of the β-ball/palm domain, leading to the reorganization of the central β-sheet in the extracellular vestibule and a subsequent conformational wave that compacts the intracellular vestibule. We further leveraged neural relational inference (NRI) to analyze residue-level allosteric networks, demonstrating that ligand binding enhances the network's connectivity and reorganizes allosteric communication pathways. These findings provide a high-resolution, dynamic view of FaNaC function, revealing a novel gating mechanism for the DEG/ENaC superfamily and laying the foundation for future studies into neuropeptide modulation.

ABSTRACT:
Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is upregulated in various types of malignant tumors, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the precise mechanisms for membrane localization and regulation are not fully understood. Observations from super-resolution microscopy have revealed that NRP1 tends to form nanoscale clusters on the cell membrane, with these clusters varying significantly in size and density across different regions. Further research has shown that stimulation by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can reorganize the distribution of NRP1, reducing the number of small clusters while promoting the formation of larger ones. This suggests a propensity for internalization after activation. Additionally, dual-color dSTORM imaging has demonstrated a certain degree of colocalization between NRP1 and c-MET, indicating that c-MET plays an important role in stabilizing NRP1 clusters. This study provides new insights into the mechanism behind NRP1's clustered distribution on cell membranes and paves the way for developing more effective therapeutic strategies targeting NRP1 within tumors.

ABSTRACT:
The translocator protein (TSPO) is a mitochondrial membrane protein that plays a critical role in cholesterol transport and steroid biosynthesis. While its functional significance is well established, the molecular mechanisms governing TSPO dimerization, particularly the regulatory role of cholesterol, remain incompletely understood. In this study, we first employed direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to experimentally investigate the organization and aggregation of TSPO in living cells under different cholesterol conditions. Our imaging results revealed that cholesterol stimulation led to the formation of smaller TSPO aggregates and an increase in the point density on the cell membrane, indicating that cholesterol alters the aggregation pattern of TSPO. To further interpret these findings at the molecular level, we conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations across varying cholesterol concentrations. The simulations demonstrated that cholesterol inhibits TSPO dimerization by reducing the number of stable dimers, likely due to modifications in the local membrane environment and direct interactions with TSPO. Although the dSTORM and molecular dynamics results show differences in aggregate size and oligomerization behavior, both approaches highlight the complex regulatory role of cholesterol in TSPO organization. By integration of high-resolution imaging with computational modeling, this study provides new insights into the cholesterol-mediated modulation of TSPO dimerization, with implications for mitochondrial function and cholesterol homeostasis.

ABSTRACT:
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) determines epithelial ion secretion, which is fundamental in various organs. The synergy between cyclic AMP (cAMP) and Ca2+ signaling fine-tunes CFTR-mediated secretion; however, the organization of such signaling complexes and their physiological impact remained largely unknown. Here, we identified an apical membrane signaling complex consisting of secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA2), stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1)/calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (ORAI1), adenylyl cyclases, and CFTR. In this complex, SPCA2 facilitates constitutive, store-independent but STIM1-dependent ORAI1-mediated Ca2+ influx by activating ORAI1 and promoting STIM1/ORAI1 interaction, which is essential for basal CFTR function. Analysis by super-resolution dSTORM revealed constitutive organization of the proteins in a nanodomain on the apical membrane, which translates local Ca2+ increases to cAMP elevation and CFTR activation in unstimulated cells required for ion secretion. The same system operates in the pancreas, airways, and liver. Our findings reveal an essential, self-directing regulatory mechanism of CFTR-mediated ion secretion in secretory epithelial cells, independent from neurohormonal stimuli.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a robust wide-field optical nanoscopy technique. Several approaches are implemented to improve SIM's resolution capability (∼2-fold). However, achieving a high resolution with a large field of view (FOV) is still challenging. We present tilt-mirror-based multi-periodic SIM for large-FOV super-resolution microscopy. The sample is illuminated by a multi-periodic structured pattern generated by six-beam interference using a custom-designed mirror mount. We achieve 3.16-fold resolution improvement while using a 20×/0.40 numerical-aperture objective that supports a large FOV (0.53 mm × 0.34 mm). This overcomes the high-space-bandwidth product challenge, achieving 9.98-fold improvement. mMP-SIM decouples illumination and collection paths, enabling scalable super-resolution over a large FOV. By using a 28×/0.80 numerical-aperture objective lens, an optical resolution of 170 nm over a 0.40 mm × 0.25 mm imaging area is demonstrated. The proof-of-principle experimental demonstration is performed for both fluorescent beads and a biosample like U2OS (human bone osteosarcoma) cells.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) can achieve a 2 × resolution enhancement beyond the classical diffraction limit by employing illumination translations with respect to the object. This method has also been successfully implemented in a "blind" configuration, i.e., with unknown illumination patterns, allowing for more relaxed constraints on the control of illumination delivery. Here, we present a similar approach using what we believe to be a novel super-resolution algorithm that employs a generalized version of the popular Richardson-Lucy algorithm, alongside an optimized and customized optical setup. Both numerical and experimental validations demonstrate that our technique exhibits high noise resilience. Moreover, by implementing random translations instead of "ordered" ones, noise-related artifacts are reduced. These advancements enable wide-field super-resolved imaging with significantly reduced optical complexity.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a powerful method for high-resolution 3D-imaging that is compatible with standard fluorescence labeling techniques, as it provides optical sectioning as well as an up to twofold improvement of lateral resolution over widefield microscopy by combining illumination pattern diversity with computational reconstruction. We present a quantitative analysis of the image quality of 3D-SIM using the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR). In particular, we compare conventional woodpile illumination pattern based 3D-SIM, where the pattern is rotated and translated to acquire the set of raw images that is fed into the reconstruction algorithm, to (square or hexagonal) lattice 3D-SIM, where the pattern is only translated to assemble the input set of raw images. It appears that conventional 3D-SIM has better SSNR than the considered cases of lattice 3D-SIM. In addition, we have also analyzed the impact of the relative amplitude, angle of incidence and polarization of the set of illumination plane waves on image quality, and show how two SSNR derived metrics, SSNR volume and SSNR entropy, can be used to optimize these illumination pattern parameters.

ABSTRACT:
In this Letter, we propose a setup to realize quantitative and sensitive widefield microscopy of optical retardation and azimuth of a birefringent specimen at video rate. The originality of the technique lies in the spectral structuration of the microscope illumination using spectral coding of polarization. The optical retardation and azimuth map of the specimen are obtained from a combination of three intensity images captured after successive illumination of the microscope by three phase-shifted spectrally structured spectra from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The high commutation speed of the LEDs and the passive nature of all optical elements allow the acquisition at video rate and potentially more.

TITLE: Zero-Shot Learning for Limited Photon Budget Denoising in Structured Illumination Microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
The structured illumination microscopy (SIM) technique, when applied under low photon efficiency, provides an effective solution for rapid live-cell imaging, thereby enabling the investigation of dynamic cellular processes. However, noise interference during the acquisition process significantly hinders the reconstruction of SIM images, leading to substantial artifacts. To address this challenge, we propose a zero-shot learning-based SIM image denoising method (ZS-SIM). This approach relies solely on a single acquisition of noisy SIM data and achieves accurate denoising through neural network training. The original SIM image stack is downsampled and interpolated to complete the resampling process, while the traditional Wiener-SIM reconstruction method is integrated to ensure physical fidelity. We introduce a symmetric reconstruction loss and a mutual constraint SSIM loss that jointly enhance training stability and accelerate convergence, as demonstrated by our convergence analysis. ZS-SIM further achieves a favorable balance between denoising quality and computational efficiency, with low model complexity and fast inference speed, making it well-suited for practical deployment in microscopy workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that ZS-SIM efficiently and rapidly achieves artifact-free, high-fidelity denoising reconstruction, making it particularly well-suited for low-photon efficiency live-cell imaging and scenarios with limited computational resources. Furthermore, by extending the method to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data, we validate the effectiveness of ZS-SIM for SEM data denoising, significantly enhancing the performance of downstream segmentation tasks. We anticipate that ZS-SIM will play a pivotal role in low-photon efficiency imaging, driving advancements in this field and providing crucial support for rapid validation in biomedical research, thereby overcoming the challenges posed by acquisition noise.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) yields optically-sectioned images by projecting fringe patterns on a sample and laterally shifting the fringes three times. In this paper, we introduce a conditional framework entitled optically-sectioning diffusion (OSdiffuse) model for 3D microscopic imaging. This framework reconstructs a sectioned image using a single wide-field image as input. It effectively suppresses background noise similar to optical sectioning SIM (OS-SIM), but it reduces the data acquisition by threefold. Furthermore, the model enhances the axial sectioning capability twofold compared to the conventional OS-SIM approach. The effectiveness of the proposed mode was demonstrated with both simulations and experiments. We believe that the proposed method will be widely used in biological studies.

ABSTRACT:
A key factor for the survival of an organism in its habitat is its ability to quickly adapt to changes in its environment on the protein level. One fast and efficient mechanism to influence protein abundance is the regulation of mRNA stability by ribonucleases. In the prokaryotic model organism Bacillus subtilis, the membrane-anchored RNase Y performs a crucial regulatory role by degrading and maturating mRNA. Previous studies have shown that RNase Y acts in concert with three proteins forming the Y-complex. In addition to its role as specificity factor for RNase Y, ribonuclease-independent functions have been proposed for the Y-complex during natural competence, biofilm formation, as well as sporulation. In previous work, using single-molecule tracking, we showed that the Y-complex is highly dynamic and present in multiple compositions in vivo. Using biochemical analysis, recruitment of the Y-complex to RNase Y was shown to be mediated by YaaT whereas YlbF and YmcA did not display any direct interactions. Here we employ 3D- structured illumination microscopy (SIM) super resolution and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to further characterize RNase Y/ Y-complex localizations and interactions. By visualizing the Y-complex proteins and RNase Y using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we provide additional evidence that YaaT localizes differently than YmcA and YlbF, in that the fraction of YaaT is localized membrane-proximal appears to be higher than the one observed for YmcA and YlbF. We also show that the strength of YaaT membrane association is culture medium dependent. Evidence for membrane-proximal interaction of the Y-complex proteins with RNase Y is provided through the use of bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Taken together, our data support a model where the Y-complex is exclusively tethered to RNase Y by YaaT and where the composition of the Y-complex is fluctuating potentially in a function-dependent manner (Figure1).

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is a critical regulator of cellular homeostasis and an established biomarker in mitochondrial dysfunction. While super-resolution fluorescence imaging reveals intrinsic links between mitochondrial ultrastructure and function, prolonged monitoring of the dynamic ΔΨm remains constrained by the scarcity of photostable voltage-sensitive probes. Here, we designed and synthesized three water-soluble near-infrared boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) probes (o/m/pMePy-BDP). These cationic pyridinium-functionalized probes exhibit specific mitochondria localization (Pearson's colocalization coefficient >0.93), high photostability (<15% intensity loss after 15 min laser irradiation), and exceptional biocompatibility. When integrated with structured illumination microscopy (SIM), they resolved mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure at 0.24 μm resolution and captured real-time ΔΨm fluctuations during fusion/fission (∼15 mV shifts) and mitochondria-lysosome contact (MLC). Semiquantitative submitochondrial models further revealed voltage gradients (150-170 mV) across cristae junctions, challenging the classical "homogeneous ΔΨm" paradigm. The probes' compatibility with multiplexed imaging enabled continuous ΔΨm tracking during mitophagy, uncovering transient bioenergetic hotspots. This work bridges nanoscale mitochondrial dynamics to disease mechanisms, providing tools to dissect pathologies from neurodegeneration to cancer.

TITLE: Acid ceramidase as a novel target for adiponectin receptor agonist to abrogate podocyte NLRP3 inflammasome activation and glomerular inflammation during obesity.

ABSTRACT:
Adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) agonists protect against glomerular inflammation and injury in obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG), but their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Given the implication of the ceramide signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of ORG, the present study tested whether AdipoR agonists target acid ceramidase (AC) to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in podocytes, thereby blocking glomerular inflammation and injury during obesity. Confocal microscopy showed that adiponectin attenuated visfatin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β-containing multivesicular body (MVB) formation in podocytes. Nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed that adiponectin suppressed visfatin-induced extracellular vesicle release, an effect dependent on AC activity. Structured illumination microscopy demonstrated that visfatin reduced lysosome-MVB interaction in podocytes, which was restored by adiponectin via enhancement of TRPML1 channel-mediated Ca2+ release. The rescue of lysosome-MVB interaction and TRPML1 channel activity by adiponectin was mimicked by the AC enhancer but interfered with by the AC inhibitor. In vivo, high-fat diet (HFD) treatment induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and T cell infiltration in glomeruli and increased urinary extracellular vesicle excretion in mice, which were exaggerated by podocyte-specific Smpd1 gene (gene code of acid sphingomyelinase) overexpression in Smpd1trg/Podocre mice compared with WT/WT mice. AdipoRon, a synthetic AdipoR agonist, reduced HFD-induced glomerular inflammation in both WT/WT and Smpd1trg/Podocre mice, but its effect was blocked by AC inhibition. Moreover, podocyte-specific Smpd1 gene overexpression aggravated HFD-induced podocyte injury, proteinuria, and glomerular sclerosis, which were mitigated by AdipoRon in an AC-dependent manner. Additionally, we found that the protective actions of AdipoRon may be mainly attributed to the activation of AdipoR1, but not AdipoR2. Taken together, our findings suggest that AC activation mediates the protective effects of AdipoR agonists against glomerular inflammation and injury in ORG, highlighting AC as a potential therapeutic target. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study identifies acid ceramidase as a key mediator of adiponectin receptor agonist action in podocytes, linking its activation to suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome and extracellular vesicle release, and highlighting a novel therapeutic target in obesity-related kidney disease.

ABSTRACT:
4Pi single-molecule localization microscopy (4Pi-SMLM) achieves sub-10 nm isotropic three-dimensional resolution, representing a significant advancement in super-resolution imaging. However, traditional multicolor imaging techniques generally require additional modifications to the optical path, which complicates the system and leads to photon loss. In this study, we introduce a new, to the best of our knowledge, multicolor imaging method that leverages the differences in 4Pi-PSF size and interference fringe spacing caused by wavelength variations, enabling multicolor 4Pi-SMLM imaging without hardware modifications. This method captures color information directly from the raw data by utilizing wavelength-dependent point spread functions (PSFs). By globally fitting the data within multiple interference channels, we could achieve both high localization accuracy and color separation accuracy for single molecules of different colors.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), which has revolutionized nanoscale imaging, faces challenges in densely labelled samples due to fluorophore clustering, leading to compromised localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-assisted approach to address the issue of locating the clustered fluorophores. Our CNN is trained on a diverse data set of simulated SMLM images where it learns to predict point spread function (PSF) locations by generating Gaussian blobs as output. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate significant improvements in PSF localization accuracy, especially in densely labelled samples where traditional methods struggle. In addition, we employ blob detection as a post-processing technique to refine the predicted PSF locations and enhance localization precision. Our study underscores the efficacy of CNN in addressing clustering challenges in SMLM, thereby advancing spatial resolution and enabling deeper insights into complex biological structures.

ABSTRACT:
Microstructures arrayed over a substrate have shown increasing interest due to their ability to provide advanced 3D cellular models, which open up new possibilities for cell culture, proliferation, and differentiation. Still, the mechanisms by which physical cues impact the cell phenotype are not fully understood, hence the necessity to interrogate cell behavior at the highest resolution. However, cell 3D high-resolution optical imaging on such microstructured substrates remains challenging due to their complexity as well as axial calibration issues. In this work, we address this issue by leveraging the geometrical characteristics of fractal-like structures, which serve as axial calibration tools and modulate cell growth. To this end, we use multiscale 3D SiO2 substrates consisting of spatially arrayed octahedral features of a few micrometers to hundreds of nanometers. Through optimizations of both the structures and optical imaging conditions, we demonstrate the potential of these 3D multiscale structures as an alternative to electron microscopy for material imaging but also as calibration tools for 3D super-resolution microscopy. We used their multiscale and known geometry to perform lateral and axial calibrations in 3D single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and assess imaging resolutions. We then utilized these substrates as a platform for high-resolution bioimaging. As a proof of concept, we cultivate human mesenchymal stem cells on these substrates, revealing very different growth patterns compared to flat glass. Specifically, the spatial distribution of cytoskeleton proteins is vastly modified, as we demonstrate with a 3D SMLM assessment.

ABSTRACT:
Proteasomes are abundant molecular machines distributed throughout the eukaryotic cell to facilitate protein degradation. How their dynamic localization adapts to proteostasis requirements remains an area of active study. Recent studies from the authors show that proteotoxic stress induced by alpha-synuclein aggregates triggers proteasome reorganization into foci bodies, termed transient aggregate-associated droplets (TAADs). Here, advanced imaging and biophysical techniques are combined to examine proteasome reorganization and TAAD formation. Using single-molecule localization and light-sheet microscopy, redistribution of subcellular proteasome density is quantified in response to alpha-synuclein aggregates. Interestingly, the ratio of 20S proteasome core particles capped by 19S regulatory particles (∼60%) remains constant during proteotoxic stress. Delivery of aggregates by nanopipette injection reveals that TAAD formation is cytoskeleton-dependent, suggesting that directed transport is required for proteasome reorganization. Single-cell patch clamp further shows that cytoskeleton-dependent proteasome movement is linked to cell depolarization, implying that membrane potential can directly modulate proteasome localization. Single-particle tracking analysis detects the presence of both rapid- and slow-moving proteasome populations with proteotoxic stress shifting their motion towards confined diffusion within TAADs. Together, these results demonstrate that proteasomes adopt distinct modes of motion depending on cellular requirements and become restricted upon aggregate invasion, highlighting a tightly regulated system of proteasome organization for selective proteostasis during stress.

ABSTRACT:
Cardiovascular disease is frequent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); this risk increases further with peritoneal dialysis (PD), especially when high glucose degradation products (GDP) containing PD fluids (PDF) are used. We studied the spatial organization of the genome orchestrated by heterochromatin rearrangements (fluorescently labelled against H3K9me3 methylation sites) using super-resolution Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) and novel combined, mathematical approaches. These were based for geometry and clustering on Ripley statistics, and for topology on persistent homology, persistent imaging and principal component analysis. As a model system, endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to plasma from healthy and CKD individuals and to glucose-based PDF with different buffer and different GDP concentrations. H3K9me3 representing heterochromatin was clustering in endothelial cells. The clusters varied between CKD plasma donors, whereas PDF consistently increased endothelial heterochromatin relaxation and reduced H3K9me3 clustering, with significant differences based on the buffer and GDP content. Bicarbonate PDF with low-GDP concentrations induced high heterochromatin relaxation, i.e., unveiled most H3K9me3 molecules at the lowest level of relative clustering. Persistent homology varied between single and medium exposed cells, but varied less with PDF exposure. High-GDP PDF induced the highest degree of H3K9me3 disarrangement with the GDP 3,4-DGE dose-dependently increasing HC relaxation and lowering clustering to a level below controls. Structural heterochromatin (re-)organization of endothelial cells is variable in response to CKD plasma, while PDF induce major heterochromatin relaxation, depending on the buffer and GDP content, indicating additional chromatin accessibility related changes in genetic activity. Our findings provide a novel base for studying PD biocompatibility and vascular endothelial health.

ABSTRACT:
Accurately quantifying oxidative DNA damage at the single-cell level remains a major challenge due to the limitations of conventional ensemble-based assays, which obscure cell-to-cell variability and lack molecular specificity. To address this, we developed a super-resolution imaging strategy that combines an 8-oxo-dG-specific DNA aptamer with DNA-PAINT, enabling quantitative visualization of 8-oxo-dG lesions with ∼22 nm spatial resolution in individual cells. Our approach reliably detects 8-oxo-dG clusters, distinguishes oxidative damage levels across cells, and exhibits superior specificity and labeling efficiency compared to antibody-based methods. Furthermore, it enables direct evaluation of the repair efficiency of hOGG1 and its catalytic mutants at the single-cell level, overcoming the confounding effects of variable transfection efficiency. This method also serves as a platform for assessing the effects of pharmacological modulators and antioxidants on DNA repair. Looking forward, this strategy can be extended to map other small molecular targets, such as epigenetically modified DNA or RNA bases, with single-cell precision.

ABSTRACT:
DNA-PAINT (Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography) exploits the transient hybridization of a short fluorescent DNA imager strand to a complementary docking strand to achieve super-resolution imaging. However, its application is hampered by the background noise caused by unbound imager strands and the subsequent slow image acquisition. Several variants of DNA-PAINT have already been developed to successfully overcome these limitations. Here we design and validate a new alternative, based on intermolecular dark resonance energy transfer (DRET) and the use of a fluorenyl nucleobase (X) substitute incorporated into the imager strand, acting as a dark donor. Upon annealing, the fluorescence of the bright acceptor (ATTO 647N) bound to the docking strand is turned on via DRET with X. Single-molecule experiments showed that an 11 nt X-labeled imager strand provides appropriate hybridization rates with the ATTO 647N-labeled docking strand to perform DNA-PAINT. Thanks to their low background, high concentrations of imager strands can be used, facilitating the acquisition of super-resolved images of cellular microtubules within 30 s. This study provides the first proof-of-concept for this novel route to fast DNA-PAINT nanoscopy.

ABSTRACT:
DNA self-assembly of single molecules (i.e., dyes) with deterministic orientations is a powerful approach for engineering molecular excitons. However, current determination methods of the dye orientation relative to DNA do not account for the orientation of the dye plane, which is a missing degree of freedom needed to define absolute three-dimensional orientations. In this work, we combine fluorescence-detected linear dichroism, defocused dipole imaging, and DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) super-resolution microscopy to determine the absolute three-dimensional orientations of single Cy5 dyes relative to host DNA duplexes, which includes the dye plane orientation. The data revealed that the absorption and emission dipoles are perpendicular to the DNA duplex, and the mean dye plane is parallel to the DNA bases, which supports the notion that Cy5 dyes intercalate between DNA base pairs. The presented methodology will inspire investigation of the dye plane orientation for controlling dye arrangement configurations beyond spontaneous π-stacking between dyes as well as achieving novel dye-DNA arrangements.

ABSTRACT:
Lensless imaging microscopy has gained extensive application with the merits of system compactness and cost efficiency; however, its spatial resolution is usually compromised compared to conventional lens-based microscopes. To further enhance the spatial resolution, we built a lensless imaging system integrating a phase mask and a CMOS image sensor, and employed fluorescence fluctuation super-resolution microscopy (FF-SRM) algorithms to fully exploit the fluorescence intermittency (FI) characteristics of fluorescent molecules for high-resolution lensless image reconstruction. The study demonstrates that lensless image sequences processed by the Wiener deconvolution method can effectively retain the original fluorescence intermittency information, allowing for high-resolution reconstruction using FF-SRM algorithms. Furthermore, by combining expansion microscopy (ExM) and leveraging multi-algorithm synergy, we obtained additional improvements in spatial resolution and image quality for lensless imaging, facilitating clear visualization of biological subcellular organelles. This scheme offers a new pathway to achieve high spatial resolution imaging with practical advantages in simplicity and affordability.

ABSTRACT:
Dynamin family proteins typically do not depend on higher-order oligomerization; instead, dimerization and/or tetramerization is sufficient for their target membrane recruitment. Here, we demonstrate that dimerization/tetramerization alone is not enough, but self-assembly into a higher-order structure is also required for targeting a dynamin-related protein, dynamin-related protein 6 (Drp6), to the nuclear membrane. We identify residues 411-GKFR-414 as important for higher-order oligomerization of Drp6 but dispensable for its dimerization/tetramerization. Furthermore, while the mutation of GKFR residues does not affect membrane-binding ability in vitro, it inhibits the nuclear localization of Drp6 in vivo. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy and fast super-resolution live cell imaging demonstrate that the cytosolic, higher-order self-assembled structure of Drp6 is recruited to the nuclear envelope. These findings establish self-assembly into a higher-order oligomer as a prerequisite for target membrane recruitment of a dynamin-related protein.

ABSTRACT:
Advancement of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRM) has recently allowed applications to the biosensing by offering significant advantages over conventional methods. Its nanoscale spatial resolution and single-molecule sensitivity allow visualization and quantification of biomolecular targets without the need of signal amplification steps typically required in traditional biosensing methods. Moreover, recent innovations in probe design and imaging protocols have expanded SRM capabilities to enable dynamic biosensing in living cells, revealing molecular processes in their native cellular contexts. In this review, we discuss these applications of various SRM techniques to biosensing by highlighting their unique capabilities in providing spatial distribution information and high molecular sensitivity. We address several challenges that must be overcome for the broader application of SRM-based biosensing. Finally, we discuss perspectives on future directions for advancing this field towards practical applications.

ABSTRACT:
Mode of interaction between fluorescent probe and local binding site on fibril architecture is central to the design of efficient amyloid sensors. SYPRO orange (SO) is reported to have two binding modes with two distinct binding configurations, namely weakly bound inclined and strongly bound surface hugging populations. Though two distinct sites for non-radiative relaxation, i.e. central π-bridge site and the electron donor amino site is evident from the molecular framework, it is unclear which site dictates fluorescence enhancement upon binding. We recommend employing the inherent sensitivity of fluorescence lifetime to alterations in non-radiative pathways for different binding configurations. In this contribution an attempt has been made to segregate binding activated single molecule bursts recorded with pulsed excitation into requisite weak and strong binding events, which were subsequently correlated with their corresponding excited state lifetimes. Comparison of fluorescence decays for these two binding modes suggest minor role of non-radiative relaxation at π-bridge site in deciding excited state decay of bound SO molecules. On the contrary, plausible hydrophobic interaction of aliphatic tails at the electron donor site with the fibril imparts configurational restrain at the amino group site, hindering its non-radiative pathways leading to increased fluorescence intensity and lifetime. This sensing behaviour of SO is consistent for fibrils of amyloidogenic proteins lysozyme and insulin. Present work has the relevance in the rational design of amyloid sensor as well as better super-resolution imaging probes for localization microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Precise metrology and defect characterization are essential for ensuring device performance and yield as semiconductor manufacturing pushes critical dimensions into the nanoscale regime. In this regard, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRM) has recently gained attention as a powerful tool, providing nanoscale resolution essential for advanced device fabrication. However, conventional SRM techniques often rely on fluorescent labeling, which could introduce chemical complexity, alter material properties, and limit semiconductor-processing compatibility while also imposing resolution constraints owing to the size of the fluorescent tag. To address these challenges, we introduce a new super-resolution label-free imaging approach for silica-based nanomaterials based on the photoluminescence generated from the formation of nonbridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHCs) in silica. These intrinsic defects exhibit strong photoluminescence that is significantly enhanced through electron illumination and thiol treatment, thereby enabling subdiffraction imaging without the need for complex molecular labels. Furthermore, we reconstructed super-resolution images of silica nanostructures with significantly improved spatial resolution through the use of fluctuation-based super-resolution image analysis. We show that this method effectively resolves silica-based semiconductor nanopatterns in a manner that delivers high contrast and spatial resolution by highlighting the NBOHC-regeneration potential for advancing semiconductor metrology. Also, we demonstrate that our method enables high-contrast and highly sensitive visualization of various nanoscale defects on patterned silica surfaces, highlighting its strong potential as a powerful, nondestructive tool for nanoscale defect detection in semiconductor pattern inspection. Ultimately, the developed method is expected to provide a promising approach that can be broadly used to structurally characterize various inorganic nanomaterials at the nanoscale.

ABSTRACT:
Doughnut-shaped vortex beams are widely used to enhance lateral resolution in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and subtractive second harmonic generation microscopy. The influence of polarisation states on the axial point spread function is investigated theoretically and experimentally in subtractive second harmonic generation microscopy using a first-order Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beam. The influence of left-handed circular, right-handed circular and linear polarised states are analysed for second harmonic generation imaging and compared with results of fluorescence imaging. The results exhibit great agreement with theoretical predictions, and demonstrate the superiority of left-handed circular polarisation in achieving a complete dark central spot and an extended axial point spread function.

ABSTRACT:
Nanoparticle diffusion in 3D porous structures is critical to understanding natural and synthetic systems but remains underexplored due to limitations in traditional microscopy methods. Here, 3D Single-Molecule Active-feedback Real-time Tracking (3D-SMART) microscopy is used to resolve nanoparticle dynamics in agarose gels with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. This highlights "hopping diffusion", where particles intermittently escape confinement pockets, providing insights into hydrogel microstructure. Long, highly sampled trajectories enable the extraction of kinetic parameters, confinement sizes, and thermodynamic barriers. This study demonstrates 3D-SMART's ability to probe particle-environment interactions at super-resolution (≈10 nm in XY and ≈30 nm in Z) in 3D, offering new perspectives on nanoparticle diffusion and the structural dynamics of porous materials, with implications for drug delivery, material science, and biological systems.

ABSTRACT:
The behavior of proteins and other biomolecules in cellular environments is governed by complex molecular processes. Understanding their temporal dynamics and interactions with other biomolecules or cellular structures is essential for elucidating physiological functions. Single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM) has emerged as a powerful single-molecule technique for investigating these processes with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. In this Expert View, we introduce sptPALM with a special focus on its application in the plasma membrane of plant cells. Key aspects and advances of the technique, including instrumentation and data analysis, are discussed to equip researchers with the foundational knowledge required to establish and execute sptPALM experiments. Recent studies are highlighted to demonstrate the potential of sptPALM to advance our understanding of molecular dynamics in plant cells.

ABSTRACT:
As an inherent characteristic of light fields, chirality possesses extensive potential applications in nanofabrication, optical communication, optical tweezers, etc. However, the investigation of multi-parameter modulation (phase, intensity, polarization, etc.) and chiral switching remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose and fabricate a multifunctional liquid crystal device (LCD) based on photoalignment technology. By combining various vortices along the radial direction, a new optical phase plate is designed to modulate the light field, exhibiting distinct chiral states during propagation with simple optical transformation. Through tight focusing, the modulated light beam demonstrates intensity chirality switching, while phase chirality switching can be achieved through radial axial transformation. Benefiting from the advantages of LCD devices, such as large size, broad spectral range, low cost, and electronically controlled, the generated chiral-switching light enables facile and multifunctional manipulation of its chiral structures, with significant potential for scientific applications, including material chirality detection and photoactivated localization super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
The extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin C (TnC) is implicated in a variety of processes ranging from cell proliferation and adhesion to synaptic plasticity. The contribution of TnC to neurogenesis related processes in the adult hippocampus, however, remains unclear. To address this question, hippocampal sections were immunostained for the proliferation marker Ki67 and for neuroblast marker doublecortin (DCX). Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that TnC - deficiency does not alter either the size of Ki67+ or DCX + cellular populations in the subgranular zone (SGZ) compared to the control animals. Super-resolution Airyscan confocal microscopy enabled the investigation of the complexity of dendritic trees of DCX + cells with the analysis of the dendritic tree complexity parameters. The results show that the dendritic tree complexity of developing neurons is not dependent on the presence of TnC. However, reinforcement of adult neurogenesis by the exposure to enriched environment (EE) revealed that TnC- deficient mice have a reduced number of DCX + cells compared to wild type littermates. This study indicates that TnC might not contribute to the basal levels of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, while on the other hand it gains importance in the generation of the positive effect of EE.

ABSTRACT:
Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) present prevalent vascular diseases of the central nervous system, which can result in hemorrhage and seizures. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic with established safety profiles, demonstrates pleiotropic effects, including the inhibition of cellular proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis, all of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of CCM. However, the therapeutic benefits of metformin in the realm of CCM remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of metformin on the growth of CCM lesions in Slco1c1 CreERT2; Pdcd10 fl/fl (Pdcd10BECKO) mice. Super-resolution confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to evaluate mitochondrial structure. The results showed that metformin administration significantly attenuated CCM lesion burden, reduced iron deposition, and decreased collagen accumulation in Pdcd10BECKO mice. Metformin also normalized the defects from PDCD10 deficiency, including disruption of tight junctions and excessive proliferation of endothelial cells. Moreover, metformin significantly improved mitochondrial structural anomalies and dysfunction associated with PDCD10 deficiency, characterized by the presence of mitochondrial puncta and the loss of cristae, followed by impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitoROS in endothelial cells with the mutation. Metformin provided these beneficial effects by downregulating KLF4. In conclusion, these findings indicate that metformin suppresses the development of CCM in Pdcd10BECKO mice by targeting KLF4-mediated mitochondrial damage, thereby providing promising prospects as a novel therapeutic approach for CCM.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) excels in studying dynamic biomolecules by allowing precise observation of their conformational changes over time. To monitor RNA dynamics with smFRET, we developed a method to covalently label RNAs at their termini with a FRET pair of fluorophores. This direct end-labeling strategy targets the 5'-phosphate by carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activation and the 3'-ribose by periodate oxidation, which can be adapted to other RNAs regardless of their size and sequence to study them independently of artificial modifications. Furthermore, the 5'-EDC/NHS activation is of general interest to all nucleic acids with a 5'-phosphate. The use of commercially available chemicals eliminates the need to synthesize RNA-specific probes. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy requires the surface-immobilized molecules of interest to be within the evanescent field to be illuminated. A sophisticated way of keeping the RNA molecules within the evanescent field is to encapsulate them in phospholipid vesicles. Encapsulation benefits from the best of both worlds, tethering the molecule to the surface while enabling free diffusion of the molecule. We ensure that each vesicle contains only a single RNA molecule, enabling single-molecule imaging. Upon dual-end labeling and encapsulation of the RNA of interest, smFRET measurements offer a dynamic and detailed view of RNA behavior.

ABSTRACT:
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have an outstanding capacity to regenerate different organs and appendages. Bone regeneration in zebrafish has been studied using different methods such as fin amputation, scale plucking, skull trepanation, and microscopic approaches. Using a confocal laser scanning setup equipped with a two-photon laser, a laser ablation method was developed as a lesion paradigm to ablate bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) in the developing opercle of zebrafish larvae. The method described here allows the ablation of cells in a precise manner, as the area, shape, and depth can be finely adjusted. In addition, this method allows imaging of the area before and just after the ablation, so that short-term effects of the injury can be analyzed. In this experimental setup, the immune response after ablation of osteoblasts in the injured area was studied. An increase in the recruitment of macrophages was observed after ablation, indicating the relevance of their presence during bone regeneration.

ABSTRACT:
Technical hurdles in a culture of epithelial cells include dedifferentiation and loss of function. Biomimetic three-dimensional (3D) cell culture methods can enhance cell culture efficiency. This study introduces an advanced two-layered culture system intended to cultivate epithelial cells as tissue-like layers with the culture of fibroblasts within a 3D environment. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibrous membranes (NMs) were fabricated via electrospinning and utilized as a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix for the culture of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, respectively. In the upper insert wells, lung epithelial cells were cultivated on the PVA NM, and in the lower chambers, fibroblasts were cultured on the PCL NM. This configuration eliminates direct cell-cell contact and facilitates the examination of paracrine signaling mediated by soluble factors. Confocal microscopy was employed to analyze the distribution, growth pattern, and expression of intracellular proteins, including zona occludens in epithelial cells. Z-stacking techniques enabled detailed 3D reconstructions, providing precise insights into the integrity of tight junctions and spatial organization within the epithelial layer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) assessed the morphological characteristics of cell types on the nanofibrous membranes. SEM imaging revealed intricate cell surface structures and interactions with the nanofibers, offering a comprehensive perspective on cellular architecture and cell interaction with nanofibrous structure. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay is a simple method for measuring epithelial cell and fibroblast growth rates over time. It provides the proliferative behaviors and potential synergistic effects of coculturing these cells. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a simple insert co-culture system for simultaneous culture of fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which is crucial in various physiological and pharmacological contexts, including epithelial tissue regeneration, tumor microenvironment with endothelial, immune, and other stroma cells, toxicity assay, and drug activity test.

ABSTRACT:
The DNA damage response is a genetic information safeguard that protects cells from perpetuating damaged DNA. The characterization of the proteins that cooperate in this process allows the identification of alternative targets for therapeutic intervention in several diseases, such as cancer, aging-related diseases, and chronic inflammation. The Proximity Ligand Assay (PLA) emerged as a tool for estimating interaction between proteins as well as spatial proximity among organelles or cellular structures and allows the temporal localization and co-localization analysis under stress conditions, for instance. The method is simple because it is similar to conventional immunofluorescence and allows the staining of an organelle, cellular structure, or a specific marker such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, PML bodies, or DNA double-strand marker, yH2AX simultaneously. The phosphorylation of the S139 at Histone 2A variant, H2AX, then referred to as yH2AX, is widely used as a very sensitive and specific marker of DNA double-strand breaks. Each focus of yH2AX staining corresponds to one break in DNA that occurs a few minutes after the damage. The analysis of changes in yH2AX foci is the most common assay for studying if the protein of interest is implicated in DNA damage response (DDR). Whether a direct role in the DNA damage site is expected, fluorescence microscopy is used to verify the colocalization of the protein of interest with yH2AX foci. However, except for the new super-resolution fluorescence methods, to conclude, the local interaction with DNA damage sites can be a little subjective. Here, we show an assay to evaluate the localization of proteins in the DDR pathway using yH2AX as a marker of the damage site. This assay can be used to characterize the temporal localization under different insults that cause DNA damage.

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of weight-based tube voltage and iodine delivery rate (IDR) for coronary artery CT angiography (CCTA). METHODS: A total of 193 patients (mean age: 58 ± 12 years) with suspected coronary heart disease indicated for CCTA between May and October 2022 were prospectively enrolled. The subjects were divided into five groups according to body weight: < 60 kg, 60 – 69 kg, 70 – 79 kg, 80 – 89 kg, and ≥ 90 kg. The tube voltage and IDR settings of each group were as follows: 70 kVp/0.8 gI/s, 80 kVp/1.0 gI/s, 80 kVp/1.1 gI/s, 100 kVp/1.5 gI/s, and 100 kVp/1.5 gI/s, respectively. Objective image quality data included the CT value and standard deviation (noise) of the aortic root (AR), the proximal left anterior descending branch (LAD), and the distal right coronary artery (RCA), as well as the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the LAD and RCA. Subjective image quality assessment was performed based on the 18-segment model. Contrast and radiation doses, as well as effective dose (ED), were recorded. All continuous variables were compared using either the one-way ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in all objective and subjective parameters of image quality between the groups (P > 0.05). However, significant differences in contrast and radiation doses were observed (P < 0.05). The contrast doses across the weight groups were 27 mL, 35 mL, 38 mL, 53 mL, and 53 mL, respectively, while the ED were 1.567 (1.30, 2.197) mSv, 1.53 (1.373, 1.78) mSv, 2.113 (1.963, 2.256) mSv, 4.22 (3.771, 4.483) mSv, and 4.786 (4.339, 5.536) mSv, respectively. CONCLUSION: Weight-based tube voltage and IDR yielded consistently high image quality, and allowed for further reduction in contrast and radiation exposure during CCTA for coronary artery diseases.

TITLE: Improving STED microscopy with SUPPOSe: enhancing resolution from a single-image.
AUTHORS: Toscani Micaela, Lacapmesure Axel M
JOURNAL: Methods and applications in fluorescence (2024)
PMID: 38457832
DOI: 10.1088/2050-6120/ad31b8

ABSTRACT:
Here we apply the SUPPOSe algorithm on images acquired using Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy with the aim of improving the resolution limit achieved. We processed images of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) from cell lines in which the Nup96 nucleoporin was endogenously labeled. This reference protein forms a ring whose diameter is ∼107 nm with 8 corners ∼42 nm apart from each other. The stereotypic arrangement of proteins in the NPC has been used as reference structures to characterize the performance of a variety of microscopy techniques. STED microscopy images resolve the ring arrangement but not the eightfold symmetry of the NPC. After applying the SUPPOSe algorithm to the STED images, we were able to solve the octagonal structure of the NPC. After processing 562 single NPC, the average radius of the NPC was found to beR= 54.2 ± 2.9 nm, being consistent with the theoretical distances of this structure. To verify that the solutions obtained are compatible with a NPC-type geometry, we rotate the solutions to optimally fit an eightfold-symmetric pattern and we count the number of corners that contain at least one localization. Fitting a probabilistic model to the histogram of the number of bright corners gives an effective labeling efficiency of 31%, which is in agreement with the values reported in for other cell lines and ligands used in Single Molecule Localization microscopy, showing that SUPPOSe can reliably retrieve sub-resolution, nanoscale objects from single acquisitions even in noisy conditions.

ABSTRACT:
Microscopes generally achieve better 2D imaging compared to 3D, and super-resolution microscopes often aggravate such axial-lateral resolution mismatch. A prime example is vortex phase-based stimulated emission depletion (STED) fluorescence microscopy, which only narrows the point-spread function laterally, thereby increasing the point-spread function (PSF) anisotropy. In this study, we developed a semi-analytical theory based on the Nijboer-Zernike expansion, developed a set of metrics and performed experiments to establish the merits of the alternative, bivortex phase-based, coherent-hybrid STED. We find that this mode reduces the axial-lateral resolution mismatch by providing access to PSF geometries that are strictly forbidden to the two conventional single-beam modes, emulating noisier multi-beam approaches. Both theory and experiment indicate that bivortex STED not only addresses the axial-lateral resolution gap but also delivers a higher signal-to-background ratio than the two more common STED modes that it bridges.

ABSTRACT:
Air pollution is an environmental factor associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, characterized by decreased cognitive abilities and memory. The limited models of sporadic Alzheimer's disease fail to replicate all pathological hallmarks of the disease, making it challenging to uncover potential environmental causes. Environmentally driven models of Alzheimer's disease are thus timely and necessary. We used live-cell confocal fluorescent imaging combined with high-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to follow the response of retinoic acid-differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to nanomaterial exposure. Here, we report that exposure of the cells to some particulate matter constituents reproduces a neurodegenerative phenotype, including extracellular amyloid beta-containing plaques and decreased neurite length. Consistent with the existing in vivo research, we observed detrimental effects, specifically a substantial reduction in neurite length and formation of amyloid beta plaques, after exposure to iron oxide and diesel exhaust particles. Conversely, after exposure to engineered cerium oxide nanoparticles, the lengths of neurites were maintained, and almost no extracellular amyloid beta plaques were formed. Although the exact mechanism behind this effect remains to be explained, the retinoic acid differentiated SH-SY5Y cell in vitro model could serve as an alternative, environmentally driven model of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.

Super-resolution imaging techniques have fundamentally changed our understanding of cellular architecture and dynamics by surpassing the diffraction limit and enabling the visualization of subcellular details. The popular super-resolution method known as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) relies on the exact localization of single fluorescent molecules. The significance of employing Vectashield as a mounting medium for the super-resolution imaging scheme called direct STORM has recently been explored. Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647), one of the most popular dyes, shows significant blinking in Vectashield. However, to observe prominent blinking of the fluorophore for the reconstruction of super-resolved images, the power of the excitation laser needs to be tuned. This work demonstrates the tuning of excitation power density in the sample plane for superior imaging performance using AF647 in Vectashield. Samples comprising MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line are used for the experiments. The actin filaments of the cell are stained with phalloidin-conjugated AF647 dye. For the experiment, we employ a low-cost openFrame-based STORM system equipped with a programmable Arduino-regulated laser source emitting at 638 nm. An excitation power density of 0.60 kW/cm2 at 638 nm in the sample plane is observed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, the number of switching events, and the number of photons detected per event during image acquisition, thereby leading to the best imaging performance in terms of resolution. The outcome of this work will promote further STORM-based super-resolved imaging applications in cell biology using Alexa Fluor 647 in Vectashield.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a widely applied fluorescence super-resolution imaging technique. It can also serve as high-throughput imaging in coherent imaging systems. However, coherent SIM requires additional qualitative/quantitative phase imaging methods to acquire phase information. This paper proposes a structured illumination microscopy technique based on the Kramers-Kronig relations (KK-SIM) that achieves quantitative phase imaging without the need for extra technical assistance and relies solely on the spatial-domain intensity images reconstructed through conventional SIM. KK-SIM utilizes a non-iterative approach to recover intensity into amplitude and phase, maintaining SIM's high acquisition speed and reconstruction efficiency. Our work enables high-throughput quantitative phase imaging using conventional SIM experimental setups and data post-processing, making SIM suitable for label-free, noninvasive dynamic observation.

ABSTRACT:
Multifocal structured illumination microscopy (MSIM) is a popular super-resolution imaging technique known for its good probe compatibility, low laser power requirements, and improved imaging depth, making it widely applicable in biomedical research. However, the speed of MSIM imaging is typically constrained by the approaches employed to generate and scan the laser foci across the sample. In this study, we propose a flexible two-photon excitation MSIM method using a pair of acousto-optic deflectors. By adopting addressable scanning (AS) and synchronized capturing, MSIM super-resolution imaging can be performed in multiple discrete regions of interest (ROIs) within the field of view. Notably, this AS-MSIM scheme not only enhances the speed of MSIM imaging but also alleviates photobleaching and phototoxicity to biological samples. We demonstrate its potential by achieving super-resolution imaging of selected mitochondria within cells at a frame rate of 4 Hz. Furthermore, we deliberate the possibility of even faster imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Light scattering from the sample is an unavoidable problem in fluorescence imaging. Compared with laser scanning confocal scanning microscopy, although optical-sectioning structured illumination microscopy (OS-SIM) has the advantages of fast imaging speed and low phototoxicity, it faces the challenge of removing the scattering fluorescent noise particularly when imaging thick and densely labeled sampling. To improve the imaging performance of OS-SIM, we introduce the concept of confocal imaging to OS-SIM and propose confocal structured illumination microscopy (CSIM). CSIM exploits the principle of dual imaging to reconstruct a dual image from each camera pixel. The scattered fluorescent noise and the unscattered fluorescent signal recorded by the camera pixel are separated in the reconstructed dual image. By extracting the unscattered fluorescent signal from each dual image based on the conjugate relationship between the camera and the spatial light modulator, we can eliminate the scattered fluorescent noise and reconstruct a confocal image. We have built the theoretical framework of CSIM. Experimental results of fluorescent optical-sectioning demonstrate that CSIM achieves a superior performance in eliminating scattered fluorescent noise and in extending imaging depth compared with existing OS-SIM. CSIM is expected to broaden the application range of OS-SIM.

ABSTRACT:
Traditional camera-based single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), with its high imaging resolution and localization throughput, has made significant advancements in biological and chemical researches. However, due to the limitation of the fluorescence signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a single molecule, its resolution is difficult to reach to 5 nm. Optical lattice produces a nondiffracting beam pattern that holds the potential to enhance microscope performance through its high contrast and penetration depth. Here, we propose a new method named LatticeFLUX which utilizes the wide-field optical lattice pattern illumination for individual molecule excitation and localization. We calculated the Cramér-Rao lower bound of LatticeFLUX resolution and proved that our method can improve the single molecule localization precision by 2.4 times compared with the traditional SMLM. We propose a scheme using 9-frame localization, which solves the problem of uneven lattice light illumination. Based on the experimental single-molecule fluorescence SNR, we coded the image reconstruction software to further verify the resolution enhancement capability of LatticeFLUX on simulated punctate DNA origami, line pairs, and cytoskeleton. LatticeFLUX confirms the feasibility of using 2D structured light illumination to obtain high single-molecule localization precision under high localization throughput. It paves the way for further implementation of ultra-high resolution full 3D structured-light-illuminated SMLM.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence imaging is an invaluable tool to study biological processes, and fluorogenic dyes are crucial to enhance cell permeability and target intracellular structures with high specificity. Polymethine dyes are vitally important fluorophores in single-molecule localization microscopy and in vivo imaging, but their use in live cells has been limited by high background fluorescence and low membrane permeability. Here, we present a general strategy to transform polymethine compounds into fluorogenic dyes by implementing a 5-exo-trig ring-closure. This method provides access to bright, fluorogenic polymethine dyes with emissions across the visible and near-infrared spectrum.

ABSTRACT:
A new acquisition framework for MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy is proposed, termed Vortex Interference MINFLUX (viMINFLUX). From our analysis, we showed that by utilizing vortex interference, the scan range and phase shift mutually modulate MINFLUX precision, resulting in a precision enhancement by a factor of two or more for the same scan range. We further showed that vortex interference can be extended to 3D imaging, whereby 3D viMINFLUX provides for nearly isotropic 3D precision, resulting in a two-fold improvement in lateral precision and a five-fold enhancement in axial precision compared to conventional 3D MINFLUX techniques.

ABSTRACT:
Two-photon excitation microscopy enables in vivo deep-tissue imaging within organisms. This technique is based on two-photon excitation, a nonlinear optical process that uses near-infrared light for excitation, resulting in high tissue permeability. Notably, two-photon excitation occurs only near the focal plane; therefore, minimally invasive tomographic images can be obtained. Owing to these features, two-photon excitation microscopy is currently widely used in medical and life-science research, particularly in the domain of neuroscience for in vivo visualization of deep tissues. However, the use of long-wavelength excitation light in two-photon excitation microscopy has resulted in a larger focused spot size and relatively low spatial resolution, which is a limitation of this technique for further applications. Recent studies have described super-resolution microscopy techniques applied to two-photon excitation microscopy in an attempt to observe living organisms "as they are in their natural state" with high spatial resolution. We have also addressed this topic using an optical approach (two-photon stimulated emission depletion microscopy) and an image analysis approach (two-photon super-resolution radial fluctuation). Here, we describe these approaches together with a discussion of our recent accomplishments.

ABSTRACT:
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is only present in mammals and has a thermogenic function. Brown adipocytes are characterized by a multilocular cytoplasm with multiple lipid droplets, a central nucleus, a high mitochondrial content, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). BAT has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and its associated metabolic disorders due to its ability to dissipate metabolic energy as heat. To investigate BAT function and regulation, brown adipocyte culturing is indispensable. The present protocol optimizes tissue processing and cell differentiation for culturing brown adipocytes from newborn mice. Additionally, procedures for the imaging of differentiated adipocytes with both confocal immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy are shown. In the brown adipocytes differentiated with the techniques described herein, the major defining features of classical BAT are preserved, including high UCP1 levels, increased mitochondrial mass, and very close physical contact between the lipid droplets and mitochondria, making this method a valuable tool for BAT studies.

ABSTRACT:
Presented is a protocol for visualizing and quantifying a specific protein in cells at the cellular level for the marine cyanobacterium Crocosphaera watsonii, a crucial primary producer and nitrogen fixer in oligotrophic oceans. One of the challenges for marine autotrophic N2 fixers (diazotrophs) is distinguishing probe-derived fluorescence signals from autofluorescence. C. watsonii was selected to represent chlorophyll-, phycoerythrin- and phycourobilin-containing cyanobacteria. The protocol allows for simple and semi-quantitative visualization of proteins in C. watsonii at a single-cell level, enabling investigation of protein production under different environmental conditions to evaluate the metabolic activities of the target cyanobacteria. Furthermore, the fixation and permeabilization methods are optimized to enhance the fluorescence signals from target proteins to distinguish them from autofluorescence, especially from phycoerythrin and phycourobilin. The enhanced signal can be visualized using confocal or widefield fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, fluorescence intensity was semi-quantified using Fiji software. This single-cell analysis workflow allows the evaluation of cell-to-cell variations of specific protein content. The protocol can be performed in any life science laboratory as it requires only standard equipment and can also be easily adapted to other phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacterial cells.

ABSTRACT:
Oocytes are amongst the biggest and most long-lived cells in the female body. They are formed in the ovaries during embryonic development and remain arrested at the prophase of meiosis I. The quiescent state may last for years until the oocytes receive a stimulus to grow and obtain the competency to resume meiosis. This protracted state of arrest makes them extremely susceptible to accumulating DNA-damaging insults, which affect the genetic integrity of the female gametes and, therefore, the genetic integrity of the future embryo. Consequently, the development of an accurate method to detect DNA damage, which is the first step for the establishment of DNA damage response mechanisms, is of vital importance. This paper describes a common protocol to test the presence and progress of DNA damage in prophase-arrested oocytes during a period of 20 h. Specifically, we dissect mouse ovaries, retrieve the cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs), remove the cumulus cells from the COCs, and culture the oocytes in Μ2 medium containing 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine to maintain the state of arrest. Thereafter, the oocytes are treated with the cytotoxic, antineoplasmic drug, etoposide, to engender double-strand breaks (DSBs). By using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we detect and quantify the levels of the core protein γH2AX, which is the phosphorylated form of the histone H2AX. H2AX becomes phosphorylated at the sites of DSBs after DNA damage. The inability to restore DNA integrity following DNA damage in oocytes can lead to infertility, birth defects, and increased rates of spontaneous abortions. Therefore, the understanding of DNA damage response mechanisms and, at the same time, the establishment of an intact method for studying these mechanisms are essential for reproductive biology research.

TITLE: Simple Establishment of a Vascularized Osteogenic Bone Marrow Niche Using Pre-Cast Poly(ethylene Glycol) (PEG) Hydrogels in an Imaging Microplate.

ABSTRACT:
The bone and bone marrow are highly vascularized and structurally complex organs, and are sites for cancer and metastasis formation. In vitro models recapitulating bone- and bone marrow-specific functions, including vascularization, that are compatible with drug screening are highly desirable. Such models can bridge the gap between simplistic, structurally irrelevant two-dimensional (2D) in vitro models and the more expensive, ethically challenging in vivo models. This article describes a controllable three-dimensional (3D) co-culture assay based on engineered poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) matrices for the generation of vascularized, osteogenic bone-marrow niches. The PEG matrix design allows the development of 3D cell cultures through a simple cell seeding step requiring no encapsulation, thus enabling the development of complex co-culture systems. Furthermore, the matrices are transparent and pre-cast onto glass-bottom 96-well imaging plates, rendering the system suitable for microscopy. For the assay described here, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) are cultured first until a sufficiently developed 3D cell network is formed. Subsequently, GFP-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are added. The culture development is followed by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. The presence of the hBM-MSC network supports the formation of vascular-like structures that otherwise would not form and that remain stable for at least 7 days. The extent of vascular-like network formation can easily be quantified. This model can be tuned toward an osteogenic bone-marrow niche by supplementing the culture medium with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which promotes the osteogenic differentiation of the hBM-MSCs, as assessed by increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity at day 4 and day 7 of co-culture. This cellular model can be used as a platform for culturing various cancer cells and studying how they interact with bone- and bone marrow-specific vascular niches. Moreover, it is suitable for automation and high-content analyses, meaning it would enable cancer drug screening under highly reproducible culture conditions.

ABSTRACT:
Objective. X-ray phase contrast imaging is a promising technique for future clinical diagnostic as it can provide enhanced contrast in soft tissues compared to traditional x-ray attenuation-contrast imaging. However, the strict requirements on the x-ray coherence and the precise alignment of optical elements limit its applications towards clinical use. To solve this problem, mesh-based x-ray phase contrast imaging method with one hexagonal mesh is proposed for easy alignment and better image visualization.Approach. The mesh produces structured illuminations and the detector captures its distortions to reconstruct the absorption, differential phase contrast (DPC) and dark-field (DF) images of the sample. In this work, we fabricated a hexagonal mesh to simultaneously retrieve DPC and DF signals in three different directions with single shot. A phase retrieval algorithm to obtain artifacts-free phase from DPC images with three different directions is put forward and false color dark-field image is also reconstructed with tri-directional images. Mesh-shifting method based on this hexagonal mesh modulator is also proposed to reconstruct images with better image quality at the expense of increased dose.Main results. In numerical simulations, the proposed hexagonal mesh outperforms the traditional square mesh in image evaluation metrics performance and false color visualization with the same radiation dose. The experimental results demonstrate its feasiblity in real imaging systems and its advantages in quantitive imaging and better visualization. The proposed hexagonal mesh is easy to fabricate and can be successfully applied to x-ray source with it spot size up to 300μm.Significance. This work opens new possibilities for quantitative x-ray non-destructive imaging and may also be instructive for research fields such as x-ray structured illumination microscopy (SIM), x-ray spectral imaging and x-ray phase contrast and dark-field computed tomography (CT).

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution microscopy methods enable the visualization of biological processes on the level of a few nanometers. However, the application of these techniques in biological systems is limited by the availability of small affinity reagents. Slow off-rate-modified aptamers as nucleic acid analogues to antibodies have been successfully applied to improve the resolution and quantification of DNA-PAINT. In this chapter, we describe a protocol for using SOMAmers as labeling reagents for super-resolution microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Volumetric fluorescence microscopy has a great demand for high-resolution (HR) imaging and comes at the cost of sophisticated imaging solutions. Image super-resolution (SR) methods offer an effective way to recover HR images from low-resolution (LR) images. Nevertheless, these methods require pixel-level registered LR and HR images, posing a challenge in accurate image registration. To address these issues, we propose a novel registration-free image SR method. Our method conducts SR training and prediction directly on unregistered LR and HR volume neuronal images. The network is built on the CycleGAN framework and the 3D UNet based on attention mechanism. We evaluated our method on LR (5×/0.16-NA) and HR (20×/1.0-NA) fluorescence volume neuronal images collected by light-sheet microscopy. Compared to other super-resolution methods, our approach achieved the best reconstruction results. Our method shows promise for wide applications in the field of neuronal image super-resolution.

ABSTRACT:
Advances in the knowledge of the neuroendocrine system are closely related to the development of cellular imaging and labeling techniques. This synergy ranges from the staining techniques that allowed the first characterizations of the anterior pituitary gland, its relationship with the hypothalamus, and the birth of neuroendocrinology; through the development of fluorescence microscopy applications, specific labeling strategies, transgenic systems, and intracellular calcium sensors that enabled the study of processes and dynamics at the cellular and tissue level; until the advent of super-resolution microscopy, miniscopes, optogenetics, fiber photometry, and other imaging methods that allowed high spatiotemporal resolution and long-term three-dimensional cellular activity recordings in living systems in a conscious and freely moving condition. In this review, we briefly summarize the main contributions of cellular imaging techniques that have allowed relevant advances in the field of neuroendocrinology and paradigm shifts that have improved our understanding of the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axes. The development of these methods and equipment is the result of the integration of knowledge achieved by the integration of several disciplines and effort to solve scientific questions and problems of high impact on health and society that this system entails.

ABSTRACT:
Recent advances in optical bioimaging and optogenetics have enabled the visualization and manipulation of biological phenomena, including cellular activities, in living animals. In the field of neuroscience, detailed neural activity related to brain functions, such as learning and memory, has now been revealed, and it has become feasible to artificially manipulate this activity to express brain functions. However, the conventional evaluation of neural activity by two-photon Ca2+ imaging has the problem of low temporal resolution. In addition, manipulation of neural activity by conventional optogenetics through the optic fiber can only simultaneously regulate the activity of neurons with the same genetic background, making it difficult to control the activity of individual neurons. To solve this issue, we recently developed a microscope with a high spatiotemporal resolution for biological applications by combining optogenetics with digital holographic technology that can modify femtosecond infrared laser beams. Here, we describe protocols for the visualization, evaluation, and manipulation of neural activity, including the preparation of samples and operation of a two-photon holographic microscope (Figure 1). These protocols provide accurate spatiotemporal information on neural activity, which may be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders that lead to abnormalities in neural activity.

ABSTRACT:
Epitope peptides have attracted widespread attention in the field of tumor vaccines because of their safety, high specificity, and convenient production; in particular, some MHC I-restricted epitopes can induce effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity to clear tumor cells. Additionally, nasal administration is an effective and safe delivery technique for tumor vaccines due to its convenience and improved patient compliance. However, epitope peptides are unsuitable for nasal delivery because of their poor immunogenicity and lack of delivery efficiency. Nanoemulsions (NEs) are thermodynamically stable systems that can be loaded with antigens and delivered directly to the nasal mucosal surface. Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV) is the core pentapeptide of laminin, an integrin-binding peptide expressed by human respiratory epithelial cells. In this study, an intranasal self-assembled epitope peptide NE tumor vaccine containing the synthetic peptide IKVAV-OVA257-264 (I-OVA) was prepared by a low-energy emulsification method. The combination of IKVAV and OVA257-264 can enhance antigen uptake by nasal mucosal epithelial cells. Here, we establish a protocol to study the physicochemical characteristics by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS); stability in the presence of mucin protein; toxicity by examining the cell viability of BEAS-2B cells and the nasal and lung tissues of C57BL/6 mice; cellular uptake by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM); release profiles by imaging small animals in vivo; and the protective and therapeutic effect of the vaccine by using an E.G7 tumor-bearing model. We anticipate that the protocol will provide technical and theoretical clues for the future development of novel T cell epitope peptide mucosal vaccines.

ABSTRACT:
Enamel is the hardest tissue in mammalian organisms and is the layer covering the tooth. It consists of hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystallites, which mineralize on a protein scaffold known as the enamel matrix. Enamel matrix assembly is a very complex process mediated by enamel matrix proteins (EMPs). Altered HAP deposition or disintegration of the protein scaffold can cause enamel defects. Various methods have been established for enamel phenotyping, including MicroCT scanning with various resolutions from 9 µm for in vivo imaging to 1.5 µm for ex vivo imaging. With increasing resolution, we can see not only the enamel layer itself but also a detailed map of mineralization. To study enamel microstructure, we combine the MicroCT analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which enables us to perform element analyses such as calcium-carbon ratio. However, the methods mentioned above only show the result-already formed enamel. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy provides extra information about protein structure in the form of EMP localization and position before enamel mineralization. A combination of all these methods allows analyzing the same sample on multiple levels-starting with the live animal being scanned harmlessly and quickly, followed by sacrifice and high-resolution MicroCT scans requiring no special sample preparation. The biggest advantage is that samples remain in perfect condition for SEM or STED microscopic analysis. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence nanoscopy methods based on the RESOLFT principle, such as beam-scanning STED nanoscopy, require the co-alignment of optical beams for molecular state (on/off) switching and fluorescence excitation. The complexity and stability of the beam alignment can be drastically simplified and improved by using a single-mode fibre as the sole light source for all required laser beams. This in turn then requires a chromatic optical element for shaping the off-switching beam into a focal-plane donut while simultaneously leaving the focal intensity distributions at other wavelengths shaped as regular focal spots. Here we describe novel designs of such so-called 'easySTED phase plates' and provide a rationale how to find the desired spectral signature for combinations of multiple wavelengths.

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution microscopy in the form of photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) offers the possibility of counting single molecules in a cell, a cellular compartment or a molecular complex. PALM can, therefore, underpin molecular and biochemical processes with a numeric and stoichiometric understanding of the interacting players. Here, we introduce the physical principles underlying PALM and provide a step-by-step protocol of how to apply PALM to questions related to the biology and pathophysiology of P. falciparum and other malaria parasites.

ABSTRACT:
In confocal microscopy, the effective optical transfer function (OTFeff) with Gaussian plane wave illumination covers very few high-frequency components, which prohibits further improvement of the resolution. We propose modulated pattern scanning microscopy (MPSM) to achieve super-resolution imaging. In MPSM, the phase of the illumination beam is modulated to reassign the OTFeff in the Fourier domain. The phase mask is designed using an optimization algorithm to obtain the fluorescence emission pattern with rich high-frequency components. Then, the postprocessing algorithms are adapted to retrieve the super-resolved images from the modulated recordings. Simulation and experiment demonstrate that MPSM increases the resolution approximately 1.3 times better than confocal microscopy. Compared with conventional deconvolution, MPSM exhibits a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

ABSTRACT:
This novel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy-based assay facilitates the simultaneous measurement of the length of the catalytic cycle for hundreds of individual restriction endonuclease (REase) molecules in one experiment. This assay does not require protein labeling and can be carried out with a single imaging channel. In addition, the results of multiple individual experiments can be pooled to generate well-populated dwell-time distributions. Analysis of the resulting dwell-time distributions can help elucidate the DNA cleavage mechanism by revealing the presence of kinetic steps that cannot be directly observed. Example data collected using this assay with the well-studied REase, EcoRV - a dimeric Type IIP restriction endonuclease that cleaves the palindromic sequence GAT↓ATC (where ↓ is the cut site) - are in agreement with prior studies. These results suggest that there are at least three steps in the pathway to DNA cleavage that is initiated by introducing magnesium after EcoRV binds DNA in its absence, with an average rate of 0.17 s-1 for each step.

ABSTRACT:
Super Resolution (SR) microscopy has become a powerful tool to study cellular architecture at the nanometer scale. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a method in which fluorophore labels repeatedly switch On and Off ("blink"). Their exact locations are estimated by computing the centers of individual blinks. Therefore, the image quality depends on the density of the detected labels, as well as the accuracy of the estimation of their location. Both are influenced by several factors. Here we present a step-by-step method that optimizes many of these factors to facilitate multicolor imaging.

ABSTRACT:
This report described sample preparation methods that scanning and transmission electron microscope observations, demonstrated by preparing appendages of the woodboring beetle, Chlorophorus caragana Xie & Wang (2012), for both types of electron microscopy. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) sample preparation protocol was based on sample chemical fixation, dehydration in a series of ethanol baths, drying, and sputter-coating. By adding Tween 20 (Polyoxyethylene sorbitan laurate) to the fixative and the wash solution, the insect body surface of woodboring beetle was washed more cleanly in SEM. This study's transmission electron microscopy (TEM) sample preparation involved a series of steps including fixation, ethanol dehydration, embedding in resin, positioning using fluorescence microscopy, sectioning, and staining. Fixative with Tween 20 enabled penetrate the insect body wall of woodboring beetle more easily than it would had been without Tween 20, and subsequently better fixed tissues and organs in the body, thus yielded clear transmission electron microscope observations of insect sensilla ultrastructures. The next step of this preparation was determining the positions of insect sensilla in the sample embedded in the resin block by using fluorescence microscopy to increase the precision of target sensilla positioning. This improved slicing accuracy.

DOI: 10.3791/61907

ABSTRACT:
Off-axis electron holography is a powerful technique that involves the formation of an interference pattern in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) by overlapping two parts of an electron wave, one of which has passed through a region of interest on a specimen and the other is a reference wave. The resulting off-axis electron hologram can be analyzed digitally to recover the phase difference between the two parts of the electron wave, which can then be interpreted to provide quantitative information about local variations in electrostatic potential and magnetic induction within and around the specimen. Off-axis electron holograms can be recorded while a specimen is subjected to external stimuli such as elevated or reduced temperature, voltage, or light. The protocol that is presented here describes the practical steps that are required to record, analyze, and interpret off-axis electron holograms, with a primary focus on the measurement of magnetic fields within and around nanoscale materials and devices. Presented here are the steps involved in the recording, analysis, and processing of off-axis electron holograms, as well as the reconstruction and interpretation of phase images and visualization of the results. Also discussed are the need for optimization of the specimen geometry, the electron optical configuration of the microscope, and the electron hologram acquisition parameters, as well as the need for the use of information from multiple holograms to extract the desired magnetic contributions from the recorded signal. The steps are illustrated through a study of specimens of B20-type FeGe, which contain magnetic skyrmions and were prepared with focused ion beams (FIBs). Prospects for the future development of the technique are discussed.

TITLE: Advances in research of DNA damage and repair in cells exposed to various types of ionizing radiation in the era of super-resolution optical microscopy.
AUTHORS: Falk Martin, Hausmann Michael
JOURNAL: Casopis lekaru ceskych (2020)
PMID: 33445935

ABSTRACT:
The present work introduces new findings about the influence of different radiation types on the cells, with the concern on the micro- and nanodosimetric aspects of chromatin damage. Emphasized is the relationship between the physical parameters of the incident radiation (g-rays, protons and high-LET heavy ions), character of chromatin damage, ability of cells to repair and survive DNA damage, and risk of genetic changes. While confirming a positive correlation between the LET of ionizing radiation, complexity of induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and biological effectiveness (RBE) of radiation, at the same time, we show that our understanding of this relationship is only incomplete. Our discovery that various accelerated ions with similar LET can damage DNA in different ways and kill cells with unequal efficiency, could serve as an example. In addition, many aspects of DSB repair remain to be explained, for instance, how the cell activates the particular repair pathway at sites of individual DSBs, and how it depends on the radiation used and the chromatin architecture. The discussed results may be important, above all, for newly developing hadron therapy and in the context of manned interstellar flights planning. From the methodological point of view, we point to a tremendous progress in the field of optical microscopy and its research applications. In more detail, we introduce single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM).

PMID: 31710022
DOI: 10.3791/59863

ABSTRACT:
Element diffusion rates and temperature/pressure control a range of fundamental volcanic and metamorphic processes. Such processes are often recorded in lamellae exsolved from host mineral phases. Thus, the analysis of the orientation, size, morphology, composition and spacing of exsolution lamellae is an area of active research in the geosciences. The conventional study of these lamellae has been conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and more recently with focused ion beam (FIB)-based nanotomography, yet with limited chemical information. Here, we explore the use of atom probe tomography (APT) for the nanoscale analysis of ilmenite exsolution lamellae in igneous titanomagnetite from ash deposits erupted from the active Soufrière Hills Volcano (Montserrat, British West Indies). APT allows the precise calculation of interlamellar spacings (14-29 ± 2 nm) and reveals smooth diffusion profiles with no sharp phase boundaries during the exchange of Fe and Ti/O between the exsolved lamellae and the host crystal. Our results suggest that this novel approach permits nanoscale measurements of lamellae composition and interlamellar spacing that may provide a means to estimate the lava dome temperatures necessary to model extrusion rates and lava dome failure, both of which play a key role in volcanic hazard mitigation efforts.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2019)
PMID: 30735154
DOI: 10.3791/58756

ABSTRACT:
In living cells, processes such as adhesion formation involve extensive structural changes in the plasma membrane and the cell interior. In order to visualize these highly dynamic events, two complementary light microscopy techniques that allow fast imaging of live samples were combined: spinning disk microscopy (SD) for fast and high-resolution volume recording and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy for precise localization and visualization of the plasma membrane. A comprehensive and complete imaging protocol will be shown for guiding through sample preparation, microscope calibration, image formation and acquisition, resulting in multi-color SD-TIRF live imaging series with high spatio-temporal resolution. All necessary image post-processing steps to generate multi-dimensional live imaging datasets, i.e. registration and combination of the individual channels, are provided in a self-written macro for the open source software ImageJ. The imaging of fluorescent proteins during initiation and maturation of adhesion complexes, as well as the formation of the actin cytoskeletal network, was used as a proof of principle for this novel approach. The combination of high resolution 3D microscopy and TIRF provided a detailed description of these complex processes within the cellular environment and, at the same time, precise localization of the membrane-associated molecules detected with a high signal-to-background ratio.

PMID: 31355791
DOI: 10.3791/59609

ABSTRACT:
Atomic force microscopy based single cell force spectroscopy (AFM-SCFS) is a powerful tool for studying biophysical properties of living cells. This technique allows for probing interaction strengths and dynamics on a live cell membrane, including those between cells, receptor and ligands, and alongside many other variations. It also works as a mechanism to deliver a physical or biochemical stimulus on single cells in a spatiotemporally controlled manner, thus allowing specific cell activation and subsequent cellular events to be monitored in real-time when combined with live-cell fluorescence imaging. The key step in those AFM-SCFS measurements is AFM-cantilever functionalization, or in other words, attaching a subject of interest to the cantilever. Here, we present methods to modify AFM cantilevers with a single T cell and a single polystyrene bead respectively for immunological studies. The former involves a biocompatible glue that couples single T cells to the tip of a flat cantilever in a solution, while the latter relies on an epoxy glue for single bead adhesion in the air environment. Two immunological applications associated with each cantilever modification are provided as well. The methods described here can be easily adapted to different cell types and solid particles.

ABSTRACT:
This protocol describes a method for spinal cord laminectomy and glass window implantation for in vivo imaging of the mouse spinal cord. An integrated digital vaporizer is utilized to achieve a stable plane of anesthesia at a low-flow rate of isoflurane. A single vertebral spine is removed, and a commercially available cover-glass is overlaid on a thin agarose bed. A 3D-printed plastic backplate is then affixed to the adjacent vertebral spines using tissue adhesive and dental cement. A stabilization platform is used to reduce motion artifact from respiration and heartbeat. This rapid and clamp-free method is well-suited for acute multi-photon fluorescence microscopy. Representative data are included for an application of this technique to two-photon microscopy of the spinal cord vasculature in transgenic mice expressing eGFP:Claudin-5 - a tight junction protein.

TITLE: How to Quantify the Fraction of Photoactivated Fluorescent Proteins in Bulk and in Live Cells.
AUTHORS: Chen Vanessa, Renz Malte
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2019)
PMID: 30663670
DOI: 10.3791/58588

ABSTRACT:
Photoactivatable and -convertible fluorescent proteins (PA-FPs) have been used in fluorescence live-cell microscopy for analyzing the dynamics of cells and protein ensembles. Thus far, no method has been available to quantify in bulk and in live cells how many of the PA-FPs expressed are photoactivated to fluoresce. Here, we present a protocol involving internal rulers, i.e., genetically coupled spectrally distinct (photoactivatable) fluorescent proteins, to ratiometrically quantify the fraction of all PA-FPs expressed in a cell that are switched on to be fluorescent. Using this protocol, we show that different modes of photoactivation yielded different photoactivation efficiencies. Short high-power photoactivation with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) resulted in up to four times lower photoactivation efficiency than hundreds of low-level exposures applied by CLSM or a short pulse applied by widefield illumination. While the protocol has been exemplified here for (PA-)GFP and (PA-)Cherry, it can in principle be applied to any spectrally distinct photoactivatable or photoconvertible fluorescent protein pair and any experimental set-up.

TITLE: Photobleaching Enables Super-resolution Imaging of the FtsZ Ring in the Cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus.

PMID: 30474628
DOI: 10.3791/58603

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution microscopy has been widely used to study protein interactions and subcellular structures in many organisms. In photosynthetic organisms, however, the lateral resolution of super-resolution imaging is only ~100 nm. The low resolution is mainly due to the high autofluorescence background of photosynthetic cells caused by high-intensity lasers that are required for super-resolution imaging, such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Here, we describe a photobleaching-assisted STORM method which was developed recently for imaging the marine picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. After photobleaching, the autofluorescence of Prochlorococcus is effectively reduced so that STORM can be performed with a lateral resolution of ~10 nm. Using this method, we acquire the in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) organization of the FtsZ protein and characterize four different FtsZ ring morphologies during the cell cycle of Prochlorococcus. The method we describe here might be adopted for the super-resolution imaging of other photosynthetic organisms.

ABSTRACT:
The osteocytic cytoplasmic processes show regularly-arranged three-dimensional structure, a cellular network called osteocytic lacunar-canalicular system (OLCS). We have demonstrated the ultrastructure of the cellular network of OLCS by means of a structured illumination microscope method (SIM) and a Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM). We also attempted to localize exogenously-administered minodronate, a new generation of bisphosphonate, as well as calcium deposition onto the bone forming surface, using an isotope microscope system.

TITLE: [Super-resolution optical microscopy of the organ of Corti. Investigations on the fine structure of the inner hair cell afferent synapse by the 4Pi and STED techniques].

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Inner hair cells encode sound into action potentials in the auditory nerve. Spiral ganglion neurons form the afferent innervation of inner hair cells via the hair cell synapse. The structure and function of this ribbon-type synapse is considered to have a major impact on the sound encoding process itself. In this study we have used conventional confocal microscopy as well as super-resolution techniques to investigate the synaptic organization in the inner hair cells of mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Functionally relevant proteins of the afferent inner hair cell synapse were selectively marked using immunohistochemical methods and investigated with conventional confocal and super-resolution 4Pi- and stimulated emission depletion (STED) techniques. RESULTS: Synapse and innervation density was mapped over the entire tonotopic axis. We found inner hair cells in the region of best hearing to have about twice the number of afferent fibres compared to the apex or base of the cochlea. For the first time 4Pi and STED microscopic techniques were employed to resolve the fine structure of these synapses beyond the resolution of conventional light microscopy. With 4Pi a resolution of approximately 100 nm in the z-axis direction is feasible. In practice STED delivers an effective resolution between 150 and 30 nm, depending on the power of the lasers employed. Synapses at different tonotopic positions of the cochlea exhibit no relevant structural differences at this level of resolution. The 4Pi and STED microscopic techniques are capable of showing the structure of afferent synapses in the organ of Corti with unsurpassed resolution. These images contribute to our understanding of sound-encoding mechanisms in the inner ear.

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective clinical study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the novel 50 µm FFDM (full-field digital mammography) system (DR) with an established 70 µm system (DR) in the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant clusters of microcalcification (n=50) (BI-RADS™ classification 4/5) and to assess the possible incremental value of the 50 µm pixel-pitch on specificity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From March 2009 to September 2009, 50 patients underwent full-field digital mammography (FFDM) (detector resolution 70 µm) (Novation, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). As there were suspicious signs of microcalcification classified with BI-RADS™ 4/5 after diagnosis and preoperative wire localization, control images were made with the new FFDM system (detector: resolution 50 µm) (Amulet, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) with the same exposure parameters. The diagnosis was determined after the operation by five radiologists with different experience in digital mammography from randomly distributed mediolateral views (monitor reading) whose results were correlated with the final histology of all lesions. RESULTS: Histopathology revealed 19 benign and 31 malignant lesions in 50 patients after open biopsy. The results of the five readers showed a higher sensitivity of the new FFDM system (80.0%) in the ability to recognize malignant microcalcification in comparison to the established system (74.8%). The specificity (75.8 versus 71.6%) was slightly higher for the new system but these results were not statistically significant (p<0.001). Considering the diagnostic accuracy, the new system (detector: resolution 50 µm) was also slightly superior to the well-known system (detector: resolution 70 µm) (80.1% versus 76.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that the new full-field digital mammography system using the novel detector compared with the already established FFDM system with respect to the assessment of microcalcification is at least equivalent.

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: It is evident that there is a growing need for Internet-based reference databases for reasons of practicability and due to the increasing use of reporting on digital workstations. The main advantages of online databases are expected with respect to plain film radiography and cross-sectional imaging. A reference database of skeletal plain film radiography was to be created using the Orthorad program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The most important standard settings and special images of young and healthy adults in plain film radiography were collected over one year. All samples were approved for the Orthorad database by a board qualified radiologist. Based on the workflows of radiographers and radiologists, the records were organized by body part ( http://www.idr.med.uni-erlangen.de/orthorad/orthorad.htm ). This logical data structure will ensure that the tool serves as a source of information in two ways: On the one hand, the radiographer can access information on positioning, tube voltage and cassette format. On the other hand, the radiologist receives important knowledge regarding X-ray anatomy, reference data regarding the human skeleton, and information about the correct reporting for an image. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Orthorad is used as an online reference database for traumatologic plain film radiography to support radiographers and radiologists in their daily working routines. To date, user feedback has been positive.

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of microcalcifications and focal lesions in a retrospective clinical-histological study using high-resolution digital phosphor storage plates (hard copy) and full-field digital mammography (hard copy). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2003 to September 2003, 102 patients underwent digital storage plate mammography (CR), using a mammography unit (Mammomat 3000 N, Siemens) in combination with a high resolution (9 lp/mm) digital storage phosphor plate system (pixel size 50 microm) (Fuji/Siemens). After diagnosis and preoperative wire localization, full-field digital mammography (CCD) (DR) was performed with the same exposure parameters. The full-field digital mammography used a CCD-detector (SenoScan) (Fisher Imaging) with a resolution of 10 Ip/mm and a pixel size of 50 microm. Five investigators determined the diagnosis (BI-RADS I - V) retrospectively after the operation from randomly distributed mediolateral views (hard copy reading). These results were correlated with the final histology. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of digital storage plate mammography (CR) and full-field digital mammography (CCD) (DR) was 73 % and 71 % for all findings (n = 102), 73 % and 71 % for microcalcifications (n = 51), and 72 % and 70 % for focal lesions (n = 51). The overall results showed no difference. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the equivalence of high-resolution digital phosphor storage plate mammography (CR) and full-field digital mammography (CCD) (DR).

TITLE: A low-field MR system in acute traumatological imaging in radiology. Technical note.
AUTHORS: Wutke R, Fellner F A, Fellner C, Stangl R, Richter H, Franck W, Cavallaro A, Bautz W A
JOURNAL: Rontgenpraxis; Zeitschrift fur radiologische Technik (2001)
PMID: 11681080

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: In this paper initial clinical observations with the application of a new low-field MR system in acute musculoskeletal imaging in radiology are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This system is designed as a three-sided open permanent magnet with a revolving table. Main magnetic field strength is 0.2 T, maximal gradient field strength 20 mT/m, and minimal gradient rise time is 800 microseconds. First clinical experiences in 25 patients with acute trauma of peripheral joints were obtained. The following sequences were applied: gradient-echo (GRE) STIR, T1-weighted spin-echo, and PD- and T2-weighted turbo spin-echo. Correlation with the findings of high-field MR (1.5 T), plain radiograms (including stress views), CT or ultrasound was available in each patient confirming the low-field diagnoses. Furthermore, phantom measurements were performed to verify the spatial resolution of the system for some sequences with typical measurement parameters. DISCUSSION: This low-field system has several advantages: fast and economic installation, limited required space, easy operation, and high patient comfort. The medical benefit of such a system integrated in the traumatological suite of a radiological department seems to be evident due to the impact on the early initiation of the correct therapy which avoids additional diagnostic procedures and therefore may reduce costs. Implementation of such a system may be useful, if installation of an additional high-field scanner is not possible due to economic considerations.

PMID: 9764739

ABSTRACT:
Scanning a point light source in close proximity over a sample and recording the scattered or transmitted light intensity point by point allows one to record optical images with a resolution not limited by diffraction. An overview of this technique called scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM or NSOM) is given with emphasis on cell- and microbiology. After an introduction, where the basic features of the technique are explained, illustrative examples are presented, such as a HeLa cell, fluorescence labelled human chromosomes, super resolution fluorescence imaging, single molecule imaging and fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a single pair of dye molecules.

DOI: 10.3791/68154

ABSTRACT:
The cell wall is the first component of signal reception/transduction for a plant cell during development and when responding to environmental abiotic and biotic stressors. The cell constantly monitors the integrity of its cell wall and modulates it in response to stress. Elucidating the specific structural and biochemical modulations occurring in the cell wall is a difficult task especially when employing multicellular plants and their organs/tissues. This is due to limits as to what can be resolved in an individual cell that is part of a complex multicellular network. The unicellular streptophyte alga, Penium margaritaceum, has recently been used in investigations of pectin dynamics, cell wall-based phenotypic plasticity and multiple aspects of algal cell biology. Its simple phenotype, distinct cell wall that has many components notably similar to land plant cell walls, and ease in immunocytochemical and experimental studies make it a powerful model organism in plant cell wall biology. The goal of this study is to provide the basic techniques for culturing, experimental manipulation and screening of applied stressors. Screening protocols for immunocytochemistry, confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging and scanning electron microscopy imaging of cell wall structure. Likewise, many of the described techniques may be modified for a wide array of other cell and molecular studies.

ABSTRACT:
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are widely used as a vertebrate model in cardiovascular research due to their genetic similarity to humans, optical transparency during early development, and amenability to in vivo imaging. This manuscript presents a standardized, accessible protocol for assessing cardiac morphology and function in zebrafish embryos at 96 h post-fertilization (hpf) using brightfield light microscopy. The method includes embryo collection, morphological screening, immobilization in agarose, video recording of the beating heart, and image-based analysis of cardiac parameters such as ventricular dimensions, stroke volume, heart rate, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. Calculations are based on geometric approximations of the ventricle using open-source software (e.g., ImageJ, Zembryo Analyzer). The protocol enables quantitative assessment of cardiac performance using widely available equipment, making it suitable for laboratories with limited resources and high-throughput screenings. In this study, 96 hpf zebrafish larvae were analyzed by recording the beating heart under a light microscope. Key cardiac parameters measured included ventricular dimensions, which were used to calculate stroke volume and heart rate, determined by beats per minute. From these, ejection fraction and cardiac output were derived to assess overall cardiac performance. Representative results from healthy embryos demonstrated consistent ventricular contraction and robust functional indices, while embryos exposed to cadmium showed impaired cardiac morphology and significantly reduced cardiac output. Overall, the method is important for detecting developmental cardiotoxicity and provides a reproducible, non-invasive approach for evaluating cardiac function in vivo during early zebrafish development.

PMID: 41182966
DOI: 10.3791/69284

ABSTRACT:
Endocytosis of receptors and other transmembrane proteins from the cell surface to endosomes and beyond is critical for homeostasis, physiology, and function. To investigate endocytic uptake and retrograde protein trafficking, we have established a versatile toolkit comprising functionalized nanobodies to monitor transport from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by means of fixed and live-cell imaging, electron microscopy, and gel electrophoresis combined with autoradiography. We developed derivatized nanobodies targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP) or mCherry - monomeric, non-crosslinking, high-affinity protein binders - that can be added to cell lines expressing membrane proteins of interest bearing the corresponding extracellular fluorescence tags. Upon binding to GFP- or mCherry-tagged transmembrane reporters, the nanobodies are specifically internalized and trafficked in parallel with the reporters' endogenous sorting routes. These nanobodies were functionalized with selected fluorophores to track retrograde transport by fluorescence microscopy and live imaging, with ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2) to resolve ultrastructural localization by electron microscopy, and with tyrosine sulfation motifs to quantitatively assess TGN arrival kinetics. In this methodological study, we detail the general protocol for bacterial expression and purification of functionalized nanobodies, as well as the generation of stable GFP-reporter cell lines. We exemplify the utility of this approach for live-cell imaging by employing an mCherry-modified anti-GFP nanobody (VHH-mCherry) to analyze the endocytic uptake of the transferrin receptor (TfR) and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CDMPR).

PMID: 41144491
DOI: 10.3791/68847

ABSTRACT:
Accurate chromosome segregation during oocyte meiosis is essential for ensuring proper embryonic development and preventing aneuploidy-related disorders. Live-cell imaging combined with fluorescence labelling techniques have become a powerful approach for studying meiotic chromosome dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. In this protocol, we summarize key methodologies for visualizing chromosome segregation in live mouse oocytes, focusing on the use of histone H2B-RFP for chromatin labelling and SiR-Tubulin for spindle tracking. We describe the procedures for sample preparation, mRNA microinjection, oocyte culture, live-cell imaging chamber setup, and confocal microscopy settings, all optimized to achieve high-resolution imaging while minimizing phototoxicity. Furthermore, we highlight critical experimental considerations such as phototoxicity, image processing, and quantitative analysis of meiotic events. By providing a comprehensive evaluation of current methodologies, this protocol serves as a practical guide for researchers seeking to investigate chromosome dynamics in live oocytes and improve the accuracy and reproducibility of meiotic studies.

PMID: 40293947
DOI: 10.3791/67237

ABSTRACT:
Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling the study of macromolecular structures in near-native conditions, suspended in vitreous ice. This technique allows for the high-resolution visualization of proteins and other biomolecules without the need for crystallization, offering significant insights into their function and mechanism. Recent advancements in single-particle analysis, coupled with improved computational data processing, have made cryo-EM an indispensable tool in modern structural biology. Despite its growing adoption, cryo-EM faces persistent challenges that can limit its effectiveness, particularly uneven particle distribution. This issue often leads to poor resolution and reduced accuracy in reconstructed protein structures. This article outlines a simple, practical approach to address this challenge, using the small heat-shock protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjsHSP16.5) as an example. The method optimizes sample preparation to minimize preferential adsorption, ensuring more homogeneous particle distribution and higher-quality protein cryo-EM structures. This technique offers valuable guidance for researchers aiming to overcome similar challenges in structural studies.

ABSTRACT:
Accessing detailed visual information and quantitative data from microbiological samples using conventional optical microscopy is limited by the diffraction barrier. One solution to enhance resolution is Expansion Microscopy (ExM), an innovative and cost-effective super-resolution technique that physically enlarges samples by approximately four times their original size. For successful expansion, it is essential to homogenize the mechanical properties of the biological material. Biofilms are bacterial communities, adhering to a surface and embedded in an extracellular matrix they produce; they require ExM protocols to be adapted to accommodate their unique structural components. This article presents Proteus mirabilis biofilm ExM (PmbExM), a specialized variant of ExM that enables super-resolution visualization of P. mirabilis biofilms grown for 48 h. The protocol focuses on the targeted degradation of key structural components of samples through serial enzymatic digestions, optimized near their theoretical conditions. PmbExM utilizes a combination of enzymes, including α-amylase, cellulase, and lyticase glycoside-hydrolases for polysaccharide hydrolysis; mutanolysin for peptidoglycan hydrolysis; and proteinase K for protein hydrolysis. These digestion procedures are independent of the gelation process, allowing modifications to meet specific homogenization requirements in different biofilm models. This adaptability offers great potential for application across various bacterial species and growth conditions. ExM has been applied to different biofilm species with overall suboptimal expansion factors. In contrast, PmbExM achieves the theoretical maximum expansion factor of the standard acrylamide-acrylate ExM hydrogel, without significant distortion of morphology or topology. The aim of this work is to provide an accessible super-resolution protocol for visualizing the architecture, assembly, and cellular and intracellular features of P. mirabilis biofilms.

ABSTRACT:
We present multimodal confocal Raman micro-spectroscopy (RS) and tomographic phase microscopy (TPM) for quick morpho-chemical phenotyping of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Leveraging the non-perturbative nature of these advanced microscopy techniques, we captured detailed morpho-molecular data from living, label-free cells in their native physiological environment. Human bias-free data processing pipelines were developed to analyze hyperspectral Raman images (spanning Raman modes from 600 cm-1 to 1800 cm-1, which uniquely characterize a wide range of molecular bonds and subcellular structures), as well as morphological data from three-dimensional refractive index tomograms (providing measurements of cell volume, surface area, footprint, and sphericity at nanometer resolution, alongside dry mass and density). By systematically breaking down the rich single-cell details that RS and TPM deliver, we demonstrate, in a quantitative manner, the advantage of such a multimodal microscopy method for phenotyping tumoral breast cancer cells. Our tools also provide further insight into the subcellular information without the use of any labels. Finally, we study and discuss any unique or correlated information that RS- and TPM-derived datasets feature. We believe our tools and quantitative data analysis pipelines can revolutionize phenotyping tasks in biomedical research when in need of a rapid and non-perturbative method on living cells in culture, with the potential for future translation into clinical and diagnostic applications.

ABSTRACT:
Highly multiplexed imaging enables the study of functionally diverse cells and their niches within their native tissue environments. Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX) is a cyclic immunolabeling and fluorophore inactivation technique that allows for multiple markers to be visualized on the same tissue section. Captured images can be subsequently analyzed to acquire single-cell data to define cell clusters, their localizations, and neighboring cell types. Interpreting these data relies on the ability to distinguish true marker expressions from sources of background inherent to fluorescence microscopy. Spectral IBEX, an adaptation of the IBEX protocol, integrates spectral confocal detection with computational unmixing and incorporates heparin blocking to reduce charge-based off-target binding. This combination improves the signal-to-background ratio, suppresses tissue autofluorescence, and minimizes bleed-through while also reducing acquisition time compared to conventional multi-track confocal imaging. Application to human nasal polyp tissue, a model characterized by high eosinophil content and strong autofluorescence, demonstrated reliable imaging of 26 markers across structural, immune, and cell state compartments over six imaging rounds. The resulting workflow generates high-dimensional, spatially resolved proteomic information that captures complex tissue architecture and cellular niches. Together, this optimized approach provides a robust and broadly applicable strategy for multiplexed imaging, particularly suited to tissues where autofluorescence and non-specific staining limit conventional approaches.

ABSTRACT:
Recent advances in quantitative microscopy for the life sciences have enabled experimental biologists to probe cells with unprecedented resolution and speed. At the same time, the AI revolution has dramatically increased the amount of information that can be extracted from multidimensional microscopy data. However, the large amount of data generated and the complexity of state-of-the-art AI models pose a severe bottleneck at the image analysis stage. Cell-ACDC is an open-source, user-friendly software that provides a powerful end-to-end solution for segmentation, tracking, and quantitative analysis of single cells in multidimensional microscopy data. It is tailored for experimental biologists who may lack the advanced technical expertise required to implement such models. This article shows how to utilize the framework to easily leverage the most recent models, along with many tools for smart and semi-automated data correction, to maximize the amount of biological information obtainable. Cell-ACDC supports multi-channel, time-lapse, and z-stack microscopy data, and provides a dedicated toolset tailored to each type of data dimensionality. Because of its modular design, which allows new models to be seamlessly integrated and directly accessed by biologists, Cell-ACDC has the potential to serve as a reference tool for microscopy data analysis.

TITLE: An Electroporation Cytometry Protocol for Live-Cell, Fluorescence Microscopy Using U2 OS Cell Culture.

ABSTRACT:
Pulsed electric fields (PEFs) have a wide range of applications in medical research and clinical applications. A key area of research focuses on electroporation (reversible or irreversible). Reversible electroporation has been used for several decades for transferring molecules through cell membranes such as plasmid DNA, typically referred to as gene electrotransfer (GET). Conversely, irreversible electroporation has become a popular technique in cancer treatment, providing a non-toxic alternative by permanently rupturing cells using PEFs. This can be combined with various types of drugs or reagents to enhance the effect which has become known as electrochemotherapy (ECT). However, despite the broad success in practical applications, further supporting technology and research is required to improve current techniques. To address this, an electroporation cytometry system was developed to support live-cell PEF experimentation with the ability to perform long-term fluorescence microscopy. This was in combination with a stably expressing FUCCI(CA)5 U2-OS cell line for assessing changes in the cell cycle in response to PEF exposure. In doing so, up to 30 h timelapse microscopy was achieved, providing real-time changes in cell activity based on the FUCCI(CA)5 reporter. As a result, phase-specific changes were quantifiable for downstream analysis.

TITLE: Mapping Absolute DNA Density in Cell Nuclei using Single-molecule Localization Microscopy.
AUTHORS: Gélleri Márton, Strickfaden Hilmar
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 41325419
DOI: 10.3791/64268

ABSTRACT:
Within the cell nucleus, silent genes are generally located in chromatin areas of high density called heterochromatin, whereas active genes can be mostly found at the interface between chromatin and the interchromatin space called euchromatin. At present, the characterization of eu- and heterochromatin is mostly based on epigenetic modifications of histone proteins along the DNA sequence, while little is known about absolute DNA densities across the cell nucleus and their functional implications. Models of the nucleus solely based on biochemical data and assumptions about the nature of chromatin as a polymer still differ fundamentally from imaging data generated by high-resolution microscopy. This indicates that there is still important structurally relevant information missing. We believe that spatial constraints might be involved in gene regulation and have therefore developed a method that allows the measurement of absolute DNA densities in mammalian cell nuclei by transforming super-resolution localization data into true-to-scale density maps by Voronoi tessellation.

ABSTRACT:
Zebrafish larvae are a promising vertebrate model system for studying the neural mechanisms of behavior. Their translucence and relatively simple neural circuitry facilitate the use of optogenetic techniques in cellular analyses of behavior. Fluorescent indicators of in vivo neural activity, such as GCaMP6s, have been widely used to study the neural activity associated with simple behaviors in larval zebrafish. Here, we present a protocol for detecting sensory-induced activity in semi-restrained zebrafish larvae using the transgenic line Tg(elav3:GCaMP6s). In particular, we use the chemical agent allyl isothiocyanate to induce a robust, reproducible fluorescent response in a brain region at the border of the hindbrain and spinal cord. We discuss the potential uses of GCaMP6s for optical monitoring of neural activity during a range of behavioral paradigms and the limitations of this technique. Our protocol outlines an accessible approach for monitoring dynamic, behavior-related in vivo neural activity in the larval zebrafish brain.

ABSTRACT:
The dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission directly contributes to mitochondrial homeostasis, which influences numerous cellular functions in addition to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) homeostasis. Therefore, assessing mitochondrial morphology under stress conditions is essential for mechanistic research. This study describes a detailed protocol for analyzing mitochondrial morphology, encompassing the preparation of a MitoTracker solution, staining of mitochondria, optimization of imaging parameters, and detection of morphological features. MitoTrackers are commonly used, cost-effective mitochondrion-specific dyes. However, some changes in mitochondrial morphology may occur owing to inappropriate handling, which can be unperceivable and fail to reflect the true state of mitochondria. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how to analyze changes in mitochondrial morphology using MitoTrackers. The protocol utilized SH-SY5Y cells stimulated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+) to illustrate the protocol of mitochondrial morphological analysis. Compared with control cells, MPP+-stimulated cells exhibited smaller and more fragmented mitochondria, with morphological parameters indicating decreased mitochondrial footprint. These results suggest that MitoTracker staining is an effective and feasible method for mitochondrial morphological analysis that (with minor modifications) can be applied to study various conditions.

TITLE: SCAnED - An Open-source Skin Segmentation Macro for Semi-automated Cell and Nuclei Detection in Epidermal and Dermal Skin Compartments.

ABSTRACT:
The spatial distribution of immune and non-immune cells within tissues and the expression of cell-specific markers provides essential information on cell function in situ. Human skin is a highly complex organ with defined compartments comprising different cells with diverse phenotypes. By using multi-fluorescence labeling, distinct skin cell populations can be determined and further characterized. However, currently, the availability of non-commercial tools for image analysis of skin samples that allow in silico segmentation of cells specifically within the epidermis or the dermis at a single-cell resolution is limited. We provide here a step-by-step protocol for immunofluorescence staining of skin sections, confocal microscopy, and image analysis using our freely available tool SCAnED (Skin Compartment Analysis of Epidermis and Dermis). The SCAnED macro allows the precise identification and classification of cells and nuclei in both the epidermal and dermal compartments of human skin. We provide guidelines on how to determine average intensity levels of maker expression in different cells and cellular compartments, such as the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and how to quantify cells expressing varying amounts of these markers with an accompanying Python pipeline provided as a ready-to-use Jupyter notebook executed in Google Colab. This protocol will allow inexperienced users to determine cell-specific expression profiles within skin tissue and provide insights into the spatial distribution of cells within the epidermal and dermal compartments, allowing a deeper understanding of the intricate tissue structure and cell composition of human skin.

TITLE: Characterization of pH-Dependent Reversible Self-Assembly of Amyloid Beta 1-40-Coated Gold Colloids.

DOI: 10.3791/67856

ABSTRACT:
The characterization of Aβ1-40 coated over the nano-gold colloidal particle surfaces was conducted using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The observed pH-dependent shift of the SPR band of Aβ1-40-coated 20 nm gold particles was correlated with alternation of aggregation and disaggregation observed in the TEM images. A pH of ~4 induced an unfolded conformation, and a pH of ~10 induced a folded conformation of Aβ1-40 on the gold surface. This reversible aggregation process was observed by Raman imaging as the pH was gradually changed from pH 4 to pH 10. We observed a pH-dependent morphology change in Aβ1-40 on the gold surface, where clear aggregates were observed at pH 4. However, we observed very subtle differences in the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectrum between pH 4 and pH 10 conditions, with the most striking difference being spectral density in the region of 250 cm-1 and 1750 cm-1. Specifically, the mode analysis of the reversible aggregation indicated that the aggregates were formed by the unfolded conformation of Aβ1-40 which involved the benzene ring section of Tyrosine and Phenylalanine. Conversely, the disassembly of the aggregates was associated with conformational changes in protein folding of Aβ1-40 involving Histidine, Glutamine, Methionine, and Aspartic acid.

ABSTRACT:
RASopathies are genetic syndromes caused by ERK hyperactivation and resulting in multisystemic diseases that can also lead to cancer predisposition. Despite a broad genetic heterogeneity, germline gain-of-function mutations in key regulators of the RAS-MAPK pathway underlie the majority of the cases, and, thanks to advanced sequencing techniques, potentially pathogenic variants affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway continue to be identified. Functional validation of the pathogenicity of these variants, essential for accurate diagnosis, requires fast and reliable protocols, preferably in vivo. Given the scarcity of effective treatments in early childhood, such protocols, especially if scalable in cost-effective animal models, can be instrumental in offering a preclinical ground for drug repositioning/repurposing. Here we describe step-by-step the protocol for rapid generation of transient RASopathy models in zebrafish embryos and direct inspection of live disease-associated ERK activity changes occurring already during gastrulation through real-time multispectral Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging. The protocol uses a transgenic ERK reporter recently established and integrated with the hardware of commercial microscopes. We provide an example application for Noonan syndrome (NS) zebrafish models obtained by expression of the Shp2D61G. We describe a straightforward method that enables registration of ERK signal change in the NS fish model before and after pharmacological signal modulation by available low-dose MEK inhibitors. We detail how to generate, retrieve, and assess ratiometric FRET signals from multispectral acquisitions before and after treatment and how to cross-validate the results via classical immunofluorescence on whole embryos at early stages. We then describe how, via examining standard morphometric parameters, to query late changes in embryo shape, indicative of a resulting impairment of gastrulation, in the same embryos whose ERK activity is assessed by live FRET at 6 h post fertilization.

ABSTRACT:
Cryo-electron tomography is a powerful tool to visualize heterogeneous samples, with one major application being structural characterization of pleomorphic viruses. In recent years, subtomogram averaging of viral glycoproteins has emerged as a method to directly visualize these crucial proteins on the surface of intact virions. One important target is the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein of influenza virus, which densely covers the viral envelope and is responsible for influenza receptor binding and membrane fusion. While subtomogram averages of influenza HA have been reported, their resolutions have been limited due to the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent to cryoET as well as the manual effort required to analyze heterogenous influenza virions. Presented here is a cryoET analysis pipeline that integrates several software packages to analyze tomographic data of influenza virions efficiently and robustly. This protocol describes the structural determination of HA from influenza virions, through steps from initial motion correction to final model building. Following this pipeline, a HA reconstruction at 6.0 Å resolution was obtained from two cryoET datasets collected from the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) influenza strain.

DOI: 10.3791/67263

ABSTRACT:
The rigid-body rotation of the three-helical middle domain (3HB) relative to the GTPase domain of dynamin-like protein atlastin (ATL) is a crucial driver of homotypic membrane fusion within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Disruptions in this process have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disorder. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the conformational changes in ATL are linked to GTP hydrolysis, but real-time visualization of these conformational dynamics during the GTP hydrolysis cycle remains challenging. To better understand the mechanical mechanisms behind ATL function, single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) was utilized. Three specific strategies were employed to immobilize the N-terminal cytosolic region of human ATL1 (ATL1cyto) in a streptavidin-coated microfluidic chamber, facilitating the application of intramolecular and intermolecular smFRET imaging. This allowed precise monitoring of protein conformations in various nucleotide-loading states, providing direct insights into individual molecular behaviors. This method can be applied to study other mechanochemical proteins as well.

TITLE: Microfabrication of Substrates with Microscale Stiffness Gradients to Guide Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Migration.

ABSTRACT:
Understanding how cells respond to mechanical signals is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms involved in tissue development and disease progression. However, existing in vitro cell culture substrates often fail to replicate the physiological stiffness gradients at the cellular scale while also eliminating confounding topographical cues. In this study, we present a decoupled stiffness model utilizing a bilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. This substrate consists of a soft, flat top film suspended over a rigid underlayer featuring ridge-and-groove microstructures. The top layer effectively transmits stiffness variations in the underlying structure while maintaining uniform topography and chemistry at the cell contact surface. Stiffness modulation is achieved by varying the width of the alternating ridges and grooves, which are spaced equally. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the flat surface morphology and consistent contact topography. Atomic force microscopy demonstrated that stiffness variations were dependent on the microstructure: for 20 μm patterns, the elastic moduli were approximately 950 kPa for ridges and 850 kPa for grooves; for 50 μm patterns, these values were around 1070 kPa and 950 kPa, respectively. Mouse primary bone marrow cells adhered well and spread on the substrate, showing a preference for nuclear localization toward the stiffer ridge regions in the 50 µm pattern (61.49%, p < 0.05), thereby confirming effective cellular perception of the mechanical gradient. In summary, this protocol offers a reproducible method to construct a cell culture substrate with microscale stiffness gradients, minimizing the chemical or topography interference, enabling investigations into cell mechanotransduction.

PMID: 40228047

ABSTRACT:
The secretion of extracellular vesicles by cestodes is crucial for enabling cellular communication not only among parasites but also with host tissues. In particular, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) act as nano-carriers transferring natural antigens, which are critical in host immunomodulation and parasite survival. This article presents a step-by-step protocol to isolate sEVs from larval stage cultures of Echinococcus granulosus and analyzes their uptake by dendritic cells obtained from murine bone marrow, which acquire adhesion and antigen presentation capacity during their maturation after one week of in vitro culture. This article provides comprehensive information for generating, purifying, and quantifying sEVs using ultracentrifugation alongside parallel analyses of dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, a detailed experimental protocol is outlined for isolating and cultivating mouse bone marrow cells and driving their differentiation into dendritic cells using Flt3L. These dendritic cells can present antigens to naïve T cells, thereby modulating the type of immune response in vivo. Thus, alternative protocols, including confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, are proposed to check the acquired maturational phenotype of dendritic cells previously exposed to parasitic sEVs. Finally, it is worth noting that the described protocol can be applied as a whole or in individual parts to carry out parasite in vitro culture, isolate extracellular vesicles, generate bone marrow-derived dendritic cell cultures, and perform uptake assays with these cells.

ABSTRACT:
In the context of biomaterials and drug testing in animal models, this study presents a streamlined protocol for fabricating a novel implantable integrated imaging window. The micro-device comprises a sophisticated system of microlenses coupled with micro-scaffolds specifically designed for in vivo quantification of the immune response using advanced non-linear excitation microscopy. The protocol is based on two-photon polymerization (2PP) of the biocompatible photoresist SZ2080, which enables the fabrication of micro-scaffolds and micro-lenses in a continuous sequence to enhance manufacturing efficiency and precision. To further improve speed, accuracy, and structural integrity, a hybrid optics fabrication approach was implemented, involving the 2PP of the microlens outer shell followed by UV bulk crosslinking of the inner core. This innovative technique optimizes the optical properties of the microlenses while streamlining the production process. The resulting micro-device demonstrates high reproducibility and mechanical stability, making it an effective method for prototyping microscale optical systems for a range of biomedical applications.

ABSTRACT:
The role of glia in glaucoma is an increasingly prominent research topic, but much remains unknown about how populations of these support cells - namely astrocytes and microglia - influence retinal ganglion cell survival. While in vivo and in vitro models provide a degree of insight, both approaches have significant limitations, such as the impact of peripheral immune response in the former and changes to physiological function induced by cell isolation and culture in the case of the latter. To minimize these confounding factors, we have developed an ex vivo retinal explant system in which astrocytes, microglia, and other retinal cell types can be maintained in situ for periods of at least 3 days, enabling targeted investigation at a higher throughput than is typically feasible with in vivo models. Crucially, this approach is highly amenable to methodologies that would be challenging or unfeasible in a living animal yet remains compatible with common downstream assays of intact nervous tissue. Here, we present a protocol suitable for the isolation and culturing of intact retinal explants, along with representative results of immunofluorescence microscopy documenting the changes undergone by glia and retinal ganglion cells in the ex vivo retina.

ABSTRACT:
Cell behavior and cell fate are impacted by electric currents or fields that are endogenous or externally applied. Static electric signals can be applied in customized microfluidic devices to mimic the electric environment in slow physiological processes such as development, wound healing, and homeostasis. An important class of cellular electric studies is the control of cell migration by static in-plane galvanic currents in simple microfluidic channels mimicking wound currents, with current densities of ~0.1-1000 A/m2. However, due to incompatible geometry, these devices are not appropriate to study electric effects in tissue homeostasis, where cells adopt apico-basal polarity and a transepithelial potential difference (TEPD). Here, we detail a unique microfluidic-based device that applies physiological ion currents perpendicular to the plane of confluent epithelial cell layers to perturb the TEPD and investigate electrical regulation of tissue steady states. The setup is made from a two-layer UV-curable polymer embedded with soft, polyacrylamide gel substrate coated with extracellular-matrix protein of choice. This microfluidic device provides the correct geometry and permeable substrate to induce a relatively uniform ion current across the cell layers of centimetric-scale. The setup is compatible with confocal live-cell imaging and Traction Force Microscopy to infer mechanical stresses induced by the transepithelial currents. Strikingly, the proliferation, extrusion and migration of cells are collectively influenced within the confluent epithelium depending on the direction of ion current, inducing a new tissue state characterized by different cell-cell interaction strengths, cell events (death and proliferation), and tissue structures. The electrically controlled cell behaviors can be understood as an electrically induced mechanical stress and cell response. This novel microfluidic device and protocol provide the tool and documentation required for the mechanobiology and bioengineering communities to study electric effects in tissue homeostasis and develop novel tissue engineering applications.

ABSTRACT:
Microbial single-cell analysis using microfluidics coupled with time-lapse microscopy holds promise for investigating microbial growth behavior under confined environments with spatiotemporal resolution, offering insights that cannot be gained from conventional cultivation and analytical platforms. Oxygen plays a crucial role in determining microbial growth. However, temporal control in the range of seconds has not been implemented in microbial analysis using microfluidics. We have recently developed a double-layer PDMS microfluidic chip enabling temporal oxygen control in the tens-of-seconds range. The chip comprises an upper layer for gassing and a bottom layer for cultivation and fluid perfusion. The two layers are separated by a thin intermediate PDMS membrane, allowing fast gas exchange between the two layers. In this methodological paper, we explain the procedure for chip fabrication, characterization, and microbial cultivation using the chip. As representative results, we demonstrate the fast oxygen switching capability in tens of seconds, microbial cultivation, and time-resolved growth analysis under constant and oscillating oxygen conditions. This protocol aims to assist researchers interested in implementing temporal oxygen control in their microfluidic setup.

ABSTRACT:
Optical microscopy encompasses a wide array of instruments and applications, each designed with the goal of obtaining the best possible image. However, achieving that goal depends on multiple factors, including, but not limited to, choice of microscope sample and calibration standards. Alignment or calibration standards are mandatory to obtain the best image possible. Currently, standards on the market are limited by such factors as fluorescence, sample volume and sample-to-sample interaction, and aberrations. Reported here is the testing of pollen as an imaging phantom, a designed material or device that mimics human tissue for the purpose of reliable and accurate calibration of an imaging system, and the benchmarking of a recently built multimodal adaptive optics multiphoton fluorescence microscope system. The developed imaging phantom was used to compare intensity values to those of an industry standard (TetraSpeck™). Comparisons were made using deconvolutions of the captured images and their resultant point-spread functions in addition to measurements taken of surface characteristics. All comparisons between imaging media, imaging conditions per photomultiplier tube (PMT), and the interaction of media and imaging conditions showed significant p-values. Results showed that medium selection had a substantial impact on intensity output and was thus influenced by the choice of PMT (signal output from a sample). Results showed the sample itself impacted the intensity readings, as indicated by the comparison of two-dimensional (TetraSpeck™) and three-dimensional (pollen grains) samples. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Angiogenesis is crucial in tissue repair, wound healing, and embryo development. Maintaining a balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is crucial for tissue homeostasis, thereby preventing the development of pathological conditions. In addition, the tissue microenvironment constantly influences molecular signaling, potentially altering this delicate balance. The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay has emerged as a dynamic, cost-effective, and ethically favorable alternative for studying angiogenesis. This work presents a detailed and accessible approach to the CAM assay, focusing on the evaluation of the angiogenic potential of applied stimuli (such as conditioned media, extracellular vesicles, or bioscaffolds) through various techniques, including hematoxylin and eosin, PicroSirius Red, Alcian Blue, and resorcin-fuchsin staining; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our protocol uses the in ovo CAM assay approach, utilizing a simple incubator setup that eliminates the need for expensive equipment. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive methodology for researchers to efficiently analyze angiogenesis, offering insights into vessel morphology and protein expression. The experiment comprises three major steps: (1) egg opening, stimulation, and sample collection; (2) histological processing and paraffin blocking; and (3) microscopic analyses. The first and second procedures take approximately 15 days, after which each analysis can be conducted whenever the researcher judges appropriate. The expected results include several types of data concerning the proliferation rate, vessel presence and integrity, measurement of angiogenic-specific proteins, and investigation of structural proteins. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative Label-Free Imaging Phase and Polarization (QLIPP) technology enables non-invasive analysis and characterization of samples based on their intrinsic properties, without the need for exogenous labeling or contrast agents. However, QLIPP often involves dealing with complex tissue structures, such as overlapping or interconnected regions, making it challenging to accurately depict such intricate architectures. In order to elucidate the inherent ordered structures across spatial and temporal scales in living systems, we propose an efficient architecture based on the Swin Transformer Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (ST-cGAN). This model synergistically combines polarized light microscopy and the cooperative reconstruction of complementary optical properties. Leveraging complementary contrast information, the ST-cGAN achieves high-precision predictions of specific structures, addressing the difficulty of QLIPP in portraying complex tissue structures accurately. We demonstrate the efficacy of the model by predicting ordered structures within different components of kidney tissue morphology, including F-actin and cell nuclei. To enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of our proposed method, the open-source code used for neural network training is available on GitHub. This work marks a significant advancement in the field of label-free live cell imaging, particularly in the identification of ordered structures, contributing to a deeper understanding of dynamic biological processes.

ABSTRACT:
The red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) and far-red fluorescent proteins (far-RFPs) that are encoded genetically can emit fluorescence within the spectral ranges of 580-680 nm when exposed to the light of appropriate wavelengths. Unlike many RFPs derived from coral species, numerous far-RFPs are optimized synthetic constructs engineered from different orange or red-emitting progenitors. Various categories have been established for the available RFPs and far-red fluorescent proteins based on their photo-chemical profile, fluorescence mechanism, and switching kinetics. Fluorescent probes (FPs) derived from these classes are extensively utilized for labelling and visualizing in vivo and in vitro specimens. Traditional optical microscopy methods generate diffraction-limited, indistinct images owing to the restricted resolution capability of light ranging from 200 to 300 nm. Since 2005, super-resolution microscopy has been a topic of great interest due to its ability to achieve imaging at spatial resolutions of less than 100 nm. The 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, Stefan Hell, and William E. Moerner for their contributions to demonstrating the effectiveness of genetically encodable fluorescent proteins in visualizing biological systems through super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. This review provides a concise overview of RFPs and far-RFPs, including the involvement of surrounding residues in chromophore intactness, stability, autocatalytic maturation and switching kinetics. All the chemical pathways proposed for photoactivation, photoconversion and photoswitching mechanisms are concisely reviewed. Subsequently, a comprehensive summary was provided regarding the various types of super-resolution techniques that are commonly employed, elucidating their underlying principles of operation, as well as the potential future applications of RFPs/far-RFPs in the field of biological imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) achieves resolution beyond the diffraction limit by employing a donut-shaped depletion laser that selectively reduces fluorescence at the periphery of the excitation area. The imaging quality of STED microscopy is closely tied to minimizing the intermediate light from the ring-depletion laser. In this study, we introduce a method termed "digital redepleted STED," which uses frequency domain filtering to generate an optimal donut profile by subtracting the "perfect donut" signal from the original STED data. This approach effectively reduces background noise and enhances the STED resolution. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that digitally redepleted STED doubled the resolution. This method is compatible with a wide range of biological samples and can be adapted for two-organelle-structure STED and 3D STED applications. We compare the performance of digitally redepleted STED with that of digitally enhanced STED (De STED) and deconvolution methods (STED Decon) in terms of the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and resolution as evaluation metrics, and we find that our method doubled the resolution and SBR for different samples compared with origin STED. Our results indicate that digitally redepleted STED outperforms both De STED and STED Decon for complicated sample like mitochondria. We anticipate that the digitally redepleted STED will have broad applicability due to its enhanced resolution, improved SBR, and ease of implementation.

TITLE: Altered APP trafficking drives amyloidogenic processing in primary neurons from the AppNL-F knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

ABSTRACT:
Self-assembly of the 42-residue long amyloid β-peptide (Aβ42) into neurotoxic aggregates - eventually leading to formation of amyloid plaques - is a key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Still, the intracellular mechanisms leading to Aβ42 formation and aggregation in neurons are poorly defined. Here, we used the AppNL-F knock-in mouse model to analyze the effect of Aβ42-induced pathology on the subcellular location of the Aβ precursor protein (APP), its C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and Aβ42 in primary neurons. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy was used to obtain super-resolution and enable colocalization analysis. APP/CTF levels were to a high extent found in clathrin-coated vesicles in the perinuclear region in soma in both wild-type and AppNL-F neurons and significantly increased in early endosomes in neurites. In distal axons, increased colocalization of APP/CTF with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin was observed. Western blotting showed a three-fold decrease in mature/immature APP in AppNL-F neurons, and ELISA showed a 2.7 and 7.2-fold increase in intra- and extracellular Aβ42 levels, respectively. Interestingly, LAMP1-positive vesicles were larger in AppNL-F neurons than in wild-type neurons. Thus, processing of APP and axonal transport of APP/CTFs is increased in AppNL-F neurons, resulting in enhanced levels of the immediate Aβ precursor (CTFβ) at the presynapse. Hence, an increase in CTFβ levels at sites with high γ-secretase activity leads to increased formation and secretion of Aβ42. This, in turn, results in enhanced re-uptake of Aβ42 and enlarged Aβ42-containing late endosomes/lysosomes in soma, causing toxic downstream effects.

TITLE: The role of PKC subtype-specific signaling in the regulation of adhesion in human keratinocytes and skin in pemphigus.

ABSTRACT:
AIM: Autoantibodies, in the blistering skin disease pemphigus primarily target desmosomal cadherins and cause loss of keratinocyte adhesion and epidermal blistering via signaling events. Pemphigus vulgaris is associated with autoantibodies (PV-IgG) against desmoglein (Dsg)1 and Dsg3 and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) with antibodies against Dsg1 only. In previous studies, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition was protective in murine but not in human epidermis. Here, we investigated the roles of PKC subtypes for pemphigus pathogenesis. METHODS: We applied the ex vivo human skin organ culture model, dispase-based dissociation assays, Western blot analysis, confocal and simulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to study underlying mechanisms in vitro. RESULTS: First, we investigated the role of PKC subtypes for PV-IgG-induced epidermal blistering in human skin. Surprisingly, the inhibitor of atypical PKC isoforms (aPKC) CRT0066854 (CRT) completely abolished acantholysis whereas the conventional PKC (cPKC) inhibitor Gö6976 (Gö) did not. In cultured keratinocytes, both CRT and Gö were effective to inhibit loss of cell adhesion, keratin filament retraction and Dsg3 depletion in response to PV-IgG as well the pathogenic Dsg3-specific IgGs AK23 and 2G4. In contrast, reduced cell adhesion and keratin filament retraction in response to PKC activation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and PF-IgG was blocked by inhibition of cPKC but not of aPKC. Mechanistically, both cPKC and aPKC were required for PV-IgG-induced translocation of PKC towards peripheral keratin filaments and conformational changes in Dp. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that aPKC is critical for blistering in human epidermis in PV dependent on the autoantibody profile.

TITLE: On the microstructural anisotropy and mechanical properties of bacterial nanocellulose obtained by static culture.

ABSTRACT:
The microstructural organization of bacterial nanocellulose is still not completely understood. Although its morphological and mechanical anisotropy is commonly recognized, it remains unclear whether the forces stabilizing the cellulose fiber network are comparable in different planes. In this study, we characterized the microstructure of statically produced BNC according to its horizontal and vertical planes. The tensile mechanical response in both planes was also investigated and complemented by finite element modeling. The intrinsic 3D anisotropy of BNC microstructure, obtained by static culture, was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, even without a stratified layered microstructure. A mechanism based on swelling-induced stretching of BNC in the vertical direction is suggested to explain the observed fiber reorganization during membrane growth: high morphological anisotropy of the fibers in the upper surface partially dissipates towards depth. Moreover, the distinct tensile mechanical response observed for both planes (Young's modulus: 1.9 MPa horizontal and 0.9 MPa vertical) supports the 3D anisotropy of static cultured BNC. However, the similar maximum tensile strength (0.39-0.41 MPa) suggests that fiber networking and cohesion are similar in orthogonal orientations. The similar cross-linking density in both planes (5.8-6 × 108 counts/mm3) determined by stimulated emission depletion microscopy suggests the same conclusion.

ABSTRACT:
Glycosylation is a crucial biochemical modification of proteins and other biomolecules in cells that generates an exceptional structural and functional diversity. Aberrant glycosylation is implicated in numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. While glycan organization at the cell surface is studied extensively, the nanoscale spatial arrangement of glycans inside cells and within organelles remains largely unexplored. Here, super-resolution imaging with fluorophore-labeled lectins, combined with a dedicated multiplexing strategy (Glyco-STORM), was used in thin neuronal tissue sections and permeabilized cells to systematically map glycosylation across multiple organelles and cellular compartments. Lectin markers were identified that enabled the visualization of nanodomains within the endoplasmic reticulum, subdomains along the Golgi axes, diverse glycosylation states in the endolysosomal system, and a polarized lysosomal clathrin coat. At neuronal synapses, mature glycans were found to demarcate the synaptic cleft and subsynaptic tubules adjacent to the postsynaptic density. In summary, Glyco-STORM establishes one of the first comprehensive nanoscale maps of intracellular glycosylation and provides entry points into health- and disease-related studies.

ABSTRACT:
ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Saussurea graminea Dunn (SG), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb known as "Za Chi" in Tibet of China, is frequently utilized in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as hepatitis. However, the active ingredients and mechanism of its therapeutic effect on Sepsis - associated liver injury (SALI) remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the effect of SG in combating SALI, uncover its mechanism of action, and explore possible active compounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a SALI model by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide to assess the efficacy of SG. Transcriptomics and metabolomics were employed to reveal its possible mechanism of action. Subsequently, Western blot, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, quantitative PCR, HPLC-MS, and molecular docking were utilized to verify its mechanism and active ingredients. RESULTS: SG effectively counteracts SALI by inhibiting the cytokine storm. Transcriptomics indicates that SG regulates SALI through mitochondrial/TNF and metabolic pathways. Metabolomics demonstrates that arachidonic acid metabolism is involved in the process of SG treating SALI. HPLC-MS identified the main components of SG as chlorogenic acid, syringin, scopoletin, rutin, isochlorogenic acid, and narcissin, and these six compounds were confirmed as potential active components in the RAW264.7 inflammation model. CONCLUSION: SG and its active ingredients play a role in alleviating SALI by reducing the cytokine storm through mtDNA/TNF/arachidonic acid metabolism.

ABSTRACT:
This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of the Coptidis Rhizoma-Scutellariae Radix on cytokine storm secondary lung injury(CSSLI) induced by CpG1826 in mice, and to elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms by which its major active components, i.e., coptisine and wogonin, alleviate CSSLI by inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore(mPTP)/nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3(NLRP3) inflammasome pyroptosis pathway. In vivo, a mouse model of CSSLI was established by CpG1826 induction. Pulmonary edema was assessed by lung wet-to-dry weight ratio(W/D), lung injury was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining, and ultrastructural changes in lung tissue were observed by transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The levels of interleukin(IL)-1β, high mobility group box 1 protein(HMGB1), IL-18, and IL-1α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). The results showed that the decoction of the Coptidis Rhizoma-Scutellariae Radix significantly reduced pulmonary edema, alleviated lung injury, and decreased the concentrations of related cytokines in BALF more effectively than either single herb alone, thereby improving CSSLI. In vitro, a CpG1826-induced CSSLI model was established in mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S cells. Calcein-AM quenching was used to screen for the most effective monomer components from the herb pair in inhibiting mPTP opening. Coptisine(5, 10, 20 μmol·L~(-1)) and wogonin(10, 20, 40 μmol·L~(-1)) markedly inhibited mPTP opening, with optimal effects and a clear dose-dependent pattern. These components suppressed mPTP opening, thereby reducing the release of mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species(ROS), effectively reversing the CpG1826-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential(MMP). Further studies revealed that both coptisine and wogonin inhibited pyroptosis and downregulated the expression of key proteins in the NLRP3/Caspase-1/gasdermin D(GSDMD) pathway. In conclusion, the Coptidis Rhizoma-Scutellariae Radix improves CpG1826-induced CSSLI in mice, and this effect is associated with the inhibition of the mPTP/NLRP3 pyroptosis pathway, providing scientific evidence for its clinical application and further development.

TITLE: Abundance, Characteristics and Risk Assessment of Microplastics in Echinoderms along the Western Cape coastline, South Africa.

ABSTRACT:
Microplastics (MPs) are prevalent in coastal environments of South Africa but there is a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and risks of MPs in coastal invertebrates. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics and ecological risks of MPs ingested by various echinoderm feeding groups. Sampling was conducted during low tide in the summer of 2020 at 14 rocky shores in the Western Cape of South Africa. By sampling various echinoderm feeding types, the abundance and characteristics of MPs (shape, colour, size by using microscopy and polymer type by using a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR)) were measured. Potential ecological risks posed by MPs were assessed using hazards of respective polymer types. Mean abundance of MPs from all echinoderms was 9.32 (± 0.76 Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)) MPs/Individual, or based on weight, 1.11 (± 0.09 MPs/g soft tissue wet weight). The abundance of MPs was highest in echinoderms sampled from Kalk Bay (56.41 ± 4.37 MPs/I), with storm water outfall pipes and human activities identified as primary source of MP contamination. Filter-feeding sea cucumbers had the highest MP abundance (21.06 ± 3.03 MPs/I), suggesting that non-selective feeding echinoderms have higher MP uptake rates than other feeding strategy echinoderms. The MPs in echinoderms were mainly black/grey (45%) polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (50%) fibres (93%) that ranged from 1000 to 2000 μm (35%) in size. The potential ecological risk of MPs was highest at Kalk Bay (site 9) due to the prevalence low abundances of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This is the first study on MPs in coastal echinoderms of the Western Cape in South Africa and provides a baseline for MPs in echinoderms. The findings are significant because they offer the first indication that MP abundance may differ between echinoderm feeding groups.

ABSTRACT:
This study investigates the impact of five widely used food-grade oils (canola, soybean, olive, palm, and coconut) with different fatty acid composition, degree of saturation, and polarity on the structural and functional performance of zein-based oleogels (ZGs) in a 3D-printed meat analogue. ZGs were characterized using confocal microscopy, colorimetry, oil and solvent holding capacity, rheology, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A dual-extrusion 3D printer was used to create model analogues using ZGs. Results indicated that different oil types impacted the color, solvent-holding capacity, rheological behavior, freeze-thaw stability, and secondary structures for ZGs, with unsaturated oils strengthening 3D printing capabilities. ZGs formulated with saturated oils (palm and coconut) exhibited higher crystallization temperatures, was brighter (higher L values), and had more yellow pigments. ZGs formulated with palm oil demonstrated large aggregation behavior via confocal microscopy and heightened G' during temperature and frequency sweeps, which correlated with its significantly lower solvent holding capacity (67.97 ± 1.66) compared to its counterparts. FTIR revealed subtle shifts in protein secondary structures, with PO exhibiting significantly higher alpha helix content (40.1 %) compared to CNO (32.8 %) and SO (34.1 %). These effects are likely attributed to differences in degrees of unsaturation, which influence interfacial interactions between the zein molecules, oil nuclei, and solvent. As this is the first study to apply ZGs as structured fat mimetics in 3D-printed meat analogues, such findings enhance our understanding of ZG structure-function relationships, thus advancing their applications in bioprinted foods.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate indicators of care and symbolism in a mid-19th-century child burial. MATERIALS: Mummified human remains, a medical bandage, remnants of plants and clothing. METHODS: Dental radiography, scanning electron microscopy, botanical identification, clothing description, a review of funerary iconography. RESULTS: A dental age between 5.5 and 6.5 years and a female sex were estimated. The bandage on the left arm contained a metal plate composed of copper and zinc, and an ivy leaf (genus Hedera). A palm branch (Phoenix dactylifera) was placed in the coffin, and the corpse was dressed in blue clothing. CONCLUSIONS: The bandage combines traditional knowledge (Hedera leaf) and contemporaneous recommendations from medical texts (metal plate) and represents a case of care of a child in mid-19th-century Madrid. The blue clothing and braided palm branch represent a Christian codified mourning for her death. SIGNIFICANCE: Evaluating funerary objects alongside skeletal remains has provided insight into ways in which traditional medical treatment, alongside current religious symbolism was intertwined to provide care and to mourn for a 19th-century child. LIMITATIONS: Preservation concerns and time constraints due to reburial precluded a complete study of the remains, and the type of ivy leaf (fertile) limits identification at the species level. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: A review of plant use in the funerary and paleopathological record during the Early Modern Period.

ABSTRACT:
Olive oil mill wastewater (OMW) is a by-product of the olive oil extraction process that causes serious environmental problems. This is due to the high concentrations of organic compounds (COD) and other toxic elements present in OMW. The rapid growth of the olive oil industry has necessitated its treatment very much needed. In this investigation, an agricultural waste material-date palm trunk fiber (DPTF)-was used as a low-cost adsorbent to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD), K+, and Cu+2 from real OMW by considering the influence of contact time, pH, and adsorbent amount. FTIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses of DPTF before and after adsorption were performed to understand the mechanism of adsorption. The results suggest that the adsorption of COD and Cu+2 reached equilibrium after 7 h, whereas that of K ions reached equilibrium within 6 h. The variation in the pH of the OMW solution showed that adsorption was more favorable under near-neutral conditions. The kinetic study indicated that the adsorption onto DPTF followed a pseudo-second-order reaction. In addition, the results of the thermodynamic study revealed that adsorption was spontaneous, and there was a decrease in the order of the OMW/DPTF interface during the adsorption process.

ABSTRACT:
Recently, the volume and growth of industrial as well as agricultural waste have caused environmental pollution. However, this issue can be mitigated through recycling and reutilization of such waste products. Therefore, this paper evaluated the potential of palm oil fuel ash (POFA), garnet waste, and sawdust as sustainable modified asphalt binders and mixtures as a substitute strategy to encourage waste recycling in road pavement construction. POFA, garnet waste, and sawdust were blended individually with asphalt grade 60/70 with varied amounts of 0% (control), 3%, 6%, and 9%. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to analyze the microstructures of raw waste materials. The physical characteristics with regard to the modified asphalt binder were determined by employing softening point, penetration, and viscosity tests. Consequently, the modified asphalt mixture was assessed using the Marshall stability test. Specifically, adding 6% POFA, 3% garnet waste, and 3% sawdust performs best in stability as a modified asphalt mixture. The correlation of stability, flow, bulk density, and stiffness for POFA-, garnet waste-, and sawdust-modified asphalt mixture was significant, with a strong coefficient of determination (R2) for all Marshall stability parameters. The statistical analysis, including one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test, revealed that the percentage levels of 0%, 3%, and 6% exhibited significant differences in stability and stiffness, highlighting the optimal modification levels for enhanced mechanical performance. These findings highlight the potential of POFA, garnet, and sawdust as effective alternative additives as asphalt modifiers, contributing to sustainable road construction by promoting the use of industrial and agricultural waste materials, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing pavement performance.

ABSTRACT:
Agricultural residues offer sustainable feedstock for biohydrogen production, but conventional processes face challenges including enzyme inhibition, poor cell retention, and limited catalyst reusability. This study compared separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) versus simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) while developing a dual-matrix entrapment (ENT) system combining sodium-alginate with activated carbon. Using Napier grass (NG) and oil palm frond (10-50 g-volatile solid (VS)/L) without pretreatment, SHF outperformed SSF by 1.5-4.8 times across all conditions. Maximum hydrogen yield (HY) (119.9 ± 10.5 mL-H2/g-VS) was achieved with the dual-matrix ENT system using NG at 10 g-VS/L. Scanning electron microscopy revealed hierarchical porous structures that enhanced enzyme diffusion and protected microbial cells. The dual-matrix ENT system maintained significantly higher cell concentrations and enzyme activity (r = 0.949 correlation with HY) through four reuse cycles, retaining 83.8 % of initial performance compared to 55.6 % for encapsulation (ENC) and 33.3 % for free cells. This approach creates ideal microenvironments for cellulolytic consortia while avoiding sugar inhibition, offering a practical solution for sustainable bioenergy production without energy-intensive pretreatment.

ABSTRACT:
Cellulose nanocellulose (CNPs) is a virtual inexhaustible source of feedstock meeting the increasing demand for green, biocompatible products and ideal candidates for nanocomposites preparation for various application such as in packaging, biomedical devices, electronics, water treatment, energy storage devices and also in electronics application. However, integration of CNPs based nanocomposite into nanofluid application has received little attention which presents a clear research gap. As a result, this study used a bio-based functionalized sodium carboxymethyl nanocellulose (ACNPs) synthesis from oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) as a template, to synthesize hybrid nanocomposites with metal oxide (MONPs) at varying ACNP-to-MONP weight ratio. The present of COO- groups on the ACNPs act as template for coordinating metal precursors, promoting uniform MONP growth and strong interaction with ACNPs. Characterization techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) confirm the successful formation of MONPs on ACNPs by examine the morphology, distribution, chemical states, and bonding environments of the MONPs on the ACNPs. Besides this, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and zeta potential characterization are also conducted to assess the thermal and colloidal stability of the produced hybrid nanocomposites. Based on the result, hybrid nanocomposite with 1:1 weight ratio of ACNPs to MONPs was selected as an optimized weight ratio. In order to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the produced hybrid nanocomposite in nanofluid, thermal conductivity test was conducted using KD2Probe. The result indicating that the utilization of ACNPs as template for nanocomposite synthesis leads to a significant optimum enhancement in the thermal conductivity at temperature 45 °C, improving it by approximately 129, 100, 80 and 56 % after adding ACNPs/Al2O3, ACNPs/ZnO, ACNPs TiO2 and ACNPs/MgO based hybrid nanocomposite which making it a promising candidate for water based-heat transfer application.

ABSTRACT:
The investigations of real industrial wastewater, such as palm oil mill effluent (POME), as a recalcitrant pollutant remain a subject of global water pollution concern. Thus, this work introduced the preparation and modification of g-C3N4 and WO3 at optimum calcination temperature, where they were used as potent visible light-driven photocatalysts in the degradation of POME under visible light irradiation. Herein, g-C3N4-derived melamine and WO3 photocatalyst were obtained at different calcination temperatures in order to tune their light absorption ability and optoelectronics properties. Both photocatalysts were proven to have their distinct phases, crystallinity levels, and elements with increasing temperature, as demonstrated by the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. Significantly, g-C3N4 (580 °C) and WO3 (450 °C) unitary photocatalysts exhibited the highest removal efficiency of POME without dilution due to good crystallinity, extended light absorption, high separation, and less recombination efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, surprisingly, the superior energy storage photocatalytic performance with outstanding stability by WO3 achieved an approximately 10% increment during darkness, compared with g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. Moreover, it has been proven that the WO3 and g-C3N4 photocatalysts are desirable photocatalysts for various pollutant degradations, with excellent visible-light utilization and favorable energy storage application.

ABSTRACT:
The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana OR500626 plays a pivotal role as a biological control agent for various agricultural pests, including the two-spotted red spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. In the current study, we tested the ability of a promising strain of the fungus isolated from the tissues of the red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus in the eastern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. B. bassiana virulence was estimated based on LC50 values calculated by Probit analysis of T. urticae, which were treated with a series of concentrations (1 × 102, 1 × 104, 1 × 106, and 1 × 108 conidia/ml). The mortality percentages of immature stages were 15.98-100%, males 15.94%-100%, and females (28.92%-100%) with an estimated LC50 value of 24.09×103, 35.43×103, and 11.03×103 conidia/ml, respectively. Furthermore, electron microscopy confirmed the ability of B. bassiana to infect T. urticae. The results indicated that B. bassiana spores attached to the T. urticae spider body within about 12 hours. The germination of spores increased within 24-36 and penetrated the T. urticae cuticle after 96 hours of exposure.

ABSTRACT:
The increasing demand for sustainable food packaging has sparked interest in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) derived from renewable oil palm biomass. This study utilized BiOzCMC, a novel CMC synthesized from ozonated Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB) using green ozonolysis pre-treatment and carboxymethylation. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Fractional Factorial Design (FFD) were applied to optimize sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration, sodium monochloroacetate (SMCA) ratio, reaction time, and temperature. The optimised BiOzCMC (R2 98.24 %) achieved a Degree of Substitution (DS) of 1.2, 250.2 % yield, 75 % purity, and 5.05 % moisture content. Analysis was conducted using several techniques, including X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Particle Size Analysis (PSA). The results revealed a decrease in crystallinity (5.15 %), well-defined carboxyl peaks, a smoother morphology, higher thermal stability, and a smaller particle size (0.95 μm) compared to commercial carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCc). BiOzCMC extended the shelf life, reduced weight loss, improved mechanical properties, and suppressed microbial growth for over a month when used as an additive to coat tomatoes. These results highlight BiOzCMC as a sustainable food coating additive supporting waste valorisation.

ABSTRACT:
We evaluated the Lattice di-SIM 3D structural illumination method with a focus on Promyelocytic Leukemia Nuclear Bodies (PML NBs). Lattice SIM2's performance was compared to its predecessor using biological samples and calibration beads. Optimized SIM2 parameters revealed PML NBs with a distinct ring-like morphology. Furthermore, we compared Lattice-SIM2 with dSTORM, finding a strong correlation between blinking events and the SIM2 mask. For 2D nanoscopic correlation, we used the long-lived imaging buffer Eternity, while the modified variant, Eternity-SIM, with a higher refractive index, provided improved 3D correlation for SIM2 imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as natural therapeutic delivery systems (DDS). A critical challenge in realizing this potential is the loading of nucleic acids, particularly mRNA, a high molecular weight and very sensitive biomolecule, for which the loading efficiency into EVs is often low. Despite the growing interest in EV-based delivery platforms, relatively few studies have reported efficient loading techniques, and inconsistent or misleading information in the literature hinders progress towards the development of reliable loading of mRNA into EV-based systems. Addressing this gap systematically and quantitatively is crucial for the clinical translation of EVs as DDS. In this study, we compared five different exogenous mRNA loading methods (incubation, sonication, freeze-thaw, electroporation and extrusion) and evaluated their loading efficiencies, as well as their biophysical, biochemical, and functional properties. Here, using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), as an efficient and reliable characterization approach to assess mRNA loading efficiency into EVs we visualized single EVs and single mRNA molecules and to estimate the percentage of loaded EVs as well as the amount of mRNA molecules loaded per EV. Interestingly, all five strategies demonstrated a high yield of EVs associated with mRNA, with up to 70 % of EVs successfully containing or in contact with mRNA, with minimal disruption to the intrinsic properties of EVs. Although some discrepancies between loading efficiencies, functionality and amount of mRNA molecules per EV, freeze-thaw proved to be the most effective in terms of loading efficiency and amount of mRNA associated molecules per EV. Overall, mRNA incorporation using these exogenous methods remained inefficient and presented significant challenges for large-scale implementation due to substantial mRNA loss. Despite this limitation, the high proportion of successfully loaded or mRNA associated EVs, particularly with freeze-thaw and electroporation, provides, for the first time, a promising foundation for the advancing of mRNA loading on EV-based therapeutic applications.

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) technology based on contrast agents has shown great potential in in vivo microvascular blood flow imaging and has become a hot topic in the industry in recent years. SRUS represented by ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) eliminates the point spread function (PSF) caused by diffraction by localizing sparse microbubbles in the image, and then constructs a super-resolution blood flow structure map through long-term image accumulation. It is worth mentioning that almost all current super-resolution strategies, including ULM, adopt postimage processing strategies. In optics, in addition to postimage processing super-resolution techniques, the design of the illumination light field is also a popular super-resolution imaging method. This inspired us to design the acoustic field to achieve a super-resolution blood flow imaging strategy based on structured acoustic field illumination. In this article, we propose a new structured acoustic field illumination design method, which achieves 2-D structured acoustic field design by improving the acoustic field calculation of Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm (GSA) based on Talbot effect. At the same time, we have designed a corresponding structured acoustic field reconstruction strategy that can adaptively reconstruct any structured illumination method, and the reconstructed image frame rate is comparable to that of multiangle plane wave. Combined with image postprocessing methods, we have obtained contrast-enhanced structured illumination ultrasound (CE-SIU), which reduces the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the microbubble PSF, breaking through the lateral resolution limit of contrast-enhanced imaging. The super-resolution strategy based on acoustic field design proposed in this study provides new insights and perspectives for the development of the overall technical route of SRUS.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) uses a set of images captured with different illumination patterns to computationally reconstruct resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Here, we propose an alternative approach using a single speckle illumination pattern and relying on inherent sample motion to encode the super-resolved information in multiple raw images. From a set of raw fluorescence images captured as the sample moves, we jointly estimate both the sample motion and the super-resolved image. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method both in simulation and in experiment.

ABSTRACT:
We present the development of a custom-built structured illumination microscope (SIM) featuring a specially designed transmission diffraction grating. Employing the analog microfilming method, we fabricated transmission diffraction gratings suited to the specific requirements of our system. This robust and cost-effective method allows for the fabrication of diffraction gratings with customized constants, ensuring excellent transmission in both the visible and near-infrared spectra. Additionally, to assess the performance of our system, we measured the resolution in both epifluorescent and super-resolution imaging modalities by applying two independent methods: the conventional resolution measurement using fluorescent beads and the knife-edge technique applied on the MoS2 monolayer flakes. Both methods confirmed enhancement in the resolution of SIM over the epifluorescent imaging modality. Furthermore, we have successfully demonstrated the capabilities of our microscope by imaging fluorescently labeled astrocytes, specifically targeting the vimentin filament protein within these cells. The super-resolution images reveal fine structures of the vimentin cytoskeleton that remain unresolved in the epifluorescent image.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a widely adopted super-resolution imaging technique. Conventional 3D-SIM requires at least 15 exposures at each z-plane to achieve ∼2 × improved lateral and axial resolution. However, this requirement for a large number of exposures for "super-resolution" exacerbates photobleaching and slows imaging speed, thus significantly limiting its application in volumetric biological imaging. Here, we introduce multi-scan SIM (MS-SIM) that integrates a simple beam splitter for simultaneously imaging three different focal planes and a deformable mirror that enables rapid z-scanning over three contiguous sub-volumes. We demonstrate the MS-SIM system through high-quality live whole cell SIM imaging at ∼1 Hz. The high efficiency and flexibility of MS-SIM can significantly impact 3D super-resolution imaging of biological and dense colloidal systems.

ABSTRACT:
A scanning single-pixel imaging method based on binary random structured illumination is proposed. The method employs a simple optical system and a binary spatial light modulator. The desired illumination intensity distribution can be generated at arbitrary planes through computational propagation of a binary random pattern, enabling image reconstruction at various depths and thus achieving three-dimensional imaging. In contrast to conventional computational ghost imaging, the proposed method achieves imaging by scanning a single binary random pattern, eliminating the need to regenerate a new pattern, to our knowledge, for each measurement. The effectiveness of the method is validated through numerical simulations and optical experiments. Additionally, the results demonstrate that increasing the number of pixels in the binary random pattern leads to improved image quality.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) exhibits high precision and robust measurement performance on complex surfaces. Continuous vertical scanning structured illumination microscopy (CVS-SIM) reduces the number of structured illumination patterns through continuous scanning to enhance measurement efficiency and has gained widespread attention. However, constrained by limited acquisition information, CVS-SIM suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio and degraded reconstruction accuracy in complex surface topography reconstruction due to dynamic background intensity fluctuations, non-uniform surface reflectance characteristics, and substantial local slope variations. To solve the above problems, this study proposes a robust optical sectioning method integrating sliding-window background estimation with Hilbert transform-based contrast-weighted HiLo image fusion. The proposed method employs sliding-window averaging filtering and adaptive band-stop filtering to estimate dynamic background intensity while suppressing residual noise interference. Furthermore, it utilizes the Hilbert transform to decode and separate carrier and envelope signals, combined with a fringe contrast-weighted HiLo fusion strategy, effectively reducing noise impact on optical sectioning. Experimental results demonstrate that for a through-glass-via sample with steep local slopes, the proposed method achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in axial modulation response compared to conventional methods, reducing reconstruction error from 1.458 µm to 0.104 µm. For the samples with complex textures and reflectivity variations, such as redistribution layer structures and interdigitated electrodes, the method maintains measurement accuracy and lateral resolution while suppressing surface measurement noise by over 51%. Comprehensive testing across various samples confirms that the proposed method achieves consistent high-quality surface reconstruction across diverse surface topographies.

ABSTRACT:
Haematococcus pluvialis (HP) is a freshwater alga known for its ability to accumulate the potent antioxidant astaxanthin, which has extensive applications in aquaculture, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Astaxanthin rapidly accumulates under unfavorable environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms of astaxanthin accumulation under various stress conditions remain unclear. This mainly stems from the limitations of current imaging techniques, which lack super-resolution, label-free, and three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities. In this study, we employed scanning structured illumination microscopy (SSIM) to achieve dynamic 3D ultrastructural reconstructions of HP cells under various stress conditions. This advanced imaging approach allowed us to closely observe the stress responses of HP cells, revealing significant morphological changes induced by different stressors. Additionally, we examined alterations in the HP cell wall under these conditions and explored the relationship between these morphological changes and the rate of astaxanthin accumulation during identical stress durations. The results clearly demonstrate that light stress, which induces a more comprehensive disruption of the entire cell, leads to a faster rate of astaxanthin accumulation compared to salt stress, which exerts its effects from the exterior inward. The rate of astaxanthin accumulation under light stress is approximately twice that observed under salt stress conditions. Our findings offer new insights into the subcellular dynamics of astaxanthin accumulation in HP, underscoring the effectiveness of super-resolution techniques in clarifying these processes.

ABSTRACT:
For decades, electron microscopy has been the primary method to visualize ultrastructural details of the kidney, including podocyte foot processes and the slit diaphragm. Despite its status as the gold standard, electron microscopy has significant limitations: it requires laborious sample preparation, works only with very small samples, is mainly qualitative, and is prone to misinterpretation because of section angle bias. In addition, combining imaging and protein staining with antibodies poses a challenge, limiting electron microscopy's integration into routine research and diagnostic workflows. As imaging technology advances, super-resolution microscopy, with an optical resolution below 100 nm, presents a promising alternative for detailed insights into glomerular ultrastructure. This review explores various super-resolution techniques, particularly 3-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, and demonstrates how they can be applied to standard histological sections. The 3-dimensional structured illumination microscopy-based measurement procedure-podocyte exact morphology measurement procedure-offers a novel approach to quantifying podocyte foot process morphology and can detect podocyte foot process changes even before proteinuria is present. Furthermore, the podocyte exact morphology measurement procedure can be combined with mRNA detection, multiplex staining, and deep learning algorithms, making it a powerful tool for kidney research, preclinical studies, and personalized diagnostics. This advancement has the potential to accelerate drug development and enhance therapeutic precision, heralding a new era of high-precision nephrology.

ABSTRACT:
Zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) nanohole enables single molecule detection via zeptoliter-scale confinement, yet excitation-induced fluctuations in fluorescence intensity hinder throughput improvement. Here, we develop a structured illumination method combining waveguide standing-wave fields with nanohole optics to homogenize intensity distribution over a large scale. Simulation results present that a nanohole array illuminated by a standing-wave evanescent field experiences coherent Rayleigh backscattering and re-distributes the exponentially decayed intensity along the waveguide path. Together with the nanohole's contour-determined optical characteristic, this produces a uniform intensity profile up to 6%, similar to free-space flat-field illumination of quantitative microscopy. This approach overcomes the limit imposed by high loss and has the potential in developing high-throughput on-chip single-molecule detection devices.

ABSTRACT:
Optical scanning holography (OSH) is a powerful computational imaging technique that encodes three-dimensional (3D) information of an incoherently illuminated or self-luminous object into 2D holograms using Fresnel zone patterns (FZPs) as structured illumination. However, conventional OSH methods require complex setups with mechanical scanning or multi-frame phase-shifting devices, limiting their imaging efficiency and system stability. In this Letter, we propose compressive motionless optical scanning holography (CMOSH), a novel, to the best of our knowledge, framework that eliminates the need for phase shifting and mechanical scanning in 3D incoherent holography. The unique combination of compressive holography and motionless OSH enables single-scan, twin-image-free holographic reconstructions, significantly improving the system stability and imaging throughput. It also provides true 3D depth-resolved imaging, accurately resolving multi-layer samples while eliminating defocused information. The effectiveness of CMOSH is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations, highlighting its potential for robust and efficient 3D holographic imaging across diverse applications.

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondrial plasticity, coordinated by fission and fusion, is crucial to ensure cellular functions. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the GTPase Drp1 at the constriction site, which is proposed to be driven by the actin-myosin contractile force. However, the mechanism that propels constriction remains unclear, and the potential involvement of additional mechanisms in this process remains an open question. Here, using structured illumination microscopy, electron microscopy, and correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM), we show that the type III intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) participates in mitochondria constriction and fission by interacting with Drp1. Remarkably, loss of GFAP results in hyperfused mitochondria under physiological and even Ca2+-induced mitochondrial fission conditions. Additionally, mutations in GFAP, the cause of Alexander disease, result in more Drp1 localized to GFAP and lead to significantly increased mitochondrial fissions. Taken together, these findings propose a role of type III intermediate filaments in mitochondrial division.

ABSTRACT:
This study introduces an innovative nanophotonic biosensor system designed to explore exosome dynamics within the gut-brain axis, highlighting the bidirectional and biochemical communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The proposed system incorporates coculture environments for various cell types, microfluidic control of exosomes, and super-resolution imaging capabilities for both exosomes and live cells. While enabling real-time observation of long-range exosome dynamics within the gut-brain-axis-on-a-chip, this approach offers superior spatial resolution for visualizing individual exosomes in both donor and recipient cells. Through precise microfluidic manipulation, exosomes are observed as they are secreted from donor cells, transported within the chip, and interact with recipient cells in a coculture environment, mimicking the communication process occurring in the gut-brain axis. The dynamics of exosome transport within the gut-brain axis model are expected to improve the understanding of their biological functions and potential applications.

ABSTRACT:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health concern that complicates the effective treatment of infections, resulting in an increased severity of illness and elevated healthcare costs. Traditional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) relies on laborious culturing and interpretation of visible growth, resulting in delays ranging from 24 h to several days. Genotypic assays detect only known resistance genes and cannot anticipate novel or emerging variants. Consequently, there is an urgent need for rapid, accurate AST methods that minimize culture time and increase detection resolution. We developed a rapid phenotypic AST platform that integrates structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging and deep learning to assess subcellular phenotypes in bacteria treated with antibiotics. Seven deep learning architectures, including C3D, DenseNet-121, MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3 Large, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and MobileNet-V3 Small were trained on phenotypic image data sets. ResNet-50 achieved optimal performance, delivering AST results with 87% accuracy in under 20 min for E. coli, 4 h for M. smegmatis, and 15 h for BCG, all in strong agreement with conventional assays. We applied single-cell analysis at antibiotic concentrations near the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and found that some cells were inhibited below the population MIC while others remained viable above it, revealing heterogeneity masked by conventional AST. Our method enables subcellular-level rapid phenotypic AST, with no need for culture requirements, and is suitable for assessing the fast effectiveness of antibiotics. Observing single-cell heterogeneity provides a tool for elucidating resistance mechanisms and informing timely clinical decision-making with the potential to curb the spread of AMR.

ABSTRACT:
Cellular membranes are dynamic, heterogeneous structures where lipid nanodomains (e.g., lipid rafts) play key roles in signaling, membrane trafficking, and protein function. Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) reveals the spatial organization of these nanoscale features; however, traditional analyses focus only on spatial patterns and neglect biochemical and biophysical properties critical for membrane function. By combining SMLM with environmentally sensitive fluorescent probes, such as di-4-ANEPPDHQ, we can produce marked point patterns that couple spatial coordinates with environmental information, such as membrane lipid order quantified by generalized polarization (GP) values. Unfortunately, existing methods do not adequately compare these complex data sets. Here, we introduce a new method, which assesses the similarities of marked point patterns by considering the spatial arrangement as well as the biophysical properties of the data. The method computes three semi-independent Kolmogorov-Smirnov scores which are used to map comparisons between two point clouds in 3D space. This allows the distance to the origin of a comparison to be used as a metric for similarity. Application to simulated data confirms the reliability of the method, while application to experimental GP-marked point patterns identifies condition-dependent variations in lipid order. This framework thus offers a versatile tool for the study of biochemical and biophysical properties of cellular nanoenvironments, enabling new insight into membrane organization and function.

ABSTRACT:
The low degree of labeling and limited photon count of fluorescent emitters in single molecule localization microscopy results in poor quality images of macro-molecular complexes. Particle fusion provides a single reconstruction with high signal-to-noise ratio by combining many single molecule localization microscopy images of the same structure. The underlying assumption of homogeneity is not always valid, heterogeneity can arise due to geometrical shape variations or distinct conformational states. We introduce a Point Cloud Variational Auto-Encoder that works directly on 2D and 3D localization data, to detect multiple modes of variation in such datasets. The computing time is on the order of a few minutes, enabled by the linear scaling with dataset size, and fast network training in just four epochs. The use of lists of localization data instead of pixelated images leads to just minor differences in computational burden between 2D and 3D cases. With the proposed method, we detected radius variation in 2D Nuclear Pore Complex data, height variations in 3D DNA origami tetrahedron data, and both radius and height variations in 3D Nuclear Pore Complex data. In all cases, the detected variations were on the few nanometer scale.

ABSTRACT:
Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs) of the EosFP family are commonly used in ensemble pulse-chase and single-molecule localization or tracking approaches. However, these fluorescent proteins exhibit highly complex photophysical behaviors. In the green-form, recent NMR experiments revealed that mEos4b and other PCFP variants exist in two different conformational states at thermal equilibrium, which limits their effective photoconversion efficiency. Here, we investigate the conformational heterogeneity of mEos4b in the photoconverted red-form, employing a combination of solution NMR, UV-vis spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging. Only a single red population of mEos4b is observed at thermal equilibrium. However, a second population emerges under illumination with 405 or 488 nm light, which slowly decays in the dark or can be swiftly reverted under 561 nm light. This second population manifests itself through a pH-dependent positive photoswitching mechanism that adds to the already characterized negative photoswitching assigned to cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore. Our data indicate that positive photoswitching, instead, results from the light-induced formation of a second fluorescent state with a cis configuration of the chromophore that exhibits a substantially increased pKa. Such a mechanism, suggested to result from rewiring of the H-bonding network around the first amino acid of the chromophore, adds to the panoply of switching scenarios observed in fluorescent proteins. It bears consequences for the spectroscopic characterization of PCFPs, reduces their apparent brightness and generates short-lived off-times perturbing single-molecule localization microscopy applications.

ABSTRACT:
Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs) serve as key players in single-molecule localization super-resolution imaging. As an early engineered variant, mEos3.2 has limited applications, mostly due to its slow maturation rate. The recent advent of a novel variant, pcStar, obtained by the simple mutation of only three amino acids (D28E/L93M/N166G) in mEos3.2, exhibits significantly accelerated maturation and enhanced fluorescent brightness. This improvement represents an important advance in the field of biofluorescence by enabling early detection with reliable signals, essential for labelling dynamic biological processes. However, the mechanism underlying the significant improvement in fluorescent performance from mEos3.2 to pcStar remains elusive, preventing the rational design of more robust variants through mutagenesis. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of mEos3.2 and pcStar in their green states at atomic resolution and performed molecular-dynamics simulations to reveal significant divergences between the two proteins. Our structural and computational analyses revealed crucial features that are distinctively present in pcStar, including the presence of an extra solvent molecule, high conformational stability and enhanced interactions of the chromophore with its surroundings, tighter tertiary-structure packing and dynamic central-helical deformation. Resulting from the triple mutations, all of these structural features are likely to establish a mechanistic link to the greatly improved fluorescent performance of pcStar. The data described here not only provide a good example illustrating how distant amino-acid substitutions can affect the structure and bioactivity of a protein, but also give rise to strategic considerations for the future engineering of more widely applicable PCFPs.

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution imaging has gained significant traction in recent years due to its unprecedented ability to visualize target biomolecules at nanometer resolution. Here, the capability is demonstrated to detect target pairs that are in close proximity by exploiting base-stacking interactions between two DNA strands, each labelling one target. The DNA probes hybridize transiently with the each other only when both target molecules are proximal, thus creating a hybridization site for fluorophore-conjugated DNA strand, called imager. In this design, hybridization and co-axial base-stacking act synergistically to enable imager binding, with stacking interactions providing essential stabilization that allows for transient hybridization. This synergy generates the stochastic binding events required for DNA-PAINT imaging, which it call Stack-Proximity-PAINT (Stack-pPAINT). To gain mechanistic insights into hybridization of the probe, atomistic equilibrium and steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed. The simulations reveal that DNA base-stacking and fluorophore stacking together stabilize the imager. Programmable DNA nanostructures are utilized to benchmark the applicability of Stack-pPAINT. As a cellular proof of concept, microtubular structures are visualized using Stack-pPAINT with antibodies targeting both alpha- and beta-tubulin molecules. This probe technology offers promising applications in cell biology research aimed at elucidating spatial interactomes at high resolution within cells.

ABSTRACT:
Self-assembled DNA nanostructures have been popularly used to develop DNA-based electrochemical sensors by exploiting the nanoscale positioning capability of DNA origami. However, the impact of the electric field on the structural stability of the DNA origami framework and the activity of carried DNA probes remains to be explored. Herein, we employ DNA origami as structural frameworks for reversible DNA hybridization, and develop a single-molecule fluorescence imaging method to quantify electric field effects on DNA conformation and hybridization properties at the single-molecule level. Through single-molecule temporal kinetic analysis of hybridization events occurring on individual DNA origami, we systematically determine the regulation patterns of applied potential and scanning duration on the activity of DNA probes. Optical super-resolution reconstruction of probe sites reveals electric field-induced structural relaxation in DNA frameworks. This approach not only provides insights into electrochemical DNA sensing devices, but also lays the foundation for developing hybrid electrical-optical analysis at the single-molecule level.

ABSTRACT:
MINimal photon FLUXes (MINFLUX) offers nanometer localization precision, with lower fluorophore requirements than for other super-resolution microscopy (SRM) techniques. Nonetheless, low localization probabilities hamper its application, and use of less bright and photostable fluorophores, including near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores has been difficult to realize. Here, we devised strategies overcoming these limitations. We systematically studied the blinking properties of far-red and NIR cyanine fluorophores, followed by simulations of MINFLUX localizations, over typical time scales (microsecond to 10 milliseconds), sample and excitation conditions for MINFLUX imaging. We identified fluorophore blinking via photoisomerization and photoreduction as the main cause of localization errors, and that use of balanced redox buffers and repetitive excitation beam scans can suppress such errors. Implementing these strategies, we could demonstrate NIR-MINFLUX imaging with nanometer localization precision, thereby also presenting an overall strategy to design optimal sample and excitation conditions, for MINFLUX imaging and for SRM in general.

ABSTRACT:
The nucleolus, a membraneless organelle crucial for ribosome production, has a unique nanoscale structure whose organization is responsive to cell signals and disease progression. Here, we highlight the potential of Expansion Microscopy (ExM) for capturing intricate spatial and functional information about membraneless organelles such as the nucleolus and nuclear foci. We apply dual protein Expansion Microscopy (dual-proExM) in combination with click Expansion Microscopy (click-ExM) to capture images at the highest resolution reported for the nucleolus of ∼45 ± 2 nm. Inhibition of nucleolar processes triggers a nucleolar stress response, causing distinct structural rearrangements whose molecular basis is an area of active investigation. We investigate time-dependent changes in nucleolar structure and function under nucleolar stress induced by oxaliplatin, actinomycin D, and other platinum-based compounds. Our findings reveal new stages that occur prior to the complete sequestration of RNA Pol I into nucleolar caps, shedding light on the early mechanisms of the nucleolar stress response. RNA transcription is linked to nanoscale protein rearrangements using a combination of click-ExM and pro-ExM, revealing locations of active transcripts during the early stages of nucleolar stress reorganization. With prolonged stress, fibrillarin and NPM1 segregate from the nucleolus into nucleoplasmic foci that are for the first time imaged at nanometer resolution. In addition to revealing new morphological information about the nucleolus, this study demonstrates the potential of ExM for imaging membraneless organelles with nanometer-scale precision.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Current microscopy approaches applied to platelet aggregates from multiple settings indicate their structure has important implications for efficient hemostasis and in clinical treatment of thrombosis. However, current fluorescence microscopy approaches are not amenable to detailed volumetric imaging of platelet aggregate structures. This is due to the small size of individual platelets and tight packing of platelets within aggregates, resulting in optical opacity. OBJECTIVES: To address this, we investigated methods of performing superresolution microscopy and image analysis on aggregates of platelets to describe their morphology. METHODS: We applied expansion microscopy and custom analysis workflows to extract quantitative information on the structure of platelet aggregates. RESULTS: We demonstrated that expansion microscopy applied to platelet aggregates revealed multiscale information about their structure. We produced volumetric images at nanoscale resolution of >700 platelet aggregates stained for cytoskeletal and membrane components under normal conditions and following cytoskeletal disruption. We demonstrated that our custom analysis workflow provided quantitative description of platelet numbers, volumes, and morphology within entire platelet aggregates. Additionally, we quantitatively described subcellular organization of F-actin. By comparing these measurements following treatment with actin inhibitors, cytochalasin D, and latrunculin A, we could robustly detect structural disruptions in platelet aggregates. CONCLUSION: Together, these data provide a workflow to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the architecture of platelet aggregates at a range of scales (whole aggregates down to subcellular features within individual platelets). This provides an important tool for analysis of platelet aggregates and thrombi in conditions such as hemostasis, immunothrombosis, and cardiovascular disease.

We applied expansion microscopy and custom analysis workflows to extract quantitative information on the structure of platelet aggregates.

DOI: 10.1016/j.parint.2024.103023

ABSTRACT:
Dense granules (DG) are understudied apical organelles in merozoites, the malaria parasite stage that invades erythrocytes. Only six proteins have been identified which localize to DGs, despite that DG proteins play crucial roles in multiple steps of intraerythrocytic parasite development. To develop a tool for investigating DG structure and function, this study applied ultrastructural expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to visualize the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) in Plasmodium falciparum merozoites. Merozoites were expanded to approximately four times their original size, allowing the identification of DGs without the need for electron microscopy. RESA localization in merozoite DGs was confirmed by staining with a combination of anti-RESA mAb and protein staining by NHS-ester. The translocation of RESA to the infected erythrocyte membrane was also observed in early ring-stage parasites. These results are in good agreement with the RESA localization reported using immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). By using U-ExM, the identification of novel DG proteins will be facilitated without time-consuming IEM, thereby enhancing our understanding of erythrocyte parasitism by P. falciparum.

ABSTRACT:
Expansion microscopy (ExM) enables superresolution imaging by embedding biological specimens in a swellable hydrogel, followed by optical clearing and physical expansion. Here we present a detailed protocol for applying ExM to embryonic stages of Paracentrotus lividus, a widely used model in developmental biology. Embryos at cleavage and gastrula stages, as well as pluteus larvae, were successfully expanded fourfold after proteinase digestion. Preexpansion Airyscan imaging provided only limited subcellular information due to autofluorescence, whereas post-expansion samples displayed markedly reduced background and resolved fine structures. To address distortions caused by the calcified skeleton in pluteus larvae, we incorporated a decalcification step with EDTA, which preserved morphology and enabled isotropic expansion. Distinct NHS ester dyes further allowed differential labelling of the fertilisation envelope and blastomeres, illustrating the versatility of this approach. Together, these adaptations establish a reproducible workflow for ExM in marine invertebrates, offering a valuable methodological resource and a foundation for future applications in developmental and environmental research.

ABSTRACT:
Visualization of proteins and nucleic acids with super-resolution is a persistent need. Expansion microscopy (ExM) permits nanoscale imaging of biomolecules on a conventional microscope by physically expanding biological specimens embedded in a stretchable hydrogel. However, achieving simultaneous super-resolution co-imaging of proteins and nucleic acids on ExM has remained a general challenge. Here, we present photoclick dual anchoring expansion microscopy (Phan-ExM), which employs an unorthodox anchoring reagent, N-(3-methacrylamidopropyl)-3-(2-methyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-2H-tetrazole-2-carboxamide (MAP-mPyTC), for the rapid and concurrent retention of proteins and nucleic acids within the ExM gel matrix through photoclick chemistry. We demonstrated that MAP-mPyTC could anchor both protein and mRNA biomolecules within 10 min, significantly reducing the time compared to typical ExM techniques, which usually take from several hours to overnight. Moreover, we showed that Phan-ExM significantly enhanced the fluorescence intensity of protein and RNA spots compared to previous methods. With Phan-ExM, we achieved high-resolution co-imaging of multiplex proteins and nucleic acids on a single specimen at ∼85 nm resolution. We revealed that paclitaxel and colchicine treatment significantly disrupted mitochondrial dynamics in BALB/c3T3 cells, with an associated aggregation of ACTB mRNA observed at sites of mitochondrial damage. Phan-ExM is a platform technique that enables super-resolution co-localization of nucleic acids and proteins on the same specimen using a conventional microscope.

ABSTRACT:
A significant challenge in Drosophila centriole biology is its small size. Advanced super-resolution techniques have provided valuable insights, but require specialized equipment and can be difficult to implement in tissues. Expansion Microscopy (ExM) offers an accessible alternative, yet its application in Drosophila centriole research has been sparse. We provide an ExM protocol for cultured S2 cells and fly tissues that revealed new insights into pro-centriole biology. In S2 cells we document overduplication in the form of the classic "rosettes", while in spermatids we uncover an unexpected movement of the pro-centriole-like structure (PCL). ExM has also refined existing molecular models. In S2 cells we document the distal tip protein Cep97 as a ring, which clarifies its role in capping the growing centriole. In spermatids, we spatially segregated the inner nuclear membrane protein Spag4 and the cytoplasmic protein Yuri, which led to the new hypothesis that they play independent roles at the centriole-nucleus contact site. Finally, we show that our ExM protocol is a hypothesis-generator and discovery tool applicable beyond Drosophila centrioles by imaging synaptonemal complexes in the Plodia interpunctella moth.

ABSTRACT:
Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuation (SRRF) enables live-cell super-resolution imaging, but requires careful parameter selection. Here, we quantify the impact of NanoJ-SRRF parameters on microtubule imaging using FWHM and SQUIRREL-based error mapping. Ring radius proved most critical, with values >1.0 degrading resolution and fidelity. Radiality magnification and axes in ring had minimal impact. Advanced parameters revealed pitfalls: "remove positivity constraint" degraded resolution by 43%, while gradient weighting catastrophically reduced fidelity (RSP = 0.204 ± 0.116). Temporal Radiality Average (TRA) outperformed Temporal Radiality Auto-Correlations (TRAC), milimizing artifacts. This study establishes the first evidence-based guidelines for live-cell tubulin imaging: ring radius ≤1.0, TRA mode prioritization, and avoidance of gradient weighting. Integrating FWHM and SQUIRREL offers a robust opitimization framework for cytoskeletal dynamics. Using FWHM and SQUIRREL, we optimized NanoJ-SRRF parameters for live-cell tubulin imaging. Ring radius ≤1.0, TRA mode, and avoidance of gradient weighting achieved 150 nm resolution with minimal artifacts. A detailed protocol is in Supplementary Materials.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence polarization imaging provides critical insights into molecular orientation, yet existing methods face limitations in parameter extraction efficiency and implementation complexity. This study proposes Wide-Field Multiparametric Fluorescence Imaging (WMPFI) using a Liquid Crystal Polarization Rotator (LCPR) for rapid polarization state modulation that generates pixel-level intensity modulations that encode fluorophore orientation. By analyzing fluorescence intensity variations under different polarization excitations, WMPFI reconstructs sample structural information through parametric imaging without requiring optical lock-in detection or computational reconstruction algorithms. Comparative experiments with Conventional Microscopy (CM) demonstrate WMPFI's enhanced sensitivity to anisotropic fluorescent dipole orientations, achieving superior contrast and resolution in imaging neural stem cells and skin tissues. The method's capacity for multi-parameter acquisition through polarization modulation offers a simplified approach for probing subcellular material exchange dynamics, with potential extensions to super-resolution imaging modalities.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence-based optical techniques are developing rapidly, giving access to high spatiotemporal information on live biological systems with single molecule sensitivity. However, these techniques are typically restricted to expert labs and are not easilyaccessibleto the general user. While the development of customized systems and their wider distribution is difficult, as it requires expert manpower, software developments are easy to distribute. However, in reality only few users outside an expert community are exploring and using these tools. This is due to theusabilityof the software which often requires expert skills to operate and is neither intuitive nor easy to use. These issues of accessibility and usability limit the spread of state-of-the-art techniques. And while accessibility of custom instrumentation is difficult to solve, the accessibility and usability of software is an easier target. In this perspective, therefore, we concentrate on the software issue and examine the major translational barriers that prevent biologists from adopting the available fluorescence microscopy techniques. We discuss key developments in the field such as open-source tools, standardized file formats and AI-driven analysis platforms, and suggest a roadmap to bring advanced tools to a wider community.

ABSTRACT:
Optical nanoscopy of intact biological specimens has been transformed by recent advancements in hydrogel-based tissue clearing and expansion, enabling the imaging of cellular and subcellular structures with molecular contrast. However, existing high-resolution fluorescence microscopes are physically limited by objective-to-specimen distance, which prevents the study of whole-mount specimens without physical sectioning. To address this challenge, we developed a photochemical strategy for spatially precise sectioning of specimens. By combining serial photochemical sectioning with lattice light-sheet imaging and petabyte-scale computation, we imaged and reconstructed axons and myelin sheaths across entire mouse olfactory bulbs at nanoscale resolution. An olfactory bulb-wide analysis of myelinated and unmyelinated axons revealed distinctive patterns of axon degeneration and de-/dysmyelination in the neurodegenerative brain, highlighting the potential for peta- to exabyte-scale super-resolution studies using this approach.

ABSTRACT:
Recent years have witnessed significant advances in overcoming the resolution limits of traditional optical imaging, particularly in fluorescence-based super-resolution microscopy. In contrast, label-free super-resolution microscopy eliminates the need for sample staining, offering broader applicability. However, most label-free methods often rely on saturation effects or nonlinearity, which limits their applicability. Here, we have developed a reflection label-free super-resolution confocal optical microscopy technique based on super-resolution focusing. Illuminating a conventional objective lens with a hollow beam generates a super-resolution focal spot at its front focal plane. By utilizing the confocal configuration, the same objective lens is used to collect the reflected and scattered light. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed label-free super-resolution confocal microscope resolves a grating with a pitch of 160 nm and a line width of 80 nm. This technology has potential applications in biological and non-biological microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Photocatalytic reactions leveraging nanoscale catalyst particles are vital for sustainable environmental remediation but often involve highly complex mechanisms that are difficult to probe due to the pervasive spatiotemporal heterogeneities in the structure and reactivity of the constituent nanosized photocatalyst particles. Super-resolution reaction imaging, with its high spatial and temporal resolution under realistic operando conditions, enables the real-time observation of photocatalytic reaction kinetics and multifaceted charge carrier behaviors at the nanoscale. However, no comprehensive review has yet explored how state-of-the-art super-resolution reaction imaging techniques inform the photocatalyst design for water treatment. This review aims to bridge that gap by providing an overview of the principles and unique advantages of super-resolution catalysis microscopy and related operando imaging tools. We also highlight how these in situ operando techniques can be applied to investigate structure-property relationships in photocatalysts at the single particle and subparticle levels. Key aspects such as size effects, crystal facet effects, bimetallic effects, heterojunction interface effects, defect effects, and particle aggregation effects will be examined through recent case studies, focusing on their impact on photocatalytic water decontamination efficiency. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions of leveraging super-resolution microscopy to distill materials design principles in advancing photocatalytic water treatment.

ABSTRACT:
Weakly scattering samples such as low-refractive-index nanomaterials present significant challenges in super-resolution imaging, because their weak scattering signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise. Here, we propose microsphere-enhanced evanescent light illumination microscopy (MS-EIM) for the label-free super-resolution imaging of weakly scattering samples. We used the MS-EIM method to perform simulated imaging of transparent samples with a 100-nm gap to investigate its imaging performance. Subsequently, the feasibility of MS-EIM for super-resolution imaging of weakly scattering samples was experimentally validated. This MS-EIM is a wide-field, real-time imaging technique with potential applications in the field of high-speed, label-free biomedical imaging.

ABSTRACT:
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a crucial tool for characterizing material microstructures, and it is renowned for its high resolution and depth of field. However, SEM image quality is affected by the scanning speed and resolution settings. When using SEM to capture fast-changing dynamic processes and other specific tasks, maintaining high image quality while using fast scanning mode is often tricky. To address these challenges, this paper introduces introduce an efficient two-stage diffusion model for accelerated SEM image super-resolution named ETDMS. The image denoising and super-resolution were divided into independent tasks based on SEM imaging principles and completed in two separate stages. Specifically, in Stage 2, a conditional lightweight encoder-decoder architecture SR network is proposed to replace the large U-Net in the traditional diffusion model and combine it with accelerated sampling technology to improve image generation efficiency. Experimental results prove that compared with previous super-resolution methods, the images generated by ETDMS significantly improve evaluation parameters, subjective visual quality, and detail generation.

ABSTRACT:
Conventional confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) requires a trade-off between image quality and resolution. Image scanning microscopy (ISM) uses an array detector to improve this issue, but its diffraction-limited resolution improvement is capped at twice that of CLSM. Here, we demonstrate a novel lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) based super-resolution approach, termed nonsaturated hyperlinear upconversion image scanning microscopy (UISM). By modulating the excitation power of UCNPs during image acquisition, the hyperlinear response of UCNPs can be tuned at the nonsaturated excitation threshold to obtain a shrunken point spread function, enabling resolution enhancement far beyond twice that of CLSM. Utilizing nonsaturating near-infrared excitation at 980 nm, we achieve spatial resolutions of 133 and 196 nm for emissions at 455 and 800 nm, respectively, corresponding to approximately 1/5th and 1/8th of the excitation wavelength. This work suggests a novel strategy for improving image resolution in laser point-scanning microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, we introduce a novel, to our knowledge, on-chip holographic microscopy system that integrates an electrically tunable lens (ETL) with a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to achieve both a large-field-of-view and high-resolution imaging. A single LED is used as the point light source, which is structured through the electrically tunable system and a microscope objective. By modulating the ETL current, we enable precise z-axis movement of the point light source without the need for mechanical motion. Concurrently, the generated holograms exhibit sub-pixel shifts along the x and y axes. By employing a regularized super-resolution reconstruction algorithm, high-resolution images are obtained simultaneously. We performed full-field-of-view (FOV) reconstruction of a USAF phase resolution target (∼10.03 mm2) and achieved a lateral resolution of 1.38 μm, representing a 1.6-fold improvement over the native sensor pixel size (2.20 μm). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for dynamic measurements was demonstrated through real-time observations of paramecia. With its mechanical-free operation, high-throughput capability, and high-resolution imaging, this system-combining ETL and computational SR technology-holds significant potential for a wide range of applications in biological imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Despite good axial resolution in holographic microscopy, lateral resolution remains constrained by optical limitations, pixel size, and noise. These restrictions hinder accurate reconstruction of fine structural and phase details. To address this, we evaluate three deep-learning super-resolution models (RCAN, SwinIR, and a conditional diffusion network) on 1,440 off-axis digital holograms of microbeads downsampled by 2 ×, 3 ×, and 4 ×. We compare their performance to bicubic spline interpolation using PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and phase-derived depth errors. RCAN and SwinIR yield the most accurate reconstructions, preserving structural and quantitative phase information, and offering guidance on model selection for phase-focused holography.

ABSTRACT:
Optical waveguides are transforming total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy by providing a larger field of view and a robust, compact, and less complex platform, which is essential for high-throughput and long-term imaging. While several methods have been explored to enhance resolution, the entropy-based super-resolution imaging (ESI) method remains underutilized despite its significant potential to improve image quality through computational means without requiring specialized hardware. In addition to limited use in the literature, existing implementations of ESI, particularly in available plugins, have notable shortcomings. These limitations often result in inaccurate conclusions, undermining the reliability and effectiveness of the technique. In this work, we first implemented our ESI algorithm and conducted simulations under various imaging conditions to identify its limitations and evaluate its suitability for TIRF microscopy. We then fabricated silicon nitride optical waveguides, coated them with TetraSpeck microspheres, and applied our ESI algorithm to analyze the experimental data. Comparative analysis with existing algorithms revealed that initial experiments using available plugins did not yield resolution enhancements and resulted in inaccurate emitter distance measurements. In contrast, our ESI algorithm effectively addressed these shortcomings, achieving resolution improvements consistent with theoretical predictions.

ABSTRACT:
Tight junctions seal the paracellular space between epithelial cells, with their claudin (CLDN) composition dictating epithelial permeability properties. In kidney thick ascending limbs, calcium is reabsorbed paracellularly through a meshwork of CLDN16 and CLDN19 polymers. CLDN14 is strongly upregulated by high blood calcium, restricts this paracellular calcium flux, and is linked to kidney stone disease. How CLDN14 controls paracellular calcium flux and structurally incorporates into this complex junction is unknown. Using confocal and super-resolution microscopy, we show that CLDN14 preferentially associates with CLDN19, thereby gradually replacing CLDN16 in the CLDN19 copolymer in vitro and in mice in vivo. The claudin switch depends on CLDN14 polymerization and occurs on a timescale of days via a pathway independent of dynamin-mediated endocytosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism of tight junction regulation, demonstrating how dynamic claudin remodeling within this complex structure controls renal calcium excretion and contributes to kidney stone pathogenesis.

ABSTRACT:
We report the direct generation of wavelength-versatile Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes with positive and negative topological charge at cyan (490 nm), green (523 nm), orange (605 nm), red (637 nm), and deep red (697 nm) wavelengths from a diode pumped Pr3+-doped water-proof fluoro-aluminate glass (Pr3+: WPFG) fiber laser. Key to effective wavelength selection and optimization was the inclusion and axial displacement of an intra-cavity lens which induces strong chromatic aberration. We anticipate that this ultra-compact, visible LG mode fiber laser source will facilitate new methodologies and techniques in super-resolution fluorescent microscopy and laser nano/micro-fabrication.

DOI: 10.1364/OE.560595

ABSTRACT:
The paired generation of vortices and antivortices is studied across multiple fields, including magnetic materials and Bose-Einstein condensates. In optics, while optical vortex-antivortex pairs have been realized in free space, those in evanescent fields were unaddressed. Recent research has shown that the formation mechanism of newly discovered topological quasi-particles, like photonic skyrmions, is closely related to the existence of vortices and antivortices in evanescent fields. Here, we demonstrate, what we believe is for the first time, the diffraction-limit-free vortex-antivortex pair of Poynting vector in evanescent fields. It is found that the separation between the vortex and antivortex can be adjusted through the spiral phase of the incident field, and this separation is not constrained by the diffraction limit. This work provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of the topological quasi-particles, as well as in developing applications in super-resolution microscopy and precision metrology.

ABSTRACT:
Microsphere-assisted microscopy (MAM) is a label-free super-resolution imaging technique based on traditional optical microscopy, but the current research usually chooses reflected illumination (RI). In this work, the effects of microsphere size, refractive index, and immersion environment on the imaging properties of MAM in imaging a 300-nm-period grating sample under transmitted illumination (TI) are systematically investigated. The experimental results reveal that under TI, microspheres with a smaller size exhibit higher resolution, and microspheres with a higher refractive index show higher magnification in imaging. Under three immersion conditions (in the air, partial immersion, and full immersion in an SU-8 film), lower refractive index SiO2 microspheres (partial immersion) and higher refractive index BaTiO3 glass microspheres (full immersion) can obtain higher contrast and resolution in imaging. Despite the difference in illumination modes, the imaging properties of MAM under TI and RI are similar. Specifically, the relative refractive index between the microsphere and the surrounding environment affects the magnification, while the contrast is strongly influenced by the interfacial reflection and the relative refractive index between the microsphere and the surrounding medium. The magnification and resolution of MAM are also related to photonic nanojet (PNJ) of the microsphere. When the full width at half-maximum of the PNJ is narrow and the PNJ is close to the surface of the microsphere, it is beneficial for improving resolution. Our findings can help to reveal the underlying mechanisms of MAM and promote its practical applications.

ABSTRACT:
The glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), composed of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs), the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and podocytes, serves as a highly selective interface regulating fluid and solute exchange between blood and urine. This review synthesizes current understanding of the anatomy, developmental biology, and molecular signaling pathways that govern the structure and function of each GFB component. Key regulators such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nephrin, integrins, and laminins are discussed in the context of barrier formation, maintenance, and injury response. Advanced imaging methods including electron microscopy, intravital microscopy, and super-resolution techniques are reviewed for their roles in characterizing nanoscale GFB architecture. To bridge glomerular biology with engineering applications, we critically evaluate how these insights inform the design of bioinspired hemodialysis (HD) membranes. Strategies such as endothelialization, extracellular matrix (ECM) coatings, and triculture systems are explored, alongside recent developments in glomerular-inspired membranes and organ-on-chip models. We also address the practical challenges of translating these biological features into scalable, hemocompatible dialysis technologies. By integrating advances in cell biology, materials science, and microfluidic modeling, this review provides a framework for the development of next-generation dialysis membranes that more closely replicate native kidney filtration.

ABSTRACT:
Pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure, developing due to the vascular endothelium dysfunction, are common side effects of anticancer therapy. This study is the first approach to create an in vitro model system to estimate vascular response at the drug development/improvement stage and to determine whether it is possible to select an antitumor drug dose effectively suppressing malignant cells without a pathological effect on the endothelial cells function. In this study (1) the doses of several clinically used antitumor drugs suppressing the common tumor cell proliferation were determined experimentally; (2) the endothelial cell viability after exposure to selected doses of these drugs was assessed in vitro; (3) changes in the endothelial monolayer condition, as well as cultured endothelial cell reactions and intracellular disorders accompanying the effects of selected drugs doses were studied in vitro using the intravital observations and super-resolution microscopy methods. This approach allowed to select antitumor drug concentrations inhibiting cell proliferation in selected tumor lines, but having no critical effect on the viability of endothelial cells and their cytoskeletal structures. As the result, an in vitro model system for studying the side effects of medications on vascular permeability was created.

ABSTRACT:
Microgels are versatile materials with applications across biomedicine, materials science, and beyond. Their controllable size and composition enables tailoring specific properties, yet characterizing their internal structures on the nanoscale remains challenging. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRFM) effectively analyzes sub-μm structures, including microgels, offering a tool for investigating more complex systems such as core-shell microgels. Understanding their internal structure, in particular interpenetration at the soft-soft interface between core and shell and accessibility for guest molecules, is vital for rationally designing predictable functionalities. This study examines the core-shell morphology and the accessibility for guest molecules of bio-hybrid DNA-poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) microgels at three stages of shell polymerization using SRFM. Covalent fluorescence labeling probes the core polymer, co-polymerized with N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystamine, which provides visual insight into core and shell compartmentalization. The results demonstrate core polymer interpenetration into the shell without compromising its original structure, and additionally allow us to determine the size- and hydrophobicity dependent accessibility of the microgel core. This, offering new perspectives on the internal architecture of core-shell microgels, contributes to the in-depth understanding of their complex behavior, potentially guiding the rational design of new microgel drug delivery systems, taking into account the complex interplay of polarity, size and charge of guest molecules.

ABSTRACT:
Anaesthetics temporarily inhibit neural activity by acting on voltage-gated sodium channels and GABA receptors. Although their neurological mechanisms are well-defined, their wider cellular effects, especially in non-neuronal systems, are inadequately understood. This study utilized Solanum lycopersicum plant's root apex cells as a transparent model to examine anaesthetic-induced subcellular alterations via live-cell fluorescence imaging, immunostaining, and super-resolution microscopy. These findings demonstrate the hierarchical cascade of organelle dysfunction, such as mitochondria, lysosomes, vesicle trafficking, and nuclear architectures under anaesthesia in plants. The nucleus is identified as the main controller of recovery potential and cellular fate. In a time dependent experiment, it is found that plant cells exposed to lidocaine for up to 4 h can still recover mitochondrial potential, lysosomal function, and nuclear integrity when anaesthesia is removed. However, beyond 4 h the damage, especially to the nucleus, is irreversible, and cells proceeded to cell death. The data further demonstrate that organelles can recover after brief exposure, but prolonged exposure stops recovery, resulting in the irreversible degradation of the nucleus leading to complete cell death. The results may help to uncover organelle-related dysfunction under anaesthetic toxicity and provide a clearer understanding for minimizing or reversing such damage.

ABSTRACT:
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can signal from intracellular compartments but the occurrence and relevance of this phenomenon for metabolite-sensing GPCRs is largely unknown. Here, we investigate free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4), a metabolite-sensing GPCR activated by medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids. Using live-cell imaging, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, super-resolution microscopy and cell fractionation, we show that FFA4 localizes to intracellular membranes, particularly endoplasmic reticulum subdomains surrounding lipid droplets, in both immortalized adipocytes and mouse adipose tissue. Upon lipolysis, locally released fatty acids appear to rapidly activate this intracellular FFA4 pool, leading to Gi/o protein signaling and preferential reduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels near lipid droplets. These mechanisms are required for efficient FFA4-mediated lipolysis regulation, as shown using tethered mini-Gαi/o proteins to locally inhibit Gi/o signaling. These findings reveal an unexpected 'intracrine' GPCR signaling modality involved in the local regulation of cell metabolism, with biological and pharmacological implications.

ABSTRACT:
Nucleosomes constitute the primary unit of eukaryotic chromatin and have been the focus of numerous informative single-molecule investigations regarding their biophysical properties and interactions with chromatin-binding proteins. Nucleosome reconstitution on DNA for these studies typically involves a salt dialysis procedure that provides precise control over the placement and number of nucleosomes formed along a DNA tether. However, this protocol is time-consuming and requires a substantial amount of DNA and histone octamers as inputs. To offer an alternative strategy, an in situ nucleosome reconstitution method for single-molecule force and fluorescence microscopy that utilizes the histone chaperone Nap1 is described. This method enables users to assemble nucleosomes on any DNA template without the need for strong nucleosome positioning sequences, adjust nucleosome density on demand, and use fewer reagents. In situ nucleosome formation occurs within seconds, offering a simpler experimental workflow and a convenient transition into single-molecule measurements. Examples of two downstream assays for probing nucleosome mechanics and visualizing the behavior of individual proteins on chromatin are further described.

TITLE: Two-Photon Microscopy for the Study of Tendons.
AUTHORS: Villaseñor Steffany, Grinstein Mor
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2024)
PMID: 38619235
DOI: 10.3791/65853

ABSTRACT:
Two-photon microscopy has emerged as a potent tool for evaluating deep tissue cells and characterizing the alignment of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in various biological systems. This technique relies on nonlinear light-matter interactions to detect two distinct signals: the second harmonic generated (SHG) diffusion signal, which facilitates the visualization of collagen fibers and their orientation, and the near-infrared excitation signal for imaging ultraviolet excited autofluorescence. SHG imaging proves especially effective in visualizing collagen fibers due to the non-centrosymmetric crystalline structure of fibrillar collagen I. Given that tendons are matrix-rich tissues with a limited number of cells, their high collagen content makes them ideal candidates for analysis using two-photon microscopy. Consequently, two-photon microscopy offers a valuable means to analyze and characterize collagen abnormalities in tendons. Its application extends to studying tendon development, injuries, healing, and aging, enabling the comprehensive characterization of tendon cells and their interactions with the ECM under various conditions using two-photon microscopy tools. This protocol outlines the use of two-photon microscopy in tendon biology and presents an adapted methodology to achieve effective imaging and characterization of tendon cells during development and after injury. The method allows the utilization of thin microscopic sections to create a comprehensive image of the ECM within tendons and the cells that interact with this matrix. Most notably, the article showcases a technique to generate 3D images using two-photon microscopy in animal models.

ABSTRACT:
With the advancement of multi-photon microscopy and molecular technologies, fluorescence imaging is rapidly growing to become a powerful approach for studying the structure, function, and plasticity of living brain tissues. In comparison to conventional electrophysiology, fluorescence microscopy can capture the neural activity as well as the morphology of the cells, enabling long-term recordings of the identified neuron populations at single-cell or subcellular resolution. However, high-resolution imaging typically requires a stable, head-fixed setup that restricts the movement of the animal, and the preparation of a flat surface of transparent glass allows visualization of neurons at one or more horizontal planes but is limited in studying the vertical processes running across different depths. Here, we describe a procedure to combine a head plate fixation and a microprism that gives multilayer and multimodal imaging. This surgical preparation not only gives access to the entire column of the mouse visual cortex but allows two-photon imaging in a head-fixed position and one-photon imaging in a freely moving paradigm. Using this approach, one can sample identified cell populations across different cortical layers, register their responses under head-fixed and freely moving states, and track the long-term changes over months. Thus, this method provides a comprehensive assay of the microcircuits, enabling direct comparison of neural activities evoked by well-controlled stimuli and under a natural behavioral paradigm.

TITLE: High-Speed Atomic Force Microscopy Imaging of DNA Three-Point-Star Motif Self Assembly Using Photothermal Off-Resonance Tapping.

ABSTRACT:
High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) is a popular molecular imaging technique for visualizing single-molecule biological processes in real-time due to its ability to image under physiological conditions in liquid environments. The photothermal off-resonance tapping (PORT) mode uses a drive laser to oscillate the cantilever in a controlled manner. This direct cantilever actuation is effective in the MHz range. Combined with operating the feedback loop on the time domain force curve rather than the resonant amplitude, PORT enables high-speed imaging at up to ten frames per second with direct control over tip-sample forces. PORT has been shown to enable imaging of delicate assembly dynamics and precise monitoring of patterns formed by biomolecules. Thus far, the technique has been used for a variety of dynamic in vitro studies, including the DNA 3-point-star motif assembly patterns shown in this work. Through a series of experiments, this protocol systematically identifies the optimal imaging parameter settings and ultimate limits of the HS-PORT AFM imaging system and how they affect biomolecular assembly processes. Additionally, it investigates potential undesired thermal effects induced by the drive laser on the sample and surrounding liquid, particularly when the scanning is limited to small areas. These findings provide valuable insights that will drive the advancement of PORT mode's application in studying complex biological systems.

ABSTRACT:
The dynamic nature of retinal cellular processes necessitates advancements in gene delivery and live monitoring techniques to enhance the understanding and treatment of ocular diseases. This study introduces an optimized adeno-associated virus (AAV) approach, utilizing specific serotypes and promoters to achieve optimal transfection efficiency in targeted retinal cells, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and Müller glia. Leveraging the precision of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO), this work presents a non-invasive method for in vivo imaging that captures the longitudinal expression of AAV-mediated green fluorescent protein (GFP). This approach eliminates the need for terminal procedures, preserving the continuity of observation and the well-being of the subject. Furthermore, the GFP signal can be traced in AAV-infected RGCs along the visual pathway to the superior colliculus (SC) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), enabling the potential for direct visual pathway mapping. These findings provide a detailed protocol and demonstrate the application of this powerful tool for real-time studies of retinal cell behavior, disease pathogenesis, and the efficacy of gene therapy interventions, offering valuable insights into the living retina and its connections.

ABSTRACT:
Antibiotics are currently the most used antibacterial treatment for killing bacteria. However, bacteria develop resistance when continually overexposed to antibiotics. Developing antimicrobial agents that can replace existing antibiotics is essential because antibiotic-resistant bacteria have resistance mechanisms for all current antibiotics and can promote nosocomial infections. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose graphene oxide/copper (GO/Cu) nanocomposites as antibacterial materials that can replace the existing antibiotics. GO/Cu nanocomposites are characterized by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. They show that copper (Cu) nanoparticles are well-grown on the graphene oxide sheets. Additionally, a microdilution broth method is used to confirm the efficacy of the antimicrobial substance against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), which are frequently implicated in nosocomial infections. Specifically, 99.8% of MRSA and 84.7% of P. aeruginosa are eliminated by 500 µg/mL of GO/Cu nanocomposites. Metal nanocomposites can eradicate antibiotic-resistant bacteria by releasing ions, forming reactive oxygen species, and physically damaging the bacteria. This study demonstrates the potential of antibacterial GO/Cu nanocomposites in eradicating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

ABSTRACT:
Vascular organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) recapitulate the cell type diversity and complex architecture of human vascular networks. This three-dimensional (3D) model holds substantial potential for vascular pathology modeling and in vitro drug screening. Despite recent advances, a key technical challenge remains in reproducibly generating organoids with consistent quality, which is crucial for downstream assays and applications. Here, a modified protocol is presented that improves both the homogeneity and reproducibility of vascular organoid generation. The modified protocol incorporates the use of microwells and the CEPT cocktail (chroman 1, emricasan, polyamines, and the integrated stress response inhibitor, trans-ISRIB) to improve embryoid body formation and cell survival. Differentiated, mature vascular organoids generated using this protocol are characterized by whole-mount 3D immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze their morphology and complex vasculature. This protocol enables the production of high-quality vascular organoids in a scalable manner, potentially facilitating their use in disease modeling and drug screening applications.

ABSTRACT:
Biomedical studies of the liver in mammals are hindered by the lack of methods for in vivo noninvasive longitudinal imaging at cellular resolution. Until now, optical imaging of the liver in situ is possible by intravital imaging, which offers high-resolution imaging at the cellular level but cannot be performed multiple times and, therefore, longitudinally in the same animal. Noninvasive imaging methods, such as bioluminescence, allow repeated imaging sessions on the same animal but do not achieve cell resolution. To address this methodology gap, we have developed a platform for noninvasive in vivo imaging of liver spheroids engrafted in the anterior chamber of the mouse eye. In the workflow described in this study, primary mouse liver spheroids are generated in vitro and transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eye of recipient mice, where they engraft on the iris. The cornea acts as a natural body window through which we can image the engrafted spheroids by conventional confocal microscopy. The spheroids survive for months in the eye, during which the cells can be studied in contexts of health and disease, as well as being monitored in response to different stimuli over repeated imaging sessions using appropriate fluorescent probes. In this protocol, we provide a breakdown of the necessary steps to implement this imaging system and explain how to best harness its potential.

ABSTRACT:
Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), performing numerous functions that support neuronal health and CNS homeostasis. They are a major population of immune cells associated with CNS disease activity, adopting reactive phenotypes that potentially contribute to neuronal injury during chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The distinct mechanisms by which microglia regulate neuronal function and survival during health and disease remain limited due to challenges in resolving the complex in vivo interactions between microglia, neurons, and other CNS environmental factors. Thus, the in vitro approach of co-culturing microglia and neurons remains a valuable tool for studying microglia-neuronal interactions. Here, we present a protocol to generate and co-culture primary microglia and neurons from mice. Specifically, microglia were isolated after 9-10 days in vitro from a mixed glia culture established from brain homogenates derived from neonatal mice between post-natal days 0-2. Neuronal cells were isolated from brain cortices of mouse embryos between embryonic days 16-18. After 4-5 days in vitro, neuronal cells were seeded in 96-well plates, followed by the addition of microglia to form the co-culture. Careful timing is critical for this protocol as both cell types need to reach experimental maturity to establish the co-culture. Overall, this co-culture can be useful for studying microglia-neuron interactions and can provide multiple readouts, including immunofluorescence microscopy, live imaging, as well as RNA and protein assays.

ABSTRACT:
Effective live-imaging techniques are crucial to assess neuronal morphology in order to measure neurite outgrowth in real time. The proper measurement of neurite outgrowth has been a long-standing challenge over the years in the neuroscience research field. This parameter serves as a cornerstone in numerous in vitro experimental setups, ranging from dissociated cultures and organotypic cultures to cell lines. By quantifying the neurite length, it is possible to determine if a specific treatment worked or if axonal regeneration is enhanced in different experimental groups. In this study, the aim is to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the Incucyte Neurotrack neurite outgrowth analysis software. This semi-automatic software is available in a time-lapse microscopy system which offers several advantages over commonly used methodologies in the quantification of the neurite length in phase contrast images. The algorithm masks and quantifies several parameters in each image and returns neuronal cell metrics, including neurite length, branch points, cell-body clusters, and cell-body cluster areas. Firstly, we validated the robustness and accuracy of the software by correlating its values with those of the manual NeuronJ, a Fiji plug-in. Secondly, we used the algorithm which is able to work both on phase contrast images as well as on immunocytochemistry images. Using specific neuronal markers, we validated the feasibility of the fluorescence-based neurite outgrowth analysis on sensory neurons in vitro cultures. Additionally, this software can measure neurite length across various seeding conditions, ranging from individual cells to complex neuronal nets. In conclusion, the software provides an innovative and time-effective platform for neurite outgrowth assays, paving the way for faster and more reliable quantifications.

ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma, IDH-wild type, CNS WHO grade 4 (GBM) is a primary brain tumor associated with poor patient survival despite aggressive treatment. Developing realistic ex vivo models remain challenging. Patient-derived 3-dimensional organoid (PDO) models offer innovative platforms that capture the phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity of GBM, while preserving key characteristics of the original tumors. However, manual dissection for PDO generation is time-consuming, expensive and can result in a number of irregular and unevenly sized PDOs. This study presents an innovative method for PDO production using an automated tissue chopper. Tumor samples from four GBM and one astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade 2 patients were processed manually as well as using the tissue chopper. In the manual approach, the tumor material was dissected using scalpels under microscopic control, while the tissue chopper was employed at three different angles. Following culture on an orbital shaker at 37 °C, morphological changes were evaluated using bright field microscopy, while proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (CC3) were assessed by immunofluorescence after 6 weeks. The tissue chopper method reduced almost 70% of the manufacturing time and resulted in a significantly higher PDOs mean count compared to the manually processed tissue from the second week onwards (week 2: 801 vs. 601, P = 0.018; week 3: 1105 vs. 771, P = 0.032; and week 4:1195 vs. 784, P < 0.01). Quality assessment revealed similar rates of tumor-cell apoptosis and proliferation for both manufacturing methods. Therefore, the automated tissue chopper method offers a more efficient approach in terms of time and PDO yield. This method holds promise for drug- or immunotherapy-screening of GBM patients.

ABSTRACT:
Optical imaging technologies and cell targeting have played a major role in detecting and treating diseases such as cancer. Bioharmonophores are optical imaging nanoprobes composed of biodegradable polymer-encapsulated, self-assembling triphenylalanine peptides. They produce a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) signal, a non-linear optical process in which two photons directed at a non-centrosymmetric medium combine to form a new photon with twice the energy. Bioharmonophores demonstrate superior optical properties compared to fluorescent probes and, unlike previously developed inorganic SHG nanoprobes, are both biocompatible and biodegradable. Here, we present a protocol providing five detailed procedures that describe (1) synthesis of bioharmonophores; (2) embedding and imaging of the synthesized SHG nanoprobes in polyacrylamide gel; (3) functionalization of bioharmonophores with thiol-containing polyethyleneglycol; (4) subsequent click chemistry to target cancer cells; and (5) imaging of functionalized bioharmonophores endocytosed by cancer cells using two-photon microscopy. Bioharmonophores hold great potential as clinical contrast agents due to their optical features and could be used in the future as an innovative approach to cancer treatment using targeted high-resolution optical imaging. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT:
Expansion Microscopy (ExM) is a widely used super-resolution technique that enables imaging of structures beyond the diffraction limit of light. However, ExM suffers from weak labeling signals and expansion distortions, limiting its applicability. Here, we present an innovative approach called Tetrahedral DNA nanostructure Expansion Microscopy (TDN-ExM), addressing these limitations by using tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) for fluorescence labeling. Our approach demonstrates a 3- to 10-fold signal amplification due to the multivertex nature of TDNs, allowing the modification of multiple dyes. Previous studies have confirmed minimal distortion on a large scale, and our strategy can reduce the distortion at the ultrastructural level in samples because it does not rely on anchoring agents and is not affected by digestion. This results in a brighter fluorescence, better uniformity, and compatibility with different labeling strategies and optical super-resolution technologies. We validated the utility of TDN-ExM by imaging various biological structures with improved resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios.

ABSTRACT:
Molecular mobility is an important measure in biological functionality, as molecules have to diffuse to meet and interact and perform actions. Measurement of mobility requires specific tools such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Especially, combination with superresolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED-FCS), whether in a point- or beam-scanning mode, has proven valuable for determination of anomalous diffusion. STED-FCS however relies on an accurate calibration of the effective observation spot formed for different laser powers of the additional STED laser. This poster article highlights the need for calibration measurements and outlines that rather simple procedures involving acetone cover-glass surface cleaning only, instead of piranha cover-glass surface cleaning, and point instead of more complex scanning STED-FCS are sufficient for calibration.

Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy has attracted great research attention due to its applications to breaking diffraction limits for imaging and lithography. However, its implementation based on single-mode fibers often encounters challenges such as complex structural integration, costly fabrication processes, and the need for specific fiber designs. Herein, a low-cost bi-order Bessel beam based on one single-mode fiber integrated with a structurally simple wavelength-scale microstructure (WSM) on fiber end was proposed for STED system. Through simulation study for full-scale WSM optimization, we have successfully developed a bicolor laser beam (BLB) consisting of a zero-order Bessel beam at a wavelength of 405 nm and a donuts high-order Bessel beam at a wavelength of 532 nm. This fiber-based configuration allows us to achieve a diffraction-limited spot size with a working distance of 0.67λpump and a minimum FWHM of 0.395λpump. By combining wavelength division multiplexing technology with power modulation of the donuts beam, this work provides a promising way for achieving super-resolution imaging or lithography with only one single-mode fiber.

ABSTRACT:
The integration of biocatalysts within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is attracting growing interest due to its potential to both enhance biocatalyst stability and sustain biocatalyst activity in organic solvents. However, the factors that facilitate the post-synthetic infiltration of such large molecules into MOF pores remain unclear. This systematic study enabled the identification of the influence of biocatalyst molecular size, molecular weight and affinity on the uptake by an archetypal MOF, NU-1000. We analyzed a range of six biocatalysts with molecular weights from 1.9 kDa to 44.4 kDa, respectively. By employing a combination of fluorescence tagging and 3D-STED confocal laser scanning microscopy, we distinguished between biocatalysts that were internalized within the MOF pores and those sterically excluded. The catalytic functions of the biocatalysts hosted within the MOF were investigated and found to show strong variations relative to the solvated case, ranging from a two-fold increase to a strong decrease.

ABSTRACT:
Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is extensively utilized in the fields of cell and molecular biology as a super-resolution imaging technique for visualizing cells and molecules. Nonetheless, the imaging process of STORM is frequently susceptible to noise, which can significantly impact the subsequent image analysis. Moreover, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive automated processing approach for analyzing protein aggregation states from a large number of STORM images. This paper initially applies our previously proposed denoising algorithm, UNet-Att, in STORM image denoising. This algorithm was constructed based on attention mechanism and multi-scale features, showcasing a remarkably efficient performance in denoising. Subsequently, we propose a collection of automated image processing algorithms for the ultimate feature extractions and data analyses of the STORM images. The information extraction workflow effectively integrates automated methods of image denoising, objective image segmentation and binarization, and object information extraction, and a novel image information clustering algorithm specifically developed for the morphological analysis of the objects in the STORM images. This automated workflow significantly improves the efficiency of the effective data analysis for large-scale original STORM images.

ABSTRACT:
Correlative imaging of fluorescence microscopy and soft X-ray microscopy plays a crucial role in exploring the relationship between structure and function in cellular biology. However, the current correlative imaging methods are limited either to off-line or low-resolution fluorescence imaging. In this study, we developed an integrated on-line cryogenic photoactivated localization microscopy (cryo-PALM) system at a soft X-ray microscopy station. This design eliminates some critical issues such as sample damage and complex post-correlation arising from transferring samples between different cryostages. Furthermore, we successfully achieved correlative imaging of cryopreserved near-native cells, with a resolution of about 50 nm of cryo-PALM. Therefore, the developed on-line correlation imaging platform provides a powerful tool for investigating the intricate relationship between structure and function in biological and molecular interactions, as well as in other life science disciplines.

ABSTRACT:
Allagoptera campestris is an acaulescent, rhizomatous palm tree that occurs in grassland and savanna areas (Cerrado). In the Santa Bárbara Ecological Station (Águas de Santa Bárbara, São Paulo, Brazil) the species is found growing in three distinct conditions: 1) in the understory of Pinus species plantations introduced in the 1970s in formerly open savanna, 2) in an area where Pinus species cultivated in the 1970s were later removed and the remaining material burned, and 3) in an open, undisturbed savanna area without the interference of pines. Anatomical studies carried out with A. campestris leaves collected in the same three areas indicated leaf plasticity in response to growth conditions. To verify whether there are differences in vessel element morphology in belowground organs, light, and scanning electron microscopy analyses were conducted on portions just below the crown, in the middle of the rhizome, and the median portions of three longer adventitious roots sampled from three plants in each area. The study reveals significant variations in vessel element characteristics of A. campestris, with roots consistently displaying longer and larger elements than rhizomes, and environmental conditions, especially in pine understory, influence vessel dimensions, and hydraulic conductivity in a negative manner.

ABSTRACT:
Millimeter-scale slide optical waveguides (OWGs) show the potential to break the barrier of easy-to-use and versatility for total internal reflection (TIR) fluorescence technology. In this paper, multi-frequency structured illumination (SI) patterns resulting from the evanescent field (EF) on the surface of a millimeter-scale polymer slide OWG are observed by measuring the fluorescence intensity distribution of fluorescent dyes deposited on the top of the OWG. The frequency, intensity, and stability of the SI patterns show a strong dependence on the coupling angle of the incident light (changing with the incident position). The distribution of multi-frequency SI patterns in the frequency space is demonstrated for different numerical aperture (NA) imaging systems (NA = 0.3, 0.6, and 0.8), indicating the potential for enhanced resolution for low NA systems with a simple and cheap polymer slide.

ABSTRACT:
Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a powerful super-resolution technology in biological science because of its fast imaging speed, low phototoxicity, and full-field imaging. Despite this, SIM is hampered by out-of-focus background noise, which can obscure weak fluorescence signals and render them unrecognizable. Previous denoising algorithms tended to eliminate the noise along with the weak signals, causing a decrease in image quality. To address this issue, we propose a denoising algorithm based on out-of-focus plane information extraction (OPIE-SIM) that salvages the weak signal from the out-of-focus background noise. The OPIE-SIM algorithm enhances weak fluorescence signals by combining out-of-focus layer information with focal plane data and correcting the differences in point spread functions (PSF). This approach eliminates out-of-focus background noise and preserves the integrity of weak fluorescence structures while significantly reducing image acquisition time compared to traditional over-focusing imaging techniques. Through extensive simulations and experiments, we verified the feasibility of our approach. Compared with other denoising algorithms, our method generates images with a higher signal-to-noise ratio while maintaining the integrity of weak fluorescence structures.

TITLE: Markov chain models of emitter activations in single molecule localization microscopy.
AUTHORS: Sun Yi
JOURNAL: Optics express (2024)
PMID: 39573070
DOI: 10.1364/OE.530359

ABSTRACT:
A well-reasoned model of data movie in single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is desired. A model of data movie can be decomposed into a model of emitter activation process and a model of data frame. In this paper, we focus on Markov chain modeling and analyzing of emitter activation process for both cycled and continuous illuminations. First, a two-phase Markov chain is proposed to model the activation process for a pair of conjugated activator and emitter with cycled illumination. By converting the frame-based Markov chain into several cycle-based Markov chains, the stationary state distribution in the photoactivatable period is derived. Further obtained are several formulas that capture the characterization of the two-phase Markov chain. Second, the Markov chain and analytical result are extended to the continuous illumination where an emitter is excited continuously in all frames. Finally, incorporating the model of emitter activation process with our previous model of data frame, the model of data movie for both cycled and continuous illuminations in 3D and 2D imaging are simulated by custom codes. It is shown that the model can synthesize data movies well and the analytical formulas predict the simulation results accurately. The models provide a means to be broadly utilized in generating well-reasoned data movies for training of neural networks and evaluation of localization algorithms.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence imaging plays a pivotal role in the study of biological processes, and cell-permeable fluorogenic dyes are crucial to visualize intracellular structures with high specificity. Polymethine dyes are vitally important fluorophores in single-molecule localization microscopy and in vivo imaging, but their use in live cells has been limited by high background fluorescence and low membrane permeability. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of fluorogenic polymethine dyes via intramolecular cyclization. Finally, we offer an outlook on the prospects of fluorogenic polymethine dyes for bioimaging.

ABSTRACT:
The 3D location of light emitters provides essential information in many biological, chemical and physical systems. 4Pi single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) being one of the state-of-the-art techniques provides exceptional precision in the axial direction; however, the lateral precision degrades significantly when the emitter is displaced several wavelengths away from the mutual focal plane. Here we propose a hybrid system employing type-B 4Pi microscope and engineered point-spread function (PSF), the resultant interferometric PSF is optimized against the Cramer-Rao metric, yielding the richest information regarding the emitter's 3D locations. It outperforms conventional 4Pi SMLM with a larger axial range and compares advantageously to the non-interferometric PSFs with doubled photon efficiency and better precision in all directions.

ABSTRACT:
Nanomedicine is a field at the intersection of nanotechnology and medicine, promising due to its potential to revolutionize healthcare. Despite its long trajectory, there is still a long road ahead for its full development, and smart design of nanomedicines is still a challenge. Among other problems, this is due to the scarcity of tools available for the precise visualization and comprehension of nano-bio interactions, impeding progress towards the clinical phase. One of the developed tools that stands out to be a strong nanoscopy technique for studying nano-delivery systems within cellular environments is expansion microscopy (ExM). This technique was used for tissue and cell expansion and most recently for lipid molecule expansion inside cells. Herein, we present for the first time polyplex expansion microscopy (PExM); a comprehensive examination of ExM as an already developed technique, but adapted for expanding polymer based nanocarriers, in particular polyplexes within cells, allowing the analysis of their trafficking. With our method set up, PExM will be extensively used for the study of polyplex nanoparticle cell trafficking, becoming a high-resolution technique which can also be applied to primary amine containing polymeric nanoparticles without requiring expensive super-resolution microscopes.

ABSTRACT:
In this study, we propose a pioneering spatially frequency-shifted super-resolution microscopy technique that utilizes the synergy of quasiperiodic gratings and deep learning. First, a quasiperiodic grating capable of converting evanescent waves into propagating waves is designed. The grating is positioned between the object under investigation and the objective lens, and the high-frequency information carried by the evanescent waves in the near-field region of the object is shifted into the detection window and becomes accessible in the far field for imaging. Subsequently, we provide two deep learning models for image and video reconstructions to achieve the reconstruction of static and dynamic samples respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the high feasibility of the proposed method, and both static and dynamic objects with sub-wavelength features can be resolved. The developed method paves the way to the realization of super-resolution imaging by using a traditional bright-field microscope without the need for an extensive optical system design.

ABSTRACT:
In this Letter, we propose a new, to the best of our knowledge, lensless on-chip holographic microscopy platform, which can acquire sub-pixel-shifting holograms through centimeter (cm)-level lateral translations. An LED light source is used to illuminate the sample, and two orthogonally tilted step-structure glass plates are inserted into the optical path. By merely displacing the glass plates under cm-level precision, a series of holograms with sub-pixel displacements can be obtained. Combined with our improved pixel super-resolution (PSR) algorithm, high-quality PSR phase imaging can be achieved. Tests on the high-resolution USAF1951 target demonstrate that the system can achieve a half-width resolution of 870 nm by a camera with a pixel size of 1.67 µm. Additionally, imaging experiments were conducted on phase-type sinusoidal gratings, yeasts, red blood cells, and lilium ovary sections, respectively. The results show that the system can achieve large field-of-view, high-resolution phase imaging under low-cost hardware conditions and holds promise for its applications in biology and medicine.

ABSTRACT:
Imaging flow cytometry, which combines the advantages of flow cytometry and microscopy, has emerged as a powerful tool for cell analysis in various biomedical fields such as cancer detection. In this study, we develop multiplex imaging flow cytometry (mIFC) by employing a spatial wavelength division multiplexing technique. Our mIFC can simultaneously obtain brightfield and multi-color fluorescence images of individual cells in flow, which are excited by a metal halide lamp and measured by a single detector. Statistical analysis results of multiplex imaging experiments with resolution test lens, magnification test lens, and fluorescent microspheres validate the operation of the mIFC with good imaging channel consistency and micron-scale differentiation capabilities. A deep learning method is designed for multiplex image processing that consists of three deep learning networks (U-net, very deep super resolution, and visual geometry group 19). It is demonstrated that the cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24) imaging channel is more sensitive than the brightfield, nucleus, or cancer antigen 125 (CA125) imaging channel in classifying the three types of ovarian cell lines (IOSE80 normal cell, A2780, and OVCAR3 cancer cells). An average accuracy rate of 97.1% is achieved for the classification of these three types of cells by deep learning analysis when all four imaging channels are considered. Our single-detector mIFC is promising for the development of future imaging flow cytometers and for the automatic single-cell analysis with deep learning in various biomedical fields.

ABSTRACT:
The nanoscale imaging of biological specimens can improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis. In recent years, expansion microscopy (ExM) has been demonstrated to be an effective and low-cost alternative to optical super-resolution microscopy. However, it has been limited by the need for specific and often custom anchoring agents to retain different biomolecule classes within the gel and by difficulties with expanding standard clinical sample formats, such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, especially if larger expansion factors or preserved protein epitopes are desired. Here, we describe Magnify, a new ExM method for robust expansion up to 11-fold in a wide array of tissue types. By using methacrolein as the chemical anchor between the tissue and gel, Magnify retains multiple biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, within the gel, thus allowing the broad nanoscale imaging of tissues on conventional optical microscopes. This protocol describes best practices to ensure robust and crack-free tissue expansion, as well as tips for handling and imaging highly expanded gels.

ABSTRACT:
The mitochondrion is an organelle that can be elongated, fragmented, and renovated according to the metabolic requirements of the cells. The remodeling of the mitochondrial network allows healthy mitochondria to meet cellular demands; however, the loss of this capacity has been related to the development or progression of different pathologies. In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial density and distribution changes are observed in physiological and pathological conditions such as exercise, aging, and obesity, among others. Therefore, the study of the mitochondrial network may provide a better understanding of mechanisms related to those conditions. Here, a protocol for mitochondria imaging of live-skeletal muscle fibers from rats is described. Fibers are manually dissected in a relaxing solution and incubated with a fluorescent live-cell imaging indicator of mitochondria (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester, TMRE). The mitochondria signal is recorded by confocal microscopy using the XYZ scan mode to obtain confocal images of the intermyofibrillar mitochondrial (IMF) network. After that, the confocal images are processed by thresholding and binarization. The binarized confocal image accounts for the positive pixels for mitochondria, which are then counted to obtain the mitochondrial density. The mitochondrial network in skeletal muscle is characterized by a high density of IMF population, which has a periodic longitudinal distribution similar to that of T-tubules (TT). The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a standard analysis technique performed to evaluate the distribution of TT that allows finding the distribution frequency and the level of their organization. In this protocol, the implementation of the FFT algorithm is described for the analysis of the longitudinal mitochondrial distribution in skeletal muscle.

PMID: 37747220

ABSTRACT:
Compared to its one-photon counterpart, two-photon excitation is beneficial for bioimaging experiments because of its lower phototoxicity, deeper tissue penetration, efficient operation in densely packed systems, and reduced angular photoselection of fluorophores. Thus, the introduction of polarization analysis in two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) provides a more precise determination of molecular organization in a sample compared to standard imaging methods based on linear optical processes. In this work, we focus on polarization-sensitive 2PFM (ps-2PFM) and its application in the determination of molecular ordering within complex bio-structures-amyloid spherulites. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's are often diagnosed through the detection of amyloids-protein aggregates formed due to an impaired protein misfolding process. Exploring their structure leads to a better understanding of their creation pathway and consequently, to developing more sensitive diagnostic methods. This paper presents the ps-2PFM adapted for the determination of local fibril ordering inside the bovine insulin spherulites and spherical amyloidogenic protein aggregates. Moreover, we prove that the proposed technique can resolve the three-dimensional organization of fibrils inside the spherulite.

ABSTRACT:
The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has emerged as a valuable model system in the field of neuroscience. The application of confocal microscopy at the Drosophila NMJ enables researchers to acquire synaptic information, encompassing both quantitative data on synapse abundance and detailed insights into their morphology. However, the diffuse distribution and limited visual range of the TEM present challenges for the ultrastructural analysis. This study introduces an innovative and efficient sample preparation method that surpasses the conventional approach. The procedure begins by placing a metal mesh at the base of a flat-bottomed bottle or test tube, followed by positioning fixed larvae samples onto the mesh. An additional mesh is placed over the samples, ensuring that they are positioned between the two meshes. The fixed samples are thoroughly dehydrated and infiltrated before proceeding with the embedding procedure. Then embedding of the samples in epoxy resin is performed in a flat sheet manner, which allows for the preparation of muscles for positioning and sectioning. Benefiting from these steps, all the muscles of Drosophila larvae can be visualized under light microscopy, therey facilitating subsequent positioning and sectioning. Excess resin is removed after locating the 6th and 7th muscles of body segments A2 and A3. Serial ultra-thin sectioning of the 6th or 7th muscle is performed.

ABSTRACT:
With the ever-increasing use of Li-ion batteries, especially due to their adoption in electric vehicles, their safety is in prime focus. Thus, the all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) that use solid electrolytes instead of liquid electrolytes, which reduce the risk of flammability, have been the center stage of battery research for the last few years. However, in the ASSB, the ion transportation through the solid-solid electrolyte-electrode interface poses a challenge due to contact and chemical/electrochemical stability issues. Applying a suitable coating around the electrode and/or electrolyte particles offers a convenient solution, leading to better performance. For this, researchers are screening potential electronic/ionic conductive and nonconductive coatings to find the best coatings with suitable thickness for long-term chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical stability. Operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM) couples high spatial resolution with high temporal resolution to allow visualization of dynamic processes, and thus is an ideal tool to evaluate electrode/electrolyte coatings via studying (de)lithiation at a single particle level in real-time. However, the accumulated electron dose during a typical high-resolution in situ work may affect the electrochemical pathways, evaluation of which can be time-consuming. The current protocol presents an alternative procedure in which the potential coatings are applied on Si nanoparticles and are subjected to (de)lithiation during operando TEM experiments. The high volume changes of Si nanoparticles during (de)lithiation allow monitoring of the coating behavior at a relatively low magnification. Thus, the whole process is very electron-dose efficient and offers quick screening of potential coatings.

TITLE: 3-D Time-Lapse Imaging of Cell Wall Dynamics Using Calcofluor in the Moss Physcomitrium patens.

PMID: 36847393

ABSTRACT:
Time-lapse imaging with fluorescence microscopy allows observation of the dynamic changes of growth and development at cellular and subcellular levels. In general, for observations over a long period, the technique requires transformation of a fluorescent protein; however, for most systems, genetic transformation is either time-consuming or technically unavailable. This manuscript presents a protocol for 3-D time-lapse imaging of cell wall dynamics over a 3 day period using calcofluor dye (which stains cellulose in the plant cell wall), developed in the moss Physcomitrium patens. The calcofluor dye signal from the cell wall is stable and can last for 1 week without obvious decay. Using this method, it has been shown that the detachment of cells in ggb mutants (in which the protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I beta subunit is knocked out) is caused by unregulated cell expansion and cell wall integrity defects. Moreover, the patterns of calcofluor staining change over time; less intensely stained regions correlate with the future cell expansion/branching sites in the wild type. This method can be applied to many other systems that contain cell walls and that can be stained by calcofluor.

ABSTRACT:
Antibiotic persistence refers to the capacity of small bacterial subpopulations to transiently tolerate high doses of bactericidal antibiotics. Upon bactericidal antibiotic treatment, the bulk of the bacterial population is rapidly killed. This first rapid phase of killing is followed by a substantial decrease in the rate of killing as the persister cells remain viable. Classically, persistence is determined at the population level by time/kill assays performed with high doses of antibiotics and for defined exposure times. While this method provides information about the level of persister cells and the killing kinetics, it fails to reflect the intrinsic cell-to-cell heterogeneity underlying the persistence phenomenon. The protocol described here combines classical time/kill assays with single-cell analysis using real-time fluorescence microscopy. By using appropriate fluorescent reporters, the microscopy imaging of live cells can provide information regarding the effects of the antibiotic on cellular processes, such as chromosome replication and segregation, cell elongation, and cell division. Combining population and single-cell analysis allows for the molecular and cellular characterization of the persistence phenotype.

ABSTRACT:
Nanoemulsion adjuvant vaccines have attracted extensive attention because of their small particle size, high thermal stability, and ability to induce validly immune responses. However, establishing a series of comprehensive protocols to evaluate the immune response of a novel nanoemulsion adjuvant vaccine is vital. Therefore, this article features a rigorous procedure to determine the physicochemical characteristics of a vaccine (by transmission electron microscopy [TEM], atomic force microscopy [AFM], and dynamic light scattering [DLS]), the stability of the vaccine antigen and system (by a high-speed centrifuge test, a thermodynamic stability test, SDS-PAGE, and western blot), and the specific immune response (IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b). Using this approach, researchers can evaluate accurately the protective effect of a novel nanoemulsion adjuvant vaccine in a lethal MRSA252 mouse model. With these protocols, the most promising nanoemulsion vaccine adjuvant in terms of effective adjuvant potential can be identified. In addition, the methods can help optimize novel vaccines for future development.

ABSTRACT:
Nanomaterial exposure can cause replication stress and genomic instability in cells. The degree of instability depends on the chemistry, size, and concentration of the nanomaterials, the time of exposure, and the exposed cell type. Several established methods have been used to elucidate how endogenous/exogenous agents impact global replication. However, replicon-level assays, such as the DNA fiber assay, are imperative to understand how these agents influence replication initiation, terminations, and replication fork progression. Knowing this allows one to understand better how nanomaterials increase the chances of mutation fixation and genomic instability. We used RAW 264.7 macrophages as model cells to study the replication dynamics under graphene oxide nanoparticle exposure. Here, we demonstrate the basic protocol for the DNA fiber assay, which includes pulse labeling with nucleotide analogs, cell lysis, spreading the pulse-labeled DNA fibers onto slides, fluorescent immunostaining of the nucleotide analogs within the DNA fibers, imaging of the replication intermediates within the DNA fibers using confocal microscopy, and replication intermediate analysis utilizing a computer-assisted scoring and analysis (CASA) software.

AUTHORS: Kim Joo-Sung, Lim Jihoon
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2023)
PMID: 37677005
DOI: 10.3791/65517

ABSTRACT:
Acinetobacter causes nosocomial infections and its biofilm formation can contribute to the survival on dry surfaces such as hospital environments. Thus, biofilm quantification and visualization are important methods to assess the potential of Acinetobacter strains to cause nosocomial infections. The biofilms forming on the surface of the microplate can be quantified in terms of volume and cell numbers. Biofilm volumes can be quantified by staining using crystal violet, washing, destaining using ethanol, then measuring the solubilized dye using a microplate reader. To quantify the number of cells embedded in the biofilms, the biofilms are scrapped off using cell scrapers, harvested in the saline, vigorously agitated in the presence of glass beads, and spread on Acinetobacter agar. Then, the plates are incubated at 30 °C for 24-42 h. After incubation, the red colonies are enumerated to estimate the number of cells in biofilms. This viable count method can also be useful for counting Acinetobacter cells in mixed-species biofilms. Acinetobacter biofilms can be visualized using fluorescent dyes. A commercially available microplate designed for microscopic analysis is employed to form biofilms. Then, the bottom-surface attached biofilms are stained with SYTO9 and propidium iodide dyes, washed, then visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Parasites generally have a negative effect on the health of their host. They represent a huge health burden, as they globally affect the health of the infested human or animal in the long term and, thus, impact agricultural and socio-economic outcomes. However, parasite-driven immune-regulatory effects have been described, with potential therapeutic relevance for autoimmune diseases. While the metabolism in both the host and parasites contributes to their defense and is the basis for nematode survival in the intestine, it has remained largely understudied due to a lack of adequate technologies. We have developed and applied NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging to explanted murine intestinal tissue during infection with the natural nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus to study the metabolic processes in both the host and parasites in a spatially resolved manner. The exploitation of the fluorescence lifetime of the co-enzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), hereafter NAD(P)H, which are preserved across species, depends on their binding status and the binding site on the enzymes catalyzing metabolic processes. Focusing on the most abundantly expressed NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes, the metabolic pathways associated with anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation/aerobic glycolysis, and NOX-based oxidative burst, as a major defense mechanism, were distinguished, and the metabolic crosstalk between the host and parasite during infection was characterized.

AUTHORS: Saito Takumi, Deguchi Shinji
JOURNAL: Current protocols (2023)
PMID: 36689324
DOI: 10.1002/cpz1.655

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is widely used to evaluate intracellular molecular turnover or repeated translocation of molecules using confocal laser scanning microscopy. While numerous models have been developed for the analysis of FRAP responses, in which chemical interactions and/or fast diffusion processes are involved, it is inherently difficult to evaluate the long-term behavior of molecular turnover because of the presence of intracellular flow and microscopic deformation of bleached regions. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a novel continuum mechanics-based FRAP (CM-FRAP) approach that enables simultaneous evaluation of long-term molecular turnover and intracellular flow/deformation. Here we demonstrate the utility of CM-FRAP by using actin molecules associated with stress fibers in rat aortic smooth muscle cells with clarification of the experimental setup and data analysis. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Human fertility is declining in Western countries, and it is becoming increasingly clear that male infertility plays a pivotal role in the overall fertility decline. To understand the process that drives successful male germ cell maturation, the study of spermatogenesis of model organisms, such as mice, is essential. Residual bodies (RBs) play an important role in the last stages of spermatogenesis. They are formed at the time when post-meiotic spermatids undergo sequential differentiation steps so that the acrosome and flagellum are developed, the nucleus is markedly condensed, and the cytoplasm is lost. The masses of lost cytoplasm become RBs. Our recent work has shown that RB dynamics are highly sensitive to even small fertility defects. It was also noted that the transcriptome and proteome of RBs changes in response to spermatogenic defects. Thus, RBs represent an excellent and highly sensitive entity for studying male fertility. Previously published protocols for RB purification had some major limitations: they produced an RB fraction that was heavily contaminated with spermatozoa and erythrocytes or required tens of grams of starting material. In addition, most of the available protocols were developed for purification of RBs from rat testes. Here, we present a protocol that allows the isolation of 2.5-3 × 106 RBs from mouse testes with a purity of 98% from only 1 g of starting material. The purified material can be used for various downstream applications to study male fertility, such as transcriptome and proteome analyses, super-resolution microscopy, and electron and cryo-electron microscopy, amongst many others. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT:
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) hold tremendous potential for cardiovascular disease modeling, drug screening, personalized medicine, and pathophysiology studies. The availability of a robust protocol and functional assay for studying phenotypic behavior of hiPSC-CMs is essential for establishing an in vitro disease model. Many heart diseases manifest due to changes in the mechanical strain of cardiac tissue. Therefore, non-invasive evaluation of the contractility properties of hiPSC-CMs remains crucial to gain an insight into the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases. Speckle tracking-based strain analysis is an efficient non-invasive method that uses video microscopy and image analysis of beating hiPSC-CMs for quantitative evaluation of mechanical contractility properties. This article presents step-by-step protocols for extracting quantitative contractility properties of an hiPSC-CM system obtained from five members of a family, of whom three were affected by DiGeorge syndrome, using speckle tracking-based strain analysis. The hiPSCs from the family members were differentiated and purified into hiPSC-CMs using metabolic selection. Time-lapse images of hiPSC-CMs were acquired using high-spatial-resolution and high-time-resolution phase-contrast video microscopy. Speckled images were characterized by evaluating the cross-correlation coefficient, speckle size, speckle contrast, and speckle quality of the images. The optimum parameters of the speckle tracking algorithm were determined by performing sensitivity analysis concerning computation time, effective mapping area, average contraction velocity, and strain. Furthermore, the hiPSC-CM response to adrenaline was evaluated to validate the sensitivity of the strain analysis algorithm. Then, we applied speckle tracking-based strain analysis to characterize the dynamic behavior of patient-specific hiPSC-CMs from the family members affected/unaffected by DiGeorge syndrome. Here, we report an efficient and manipulation-free method to analyze the contraction displacement vector and velocity field, contraction-relaxation strain rate, and contractile cycles. Implementation of this method allows for quantitative analysis of the contractile phenotype characteristics of hiPSC-CMs to distinguish possible cardiac manifestation of DiGeorge syndrome. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TITLE: Edge effect of wide spectrum denoising in super-resolution microscopy.
AUTHORS: Cheng Tao, Wang Yingshan
JOURNAL: Microscopy (Oxford, England) (2023)
PMID: 36744613
DOI: 10.1093/jmicro/dfad012

ABSTRACT:
During the stochastic optical reconstruction microscope (STORM) raw image acquisition in super-resolution microscopy, noise is inevitable. Noise not only reduces the temporal and spatial resolution of the super-resolution image but also leads to the failure of super-resolution image reconstruction. Wide spectrum denoising (WSD) can effectively remove various random noises (such as Poisson noise and Gaussian noise) from the STORM raw image to improve the super-resolution image reconstruction. We found that there is an obvious edge effect in WSD, and its influence on STORM raw image denoising and super-resolution image reconstruction is studied. We then proposed the method of restraining edge effect. The simulation and real experiment results show that edge trimming can effectively suppress the edge effect, thus leading to better super-resolution image reconstruction.

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) reconstruction algorithm that allows the reconstruction of super-resolved images with 2N + 1 raw intensity images, with N being the number of structured illumination directions used. The intensity images are recorded after using a 2D grating for the projection fringe and a spatial light modulator to select two orthogonal fringe orientations and perform phase shifting. Super-resolution images can be reconstructed from the five intensity images, enhancing the imaging speed and reducing the photobleaching by 17%, compared to conventional two-direction and three-step phase-shifting SIM. We believe the proposed technique will be further developed and widely applied in many fields.

ABSTRACT:
Objective. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is widely used in various fields of life science research. In clinical practice, it has low phototoxicity, fast imaging speed and no special fluorescent markers. However, SIM is still affected by the scattering medium of biological tissues, resulting in insufficient resolution of the obtained images, which limits the development of life sciences. A novel multi-frame wavelet generation adversarial network (MWGAN) is proposed to improve the scattering reconstruction capability of SIM.Approach. MWGAN is based on two components derived from the original image. A generative adversarial network constructed by wavelet transform is trained to reconstruct some complex details in the cell structure. Multi-frame adversarial network is used to obtain the inter-frame information of the image and use the complementary information of the before and after frames to improve the quality of the model reconstruction.Results. To demonstrate the robustness of MWGAN, multiple low-quality SIM image datasets are tested. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves superior performance in both of the subjective and objective evaluation.Conclusion. MWGAN is effective for improving the clarity of SIM images. Meanwhile, the SIM images reconstructed by multiple frames improve the reconstruction quality of complex regions and allow clearer and dynamic observation of cellular functions.

ABSTRACT:
Due to the huge demand for higher resolution and stable imaging from fluorescent labeling biological systems and life systems, there has been much research and development of structured light illumination imaging (SIM). Despite this, further investigating the possible applications of SIM in other fields is still meaningful. In this paper, super-resolution observation of non-fluorescent samples by a SIM system under reflective illumination is analyzed. The simulation of SIM imaging and image reconstruction is carried out by using an open-source program, and the influences of the structural parameters of the illumination light (fringe direction, phase, and intensity uniformity of the cosine structured light), the optical parameters of the imaging system (selection of the optical transfer function) and the anti-vibration characteristics of the platform on the super-resolution imaging effect are studied. Finally, by optimizing the above influential factors according to simulation results, successful application of SIM in laser processing process monitoring is demonstrated in the experiment. We believe that our research results will provide some reference for the application of SIM in other similar scenarios.

TITLE: Single-molecule localization microscopy based on denoising, interpolation and local maxima.
AUTHORS: Cheng Tao
JOURNAL: Microscopy (Oxford, England) (2023)
PMID: 36412750
DOI: 10.1093/jmicro/dfac065

ABSTRACT:
A single fluorescent molecule is highly likely to be located at the center pixel position of a raw image diffused spot in an ideal situation. Even if the molecule and the center pixel position do not completely overlap, they are very close. A single-molecule localization method based on denoising, interpolation and local maxima (DIL) is proposed. The low-resolution raw image is denoised and interpolated, and a new image with a pixel size equal to that of the super-resolution image is attained. The local maxima of the new image are extracted. With this method, it is found that the local maxima positions can be regarded as the fluorescent molecule positions. Simulation results demonstrate that the DIL single-molecule localization accuracy reaches ∼18 nm when the Gaussian noise variance is equal to 0.01. Experimental results demonstrate that the DIL localization methodology is comparable to the Gaussian fitting algorithm and is faster.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule localization microscopy has enabled scientists to visualize cellular structures at the nanometer scale. However, researchers are facing great challenges in analyzing images presented by point clouds. Existing algorithms for cluster identification are coordinate-based analyses requiring users to input cutoff thresholds based on the distance or density of the point cloud. These thresholds are often one's best guess with repeated visual inspections, making the cluster assignment user-dependent. Here, we present a cluster identification algorithm mimicking the modulation transfer function of human vision. This approach does not require any input parameters and produces visually satisfactory cluster assignments. We tested this algorithm by identifying the clusters of the fusion proteins of the Nipah virus on its host cells. This algorithm was further extended to analyze three-dimensional point clouds using virus-like particles as an example.

PMID: 36264216

ABSTRACT:
The three-dimensional (3D) inter-site distance can be measured by single-molecule localization microscopy. Existing theories and analysis tools for 3D inter-site distance measurement only consider the simplest case where all measured distances are from an identical 3D Rician distribution. There are many problems where the 3D inter-site distance measurement result is made up of multiple components, for example, the measurement of intramolecular distances of deoxyribonucleic acid with multiple possible conformations. In these cases, the overall distance distributions become finite mixtures of 3D Rician distributions (or 3D Rician mixtures). Here, we provide a numerical method using the 3D Rician mixture model to resolve the finite 3D inter-site distance mixtures, which is based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. The proposed method has been tested on simulation data of finite 3D inter-site distance mixtures. The result using the Gaussian mixture model in the developed method is also discussed for comparison.

ABSTRACT:
We developed the new IR super-resolution microscope by using a 4-wave mixing (4-wave), which is a third-order nonlinear optical process, and carried out the IR super-resolution imaging of the cross section of the rachis of an avian feather. We clearly observed strong signals in the entire region of the rachis at the amide I vibration of β-keratin in both of the XXYY and YYXX polarization combination. These results are different from images detected by using the vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) method. While the VSFG imaging detects molecules only from the interface, the 4-wave method enables us to observe the signal from the bulk area. We concluded that the four repeating units of β-keratins in the bulk area which are suggested by X-ray diffraction studies are visualized in the 4-wave detected method. We also applied two IR super-resolution microscopies for the barb and discuss the site dependence of the orientation, distribution and concentration of β-keratin.

ABSTRACT:
This study constructed a nano-drug delivery system, A3@GMH, by co-delivering the stapled anoplin peptide(Ano-3, A3) with the light-harvesting material graphene oxide(GO), and evaluated its oncolytic immunotherapy effect on triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC). A3@GMH was prepared using an emulsion template method and its physicochemical properties were characterized. The in vivo and in vitro photothermal conversion abilities of A3@GMH were investigated using an infrared thermal imager. The oncoly-tic activity of A3@GMH against TNBC 4T1 cells was evaluated through cell counting kit-8(CCK-8), lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) release, live/dead cell staining, and super-resolution microscopy. The targeting properties of A3@GMH on 4T1 cells were assessed using a high-content imaging system and flow cytometry. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the antitumor mechanism of A3@GMH in combination with photothermal therapy(PTT) through inducing immunogenic cell death(ICD) in 4T1 cells. The results showed that the prepared A3@GMH exhibited distinct mesoporous and coated structures with an average particle size of(308.9±7.5) nm and a surface potential of(-6.79±0.58) mV. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of A3 were 23.9%±0.6% and 20.5%±0.5%, respectively. A3@GMH demonstrated excellent photothermal conversion ability and biological safety. A3@GMH actively mediated oncolytic features such as 4T1 cell lysis and LDH release, as well as ICD effects, and showed enhanced in vitro antitumor activity when combined with PTT. In vivo, A3@GMH efficiently induced ICD effects with two rounds of PTT, activated the host&apos;s antitumor immune response, and effectively suppressed tumor growth in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, achieving an 88.9% tumor inhibition rate with no apparent toxic side effects. This study suggests that the combination of stapled anoplin peptide and PTT significantly enhances the oncolytic immunotherapy for TNBC and provides a basis for the innovative application of anti-tumor peptides derived from TCM in TNBC treatment.

TITLE: Using 2-Photon Microscopy to Quantify the Effects of Chronic Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction on Glomerular Processes.

ABSTRACT:
Applying novel microscopy methods to suitable animal disease models to explore the dynamic physiology of the kidney remains a challenge. Rats with surface glomeruli provide a unique opportunity to investigate physiological and pathophysiological processes using intravital 2-photon microscopy. Quantification of glomerular capillary blood flow and vasoconstriction and dilatation in response to drugs, permeability, and inflammation are just some of the processes that can be studied. In addition, transgenic rats, i.e., podocytes labeled with fluorescent dyes and other molecular biomarker approaches, provide increased resolution to directly monitor and quantify protein-protein interactions and the effects of specific molecular alterations. In mice, which lack surface glomeruli after four weeks of age, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) for several weeks has been used to induce surface glomeruli. As this induction model does not allow for baseline studies, we quantified the effects of UUO on glomerular processes in the UUO model in Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rats, which have surface glomeruli under physiologic conditions. The UUO model for five weeks or more induced significant alterations to gross renal morphology, the peritubular and glomerular microvasculature, as well as the structure and function of tubular epithelia. Glomerular and peritubular red blood cell (RBC) flow decreased significantly (p < 0.01), probably due to the significant increase in the adherence of white blood cells (WBCs) within glomerular and peritubular capillaries. The glomerular sieving coefficient of albumin increased from 0.015 ± 0.002 in untreated MWFs to 0.045 ± 0.05 in 5-week-old UUO MWF rats. Twelve weeks of UUO resulted in further increases in surface glomerular density and glomerular sieving coefficient (GSC) for albumin. Fluorescent albumin filtered across the glomeruli was not reabsorbed by the proximal tubules. These data suggest that using UUO to induce surface glomeruli limits the ability to study and interpret normal glomerular processes and disease alterations.

ABSTRACT:
Physical and chemical processes at solid-liquid interfaces play a crucial role in many natural and technological phenomena, including catalysis, solar energy and fuel generation, and electrochemical energy storage. Nanoscale characterization of such interfaces has recently been achieved using cryogenic electron microscopy, thereby providing a new path to advancing our fundamental understanding of interface processes. This contribution provides a practical guide to mapping the structure and chemistry of solid-liquid interfaces in materials and devices using an integrated cryogenic electron microscopy approach. In this approach, we pair cryogenic sample preparation which allows stabilization of solid-liquid interfaces with cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling to create cross-sections through these complex buried structures. Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) techniques performed in a dual-beam FIB/SEM enable direct imaging as well as chemical mapping at the nanoscale. We discuss practical challenges, strategies to overcome them, as well as protocols for obtaining optimal results. While we focus in our discussion on interfaces in energy storage devices, the methods outlined are broadly applicable to a range of fields where solid-liquid interface play a key role.

ABSTRACT:
Septins are a family of conserved eukaryotic GTP-binding proteins that can form cytoskeletal filaments and higher-order structures from hetero-oligomeric complexes. They interact with other cytoskeletal components and the cell membrane to participate in important cellular functions such as migration and cell division. Due to the complexity of septins' many interactions, the large number of septin genes (13 in humans), and the ability of septins to form hetero-oligomeric complexes with different subunit compositions, cell-free reconstitution is a vital strategy to understand the basics of septin biology. The present paper first describes a method to purify recombinant septins in their hetero-oligomeric form using a two-step affinity chromatography approach. Then, the process of quality control used to check for the purity and integrity of the septin complexes is detailed. This process combines native and denaturing gel electrophoresis, negative stain electron microscopy, and interferometric scattering microscopy. Finally, a description of the process to check for the polymerization ability of septin complexes using negative stain electron microscopy and fluorescent microscopy is given. This demonstrates that it is possible to produce high-quality human septin hexamers and octamers containing different isoforms of septin_9, as well as Drosophila septin hexamers.

TITLE: DetectSyn: A Rapid, Unbiased Fluorescent Method to Detect Changes in Synapse Density.

PMID: 35867038

ABSTRACT:
Synapses are the site of communication between neurons. Neuronal circuit strength is related to synaptic density, and the breakdown of synapses is characteristic of disease states like major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease. Traditional techniques to investigate synapse numbers include genetic expression of fluorescent markers (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP)), dyes that fill a neuron (e.g., carbocyanine dye, DiI), and immunofluorescent detection of spine markers (e.g., postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95)). A major caveat to these proxy techniques is that they only identify postsynaptic changes. Yet, a synapse is a connection between a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic spine. The gold standard for measuring synapse formation/elimination requires time-consuming electron microscopy or array tomography techniques. These techniques require specialized training and costly equipment. Further, only a limited number of neurons can be assessed and are used to represent changes to an entire brain region. DetectSyn is a rapid fluorescent technique that identifies changes to synapse formation or elimination due to a disease state or drug activity. DetectSyn utilizes a rapid proximity ligation assay to detect juxtaposed pre- and postsynaptic proteins and standard fluorescent microscopy, a technique readily available to most laboratories. Fluorescent detection of the resulting puncta allows for quick and unbiased analysis of experiments. DetectSyn provides more representative results than electron microscopy because larger areas can be analyzed than a limited number of fluorescent neurons. Moreover, DetectSyn works for in vitro cultured neurons and fixed tissue slices. Finally, a method is provided to analyze the data collected from this technique. Overall, DetectSyn offers a procedure for detecting relative changes in synapse density across treatments or disease states and is more accessible than traditional techniques.

ABSTRACT:
Transfection with a fluorescently labeled marker protein of interest in combination with time-lapse video microscopy is a classic method of studying the dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton. This protocol offers a technique for human primary fibroblast transfection, which can be difficult because of the specifics of primary cell cultivation conditions. Additionally, cytoskeleton dynamic property maintenance requires a low level of transfection to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio without causing microtubule stabilization. It is important to take measures to protect the cells from light-induced stress and fluorescent dye fading. In the course of our work, we tested different transfection methods and protocols as well as different vectors to select the best combination of conditions suitable for human primary fibroblast studies. We analyzed the resulting time-lapse videos and calculated microtubule dynamics using ImageJ. The dynamics of microtubules' plus-ends in the different cell parts are not similar, so we divided the analysis into subgroups - the centrosome region, the lamella, and the tail of fibroblasts. Notably, this protocol can be used for in vitro analysis of cytoskeleton dynamics in patient samples, enabling the next step towards understanding the dynamics of the various disease development.

ABSTRACT:
The cytoskeleton is responsible for major internal organization and re-organization within the cell, all without a manager to direct the changes. This is especially the case during mitosis or meiosis, where the microtubules form the spindle during cell division. The spindle is the machinery used to segregate genetic material during cell division. Toward creating self-organized spindles in vitro, we recently developed a technique to reconstitute microtubules into spindle-like assemblies with a minimal set of microtubule-associated proteins and crowding agents. Specifically, MAP65 was used, which is an antiparallel microtubule crosslinker from plants, a homolog of Ase1 from yeast and PRC1 from mammalian organisms. This crosslinker self-organizes microtubules into long, thin, spindle-like microtubule self-organized assemblies. These assemblies are also similar to liquid crystal tactoids, and microtubules could be used as mesoscale mesogens. Here, protocols are presented for creating these microtubule tactoids, as well as for characterizing the shape of the assemblies using fluorescence microscopy and the mobility of the constituents using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.

ABSTRACT:
In the current study, graphene and its derivatives have been investigated and used for many applications, including electronics, sensing, energy storage, and photocatalysis. Synthesis and fabrication of high quality, good uniformity, and low defects graphene are critical for high-performance and highly sensitive devices. Among many synthesis methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), considered a leading approach to manufacture graphene, can control the number of graphene layers and yield high-quality graphene. CVD graphene needs to be transferred from the metal substrates on which it is grown onto insulating substrates for practical applications. However, separation and transferring of graphene onto new substrates are challenging for a uniform layer without damaging or affecting graphene's structures and properties. Additionally, electrolyte-gated graphene field-effect transistor (EGGFET) has been demonstrated for its wide applications in various biomolecular detections because of its high sensitivity and standard device configuration. In this article, poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-assisted graphene transferring approach, fabrication of graphene field-effect transistor (GFET), and biomarker immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection are demonstrated. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy were applied to characterize the transferred graphene. The method is shown to be a practical approach for transferring clean and residue-free graphene while preserving the underlying graphene lattice onto an insulating substrate for electronics or biosensing applications.

ABSTRACT:
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) di/oligomerization has revealed potential mechanisms for receptors diversification of signal selectivity, specificity, and amplitude. The use of super-resolution imaging techniques to investigate these di/oligomer molecular complexities have undoubtably provided insight to the dynamics of complexes formed at the plasma membrane. Here we describe the methodology of photoactivatable dye localization microscopy (PD-PALM) to study the spatial organization of GPCR homomers at the plasma membrane.

ABSTRACT:
Chromatin organization influences gene and transposon expression, and regulates various cellular processes. Higher order chromatin structure has been widely studied using genomic approaches and microscopy image analyses. Chromosome conformation capture and sequencing the junction of DNA fragments enables the study of both chromatin interaction and chromosome folding. However, certain cell types are embedded in other cell types which complicate the process of studying them using high-throughput genomic approaches. To overcome this limitation, high-resolution microscopy techniques are now available to investigate chromatin organization in single cells. In this chapter, we provide a detailed protocol to prepare chromosome spreading from tomato nuclei, to label genomic loci by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and to visualize these locations at high resolution with Structured Illumination microscopy.

PMID: 34570098
DOI: 10.3791/62789

ABSTRACT:
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a complex macromolecular structure comprised of multiple copies of ~30 different nucleoporin proteins (Nups). Collectively, these Nups function to regulate genome organization, gene expression, and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT). Recently, defects in NCT and alterations to specific Nups have been identified as early and prominent pathologies in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's Disease (AD)/Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Huntington's Disease (HD). Advances in both light and electron microscopy allow for a thorough examination of sub-cellular structures, including the NPC and its Nup constituents, with increased precision and resolution. Of the commonly used techniques, super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) affords the unparalleled opportunity to study the localization and expression of individual Nups using conventional antibody-based labeling strategies. Isolation of nuclei prior to SIM enables the visualization of individual Nup proteins within the NPC and nucleoplasm in fully and accurately reconstructed 3D space. This protocol describes a procedure for nuclei isolation and SIM to evaluate Nup expression and distribution in human iPSC-derived CNS cells and postmortem tissues.

ABSTRACT:
The protocol developed here offers a tool to enable computer tracking of Escherichia coli division and fluorescent levels over several hours. The process starts by screening for colonies that survive on minimal media, assuming that only Escherichia coli harboring the correct plasmid will be able to thrive in the specific conditions. Since the process of building large genetic circuits, requiring the assembly of many DNA parts, is challenging, circuit components are often distributed between multiple plasmids at different copy numbers requiring the use of several antibiotics. Mutations in the plasmid can destroy transcription of the antibiotic resistance genes and interject with resources management in the cell leading to necrosis. The selected colony is set on a glass-bottom Petri dish and a few focus planes are selected for microscopy tracking in both bright field and fluorescent domains. The protocol maintains the image focus for more than 12 hours under initial conditions that cannot be regulated, creating a few difficulties. For example, dead cells start to accumulate in the lenses' field of focus after a few hours of imaging, which causes toxins to buildup and the signal to blur and decay. Depletion of nutrients introduces new metabolic processes and hinder the desired response of the circuit. The experiment's temperature lowers the effectivity of inducers and antibiotics, which can further damage the reliability of the signal. The minimal media gel shrinks and dries, and as a result the optical focus changes over time. We developed this method to overcome these challenges in Escherichia coli, similar to previous works developing analogous methods for other micro-organisms. In addition, this method offers an algorithm to quantify the total stochastic noise in unaltered and altered cells, finding that the results are consistent with flow analyzer predictions as shown by a similar coefficient of variation (CV).

ABSTRACT:
On-surface synthesis has recently been regarded as a promising approach for the generation of new molecular structures. It has been particularly successful in the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons, nanographenes and intrinsically reactive and instable, yet attractive species. It is based on the combination of solution chemistry aimed at preparation of appropriate molecular precursors for further ultra-high vacuum surface assisted transformations. This approach also owes its success to an incredible development of characterization techniques, such as scanning tunneling/atomic force microscopy and related methods, which allow detailed, local characterization at atomic scale. While the surface-assisted synthesis can provide molecular nanostructures with outstanding precision, down to single atoms, it suffers from basing on metallic surfaces and often limited yield. Therefore, the extension of the approach away from metals and the struggle to increase productivity seem to be significant challenges toward wider applications. Herein, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis approach for generation of non-planar nanographenes, which are synthesized through a combination of solution chemistry and sequential surface-assisted processes, together with the detailed characterization by scanning probe microscopy methods.

ABSTRACT:
The underlying causes of heart valve related-disease (HVD) are elusive. Murine animal models provide an excellent tool for studying HVD, however, the surgical and instrumental expertise required to accurately quantify the structure and organization across multiple length scales have stunted its advancement. This work provides a detailed description of the murine dissection, en bloc staining, sample processing, and correlative imaging procedures for depicting the heart valve at different length scales. Hydrostatic transvalvular pressure was used to control the temporal heterogeneity by chemically fixing the heart valve conformation. Micro-computed tomography (µCT) was used to confirm the geometry of the heart valve and provide a reference for the downstream sample processing needed for the serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). High-resolution serial SEM images of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were taken and reconstructed to provide a local 3D representation of its organization. µCT and SBF-SEM imaging methods were then correlated to overcome the spatial variation across the pulmonary valve. Though the work presented is exclusively on the pulmonary valve, this methodology could be adopted for describing the hierarchical organization in biological systems and is pivotal for the structural characterization across multiple length scales.

ABSTRACT:
Most plant viruses in nature are transmitted from one plant to another by hemipteran insects. A high population density of the vector insects that are highly efficient at virus transmission plays a key role in virus epidemics in fields. Studying virus-insect vector interactions can advance our understanding of virus transmission and epidemics with the aim of designing novel strategies to control plant viruses and their vector insects. Immunofluorescence labeling has been widely used to analyze interactions between pathogens and hosts and is used here in the white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera), which efficiently transmits the southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV, genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae), to locate the virions and insect proteins in the midgut epithelial cells. Using laser scanning confocal microscopy, we studied the morphological characteristics of midgut epithelial cells, cellular localization of insect proteins, and the colocalization of virions and an insect protein. This protocol can be used to study virus activities in insects, functions of insect proteins, and interactions between virus and vector insect.

DOI: 10.3791/62758

ABSTRACT:
Sensitized emission-based Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments are easily done but depend on the microscopic setup. Confocal laser scanning microscopes have become a workhorse for biologists. Commercial systems offer high flexibility in laser power adjustment and detector sensitivity and often combine different detectors to obtain the perfect image. However, the comparison of intensity-based data from different experiments and setups is often impossible due to this flexibility. Biologist-friendly procedures are of advantage and allow for simple and reliable adjustment of laser and detector settings. Furthermore, as FRET experiments in living cells are affected by the variability in protein expression and donor-acceptor ratios, protein expression levels must be considered for data evaluation. Described here is a simple protocol for reliable and reproducible FRET measurements, including routines for the estimation of protein expression and adjustment of laser intensity and detector settings. Data evaluation will be performed by calibration with a fluorophore fusion of known FRET efficiency. To improve simplicity, correction factors have been compared that have been obtained in cells and by measuring recombinant fluorescent proteins.

ABSTRACT:
Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is the radiationless transfer of energy from an excited donor to an acceptor molecule and depends upon the distance and orientation of the molecules as well as the extent of overlap between the donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra. FRET permits to study the interaction of proteins in the living cell over time and in different subcellular compartments. Different intensity-based algorithms to measure FRET using microscopy have been described in the literature. Here, a protocol and an algorithm are provided to quantify FRET efficiency based on measuring both the sensitized emission of the acceptor and quenching of the donor molecule. The quantification of ratiometric FRET in the living cell not only requires the determination of the crosstalk (spectral spill-over, or bleed-through) of the fluorescent proteins but also the detection efficiency of the microscopic setup. The protocol provided here details how to assess these critical parameters.

TITLE: Fast Grid Preparation for Time-Resolved Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
The field of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is rapidly developing with new hardware and processing algorithms, producing higher resolution structures and information on more challenging systems. Sample preparation for cryo-EM is undergoing a similar revolution with new approaches being developed to supersede the traditional blotting systems. These include the use of piezo-electric dispensers, pin printing and direct spraying. As a result of these developments, the speed of grid preparation is going from seconds to milliseconds, providing new opportunities, especially in the field of time-resolved cryo-EM where proteins and substrates can be rapidly mixed before plunge freezing, trapping short lived intermediate states. Here we describe, in detail, a standard protocol for making grids on our in-house time-resolved EM device both for standard fast grid preparation and also for time-resolved experiments. The protocol requires a minimum of about 50 µL sample at concentrations of ≥ 2 mg/mL for the preparation of 4 grids. The delay between sample application and freezing can be as low as 10 ms. One limitation is increased ice thickness at faster speeds and compared to the blotting method. We hope this protocol will aid others in designing their own grid making devices and those interested in designing time-resolved experiments.

TITLE: Multiphoton Intravital Imaging for Monitoring Leukocyte Recruitment during Arteriogenesis in a Murine Hindlimb Model.

ABSTRACT:
Arteriogenesis strongly depends on leukocyte and platelet recruitment to the perivascular space of growing collateral vessels. The standard approach for analyzing collateral arteries and leukocytes in arteriogenesis is ex vivo (immuno-) histological methodology. However, this technique does not allow the measurement of dynamic processes such as blood flow, shear stress, cell-cell interactions, and particle velocity. This paper presents a protocol to monitor in vivo processes in growing collateral arteries during arteriogenesis utilizing intravital imaging. The method described here is a reliable tool for dynamics measurement and offers a high-contrast analysis with minimal photo-cytotoxicity, provided by multiphoton excitation microscopy. Prior to analyzing growing collateral arteries, arteriogenesis was induced in the adductor muscle of mice by unilateral ligation of the femoral artery. After the ligation, the preexisting collateral arteries started to grow due to increased shear stress. Twenty-four hours after surgery, the skin and subcutaneous fat above the collateral arteries were removed, constructing a pocket for further analyses. To visualize blood flow and immune cells during in vivo imaging, CD41-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (platelets) and CD45-phycoerythrin (PE) (leukocytes) antibodies were injected intravenously (i.v.) via a catheter placed in the tail vein of a mouse. This article introduces intravital multiphoton imaging as an alternative or in vivo complementation to the commonly used static ex vivo (immuno-) histological analyses to study processes relevant for arteriogenesis. In summary, this paper describes a novel and dynamic in vivo method to investigate immune cell trafficking, blood flow, and shear stress in a hindlimb model of arteriogenesis, which enhances evaluation possibilities notably.

TITLE: Using Changes in Leaf Transmission to Investigate Chloroplast Movement in Arabidopsis thaliana.
AUTHORS: Königer Martina, Knapp Anna, Futami Lauren, Kohler Susan
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2021)
PMID: 34338664
DOI: 10.3791/62881

ABSTRACT:
Chloroplast movement in leaves has been shown to help minimize photoinhibition and increase growth under certain conditions. Much can be learned about chloroplast movement by studying the chloroplast positioning in leaves using e.g., confocal fluorescence microscopy, but access to this type of microscopy is limited. This protocol describes a method that uses the changes in leaf transmission as a proxy for chloroplast movement. If chloroplasts are spread out in order to maximize light interception, the transmission will be low. If chloroplasts move towards the anticlinal cell walls to avoid light, the transmission will be higher. This protocol describes how to use a straightforward, home-built instrument to expose leaves to different blue light intensities and quantify the dynamic changes in leaf transmission. This approach allows researchers to quantitatively describe chloroplast movement in different species and mutants, study the effects of chemicals and environmental factors on it, or screen for novel mutants e.g., to identify missing components in the process that leads from light perception to the movement of chloroplasts.

TITLE: Spatiotemporal Subcellular Manipulation of the Microtubule Cytoskeleton in the Living Preimplantation Mouse Embryo using Photostatins.
AUTHORS: Greaney Jessica, Hawdon Azelle, Stathatos G Gemma, Aberkane Asma, Zenker Jennifer
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2021)
PMID: 34927610
DOI: 10.3791/63290

ABSTRACT:
The microtubule cytoskeleton forms the framework of a cell and is fundamental for intracellular transport, cell division, and signal transduction. Traditional pharmacological disruption of the ubiquitous microtubule network using, for instance, nocodazole can have devastating consequences for any cell. Reversibly photoswitchable microtubule inhibitors have the potential to overcome the limitations by enabling drug effects to be implemented in a spatiotemporally-controlled manner. One such family of drugs is the azobenzene-based photostatins (PSTs). These compounds are inactive in dark conditions, and upon illumination with UV light, they bind to the colchicine-binding site of β-tubulin and block microtubule polymerization and dynamic turnover. Here, the application of PSTs in the 3-dimensional (3D) live preimplantation mouse embryo is set out to disrupt the microtubule network on a subcellular level. This protocol provides instructions for the experimental setup, as well as light activation and deactivation parameters for PSTs using live-cell confocal microscopy. This ensures reproducibility and enables others to apply this procedure to their research questions. Innovative photoswitches like PSTs may evolve as powerful tools to advance the understanding of the dynamic intracellular microtubule network and to non-invasively manipulate the cytoskeleton in real-time. Furthermore, PSTs may prove useful in other 3D structures such as organoids, blastoids, or embryos of other species.

TITLE: Light-Induced GFP Expression in Zebrafish Embryos using the Optogenetic TAEL/C120 System.
AUTHORS: LaBelle Jesselynn, Woo Stephanie
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2021)
PMID: 34487118
DOI: 10.3791/62818

ABSTRACT:
Inducible gene expression systems are an invaluable tool for studying biological processes. Optogenetic expression systems can provide precise control over gene expression timing, location, and amplitude using light as the inducing agent. In this protocol, an optogenetic expression system is used to achieve light-inducible gene expression in zebrafish embryos. This system relies on an engineered transcription factor called TAEL based on a naturally occurring light-activated transcription factor from the bacterium E. litoralis. When illuminated with blue light, TAEL dimerizes, binds to its cognate regulatory element called C120, and activates transcription. This protocol uses transgenic zebrafish embryos that express the TAEL transcription factor under the control of the ubiquitous ubb promoter. At the same time, the C120 regulatory element drives the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene (GFP). Using a simple LED panel to deliver activating blue light, induction of GFP expression can first be detected after 30 min of illumination and reaches a peak of more than 130-fold induction after 3 h of light treatment. Expression induction can be assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and by fluorescence microscopy. This method is a versatile and easy-to-use approach for optogenetic gene expression.

TITLE: Sarcomere Shortening of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes using Fluorescent-Tagged Sarcomere Proteins.
AUTHORS: Ahmed Razan E, Chanthra Nawin, Anzai Tatsuya, Koiwai Keiichiro, Murakami Tomoki, Suzuki Hiroaki, Hanazono Yutaka, Uosaki Hideki

ABSTRACT:
Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) can be produced from both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (ES/iPS) cells. These cells provide promising sources for cardiac disease modeling. For cardiomyopathies, sarcomere shortening is one of the standard physiological assessments that are used with adult cardiomyocytes to examine their disease phenotypes. However, the available methods are not appropriate to assess the contractility of PSC-CMs, as these cells have underdeveloped sarcomeres that are invisible under phase-contrast microscopy. To address this issue and to perform sarcomere shortening with PSC-CMs, fluorescent-tagged sarcomere proteins and fluorescent live-imaging were used. Thin Z-lines and an M-line reside at both ends and the center of a sarcomere, respectively. Z-line proteins - α-Actinin (ACTN2), Telethonin (TCAP), and actin-associated LIM protein (PDLIM3) - and one M-line protein - Myomesin-2 (Myom2) - were tagged with fluorescent proteins. These tagged proteins can be expressed from endogenous alleles as knock-ins or from adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Here, we introduce the methods to differentiate mouse and human pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, to produce AAVs, and to perform and analyze live-imaging. We also describe the methods for producing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps for a patterned culture of PSC-CMs, which facilitates the analysis of sarcomere shortening with fluorescent-tagged proteins. To assess sarcomere shortening, time-lapse images of the beating cells were recorded at a high framerate (50-100 frames per second) under electrical stimulation (0.5-1 Hz). To analyze sarcomere length over the course of cell contraction, the recorded time-lapse images were subjected to SarcOptiM, a plug-in for ImageJ/Fiji. Our strategy provides a simple platform for investigating cardiac disease phenotypes in PSC-CMs.

TITLE: Imaging the Nanoscale Distribution of Phosphoinositides in the Cell Plasma Membrane with Single-Molecule Localization Super-Resolution Microscopy.
AUTHORS: Fan Fan, Ji Chen, Lou Xuelin
JOURNAL: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) (2021)

ABSTRACT:
Phosphoinositides make up only a small fraction of cellular phospholipids yet control cell function in a fundamental manner. Through protein interactions, phosphoinositides define cellular organelle identity and regulate protein function and organization and recruitment at the cytosol-membrane interface. As a result, perturbations on phosphoinositide metabolism alter cell physiology and lead to a wide range of human diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Among seven phosphoinositide members, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2, also known as PI(4,5)P2 or PIP2) is abundant in the plasma membrane. Besides its role in the second messenger pathway of phospholipase C that cleaves PtdIns(4,5)P2 to form diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), PtdIns(4,5)P2 regulates membrane trafficking and the function of the cytoskeleton, ion channels, and transporters. The nanoscale organization of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane becomes essential to understand cellular signaling specificity in time and space. Here, we describe a single-molecule method to visualize the nanoscale distribution of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane by using super-resolution microscopy and the dual-color fluorescent probes based on the PLCδ1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This approach can be extended to image other phosphoinositides by changing the specific probes.

ABSTRACT:
The recent revolution in optical fluorescence microscopy, supported by the optimization of both spatial resolution and acquisition speed, led to the ability to visualize nano-scaled objects. Currently, the use of a new generation of super-resolution fluorescence microscopes coupled to improved fluorescent probes gives the possibility to study the replicative cycle of viruses in living cells, at the single-virus and molecule level. In this review, after a brief chronological description of these new approaches, we highlight several examples of super-resolution microscopies that have allowed to revisit our understanding of several human viruses and of host-pathogen interactions.

PMID: 34388788

ABSTRACT:
We propose a new super-resolution microscopy, named frequency interferometric localization microscopy (FILM). FILM is implemented by incorporating a Michelson interferometer into wide-field fluorescence microscope, which introduces coherence time as a new auxiliary axis to obtain the spectral information of individual fluorophores. After the time-wavelength transformation, the homogeneous linewidth of individual fluorophores can be isolated from the inhomogeneous broadening distribution of the fluorophore ensemble. Thus, the nearby fluorophores with a distinguishable central wavelength can be separated in the frequency domain and localized with accuracy beyond the diffraction limit. The principle of the method, experimental schematics, and reconstruction algorithm are numerically demonstrated. With properly prepared fluorophores, FILM has the potential to reach, in principle, molecular-scale spatial resolution.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule (SM) quantification has become a powerful analytical technique in the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology. SM imaging, especially with super-resolution (SR) techniques, has dramatically facilitated the study of individual molecules that may function as disease-related biomarkers. Although multiple properties can be used for quantitative imaging analysis, counting may be the simplest and most direct way. Consequently, how to utilize the greater spatial resolution to overcome undercounting or overcounting errors in certain conditions shows promising potential to unravel intracellular mechanisms of isolated biomolecules. From this perspective, we present an absolute quantification approach, termed crucial connected-component entropy (CCCE), with subresolution accuracy for the SR SM detection platform without the need for prior knowledge of calibration, and a cross-validation analytical pipeline based on SM profiling for nanoscale performance assessments. Considering its high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for routine SM quantification compared with commonly used strategies, we believe that this protocol will indubitably find wide applications in biochemistry research, drug discovery, and clinical diagnostics, especially molecular diagnostics.

ABSTRACT:
Naïve lymphocytes recirculate from the blood to the lymphoid tissues under physiological condition and it is commonly recognized as an important phenomenon in the gut immunity. The stroma of secondary lymphoid organs, such as Peyer's patches (PPs) or mesenteric lymph nodes, are where naïve lymphocytes sense antigens. Naïve lymphocytes circulate through the bloodstream to reach high endothelial venules, the portal of entry into PPs. Some immunomodulators are estimated to influence lymphocyte migration, but the precise evaluation of microcirculation dynamics is very difficult, and establishing a method to observe lymphocyte migration in vivo can contribute to the clarification of the precise mechanisms. We refined the method of collecting lymphocytes from the lymph duct and observing the detailed dynamics of gut-tropic lymphocytes in rat PPs. We chose confocal laser scanning microscopy to observe rat PPs in vivo and recorded it using time-lapse photography. We can now obtain clear images that can contribute to the analysis of lymphocyte dynamics.

DOI: 10.3791/60790

ABSTRACT:
Intravital microscopy of the gut using confocal imaging allows real time observation of epithelial cell shedding and barrier leakage in living animals. Therefore, the intestinal mucosa of anesthetized mice is topically stained with unspecific staining (acriflavine) and a fluorescent tracer (rhodamine-B dextran), mounted on a saline solution-rinsed plate and directly imaged using a confocal microscope. This technique can complement other non-invasive techniques to identify leakage of intestinal permeability, such as transmucosal passage of orally administered tracers. Besides this, the approach presented here allows the direct observation of cell shedding events at real-time. In combination with appropriate fluorescent reporter mice, this approach is suitable for shedding light into cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling intestinal epithelial cell extrusion, as well as to other biological processes. In the last decades, interesting studies using intravital microscopy have contributed to knowledge on endothelial permeability, immune cell gut homing, immune-epithelial communication and invasion of luminal components, among others. Together, the protocol presented here would not only help increase the understanding of mechanisms controlling epithelial cell extrusion, but could also be the basis for the developmental of other approaches to be used as instruments to visualize other highly dynamic cellular process, even in other tissues. Among technical limitations, optical properties of the specific tissue, as well as the selected imaging technology and microscope configuration, would in turn, determine the imaging working distance, and resolution of acquired images.

PMID: 32009643
DOI: 10.3791/60279

ABSTRACT:
Many studies suggest that the enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may show promise as a prognostic tool for ovarian cancer. Current strategies for the detection of CTCs include flow cytometry, microfluidic devices, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Despite recent advances, methods for the detection of early ovarian cancer metastasis still lack the sensitivity and specificity required for clinical translation. Here, a novel method is presented for the detection of ovarian circulating tumor cells by photoacoustic flow cytometry (PAFC) utilizing a custom three dimensional (3D) printed system, including a flow chamber and syringe pump. This method utilizes folic acid-capped copper sulfide nanoparticles (FA-CuS NPs) to target SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells by PAFC. This work demonstrates the affinity of these contrast agents for ovarian cancer cells. The results show NP characterization, PAFC detection, and NP uptake by fluorescence microscopy, thus demonstrating the potential of this novel system to detect ovarian CTCs at physiologically relevant concentrations.

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents detailed methods on detecting hepatic mitochondrial function for a better understanding the cause of metabolic disorders caused by environmental organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in hepatocytes. HepG2 cells were exposed to β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) for 24 h at an equivalent dose of internal exposure in general population. Ultrastructure in hepatocytes was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to show the damage of mitochondria. Mitochondrial function was further evaluated by mitochondrial fluorescence intensity, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in HepG2 cells incubated with β-HCH. The mitochondria fluorescence intensity after stained by mitochondrial green fluorescent probe was observed with a fluorescence microscopy. The luciferin-luciferase reaction was used to determine ATP levels. The MMP was detected by the cationic dye JC-1 and analyzed under flow cytometry. OCR was measured with an extracellular flux analyzer. In summary, these protocols were used in detecting mitochondrial function in hepatocytes with to investigate mitochondria damages.

ABSTRACT:
In the present work, the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles, its coating with SiO2, followed by its amine functionalization with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and its conjugation with deferoxamine, a siderophore recognized by Yersinia enterocolitica, using a succinyl moiety as a linker are described. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) of magnetite (Fe3O4) were prepared by solvothermal method and coated with SiO2 (MNP@SiO2) using the Stöber process followed by functionalization with APTES (MNP@SiO2@NH2). Then, feroxamine was conjugated with the MNP@SiO2@NH2 by carbodiimide coupling to give MNP@SiO2@NH2@Fa. The morphology and properties of the conjugate and intermediates were examined by eight different methods including powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) mapping. This exhaustive characterization confirmed the formation of the conjugate. Finally, in order to evaluate the capacity and specificity of the nanoparticles, they were tested in a capture bacteria assay using Yersinia enterocolitica.

TITLE: Displacement Analysis of Myocardial Mechanical Deformation (DIAMOND) Reveals Segmental Heterogeneity of Cardiac Function in Embryonic Zebrafish.

PMID: 32090990
DOI: 10.3791/60547

ABSTRACT:
Zebrafish are increasingly utilized as a model organism for cardiomyopathies and regeneration. Current methods evaluating cardiac function fail to reliably detect segmental mechanics and are not readily feasible in zebrafish. Here we present a semiautomated, open-source method for the quantitative assessment of four-dimensional (4D) segmental cardiac function: displacement analysis of myocardial mechanical deformation (DIAMOND). Transgenic embryonic zebrafish were imaged in vivo using a light-sheet fluorescence microscopy system with 4D cardiac motion synchronization. Acquired 3D digital hearts were reconstructed at end-systole and end-diastole, and the ventricle was manually segmented into binary datasets. Then, the heart was reoriented and isotropically resampled along the true short axis, and the ventricle was evenly divided into eight portions (I-VIII) along the short axis. Due to the different resampling planes and matrices at end-systole and end-diastole, a transformation matrix was applied for image registration to restore the original spatial relationship between the resampled systolic and diastolic image matrices. After image registration, the displacement vector of each segment from end-systole to end-diastole was calculated based on the displacement of mass centroids in three dimensions (3D). DIAMOND shows that basal myocardial segments adjacent to the atrioventricular canal undergo the highest mechanical deformation and are the most susceptible to doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury. Overall, DIAMOND provides novel insights into segmental cardiac mechanics in zebrafish embryos beyond traditional ejection fraction (EF) under both physiological and pathological conditions.

The purpose of this protocol is to detail a proven method for preparing plasmonic nanoparticle samples and performing single particle spectroscopy on them with DIC microscopy. Several important steps must be followed carefully in order to perform repeatable spectroscopy experiments. First, landmarks can be etched into the sample substrate, which aids in locating the sample surface and in tracking the region of interest during experiments. Next, the substrate must be properly cleaned of debris and contaminants that can otherwise hinder or obscure examination of the sample. Once a sample is properly prepared, the optical path of the microscope must be aligned, using Kohler Illumination. With a standard Nomarski style DIC microscope, rotation of the sample may be necessary, particularly when the plasmonic nanoparticles exhibit orientation-dependent optical properties. Because DIC microscopy has two inherent orthogonal polarization fields, the wavelength-dependent DIC contrast pattern reveals the orientation of rod-shaped plasmonic nanoparticles. Finally, data acquisition and data analyses must be carefully performed. It is common to represent DIC-based spectroscopy data as a contrast value, but it is also possible to present it as intensity data. In this demonstration of DIC for single particle spectroscopy, the focus is on spherical and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles.

ABSTRACT:
Single-molecule imaging has greatly advanced our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biological studies. However, it has been challenging to obtain large field-of-view, high-contrast images in thick cells and tissues. Here, we introduce highly inclined swept tile (HIST) microscopy that overcomes this problem. A pair of cylindrical lenses was implemented to generate an elongated excitation beam that was scanned over a large imaging area via a fast galvo mirror. A 4f configuration was used to position optical components. A scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor camera detected the fluorescence signal and blocked the out-of-focus background with a dynamic confocal slit synchronized with the beam sweeping. We present a step-by-step instruction on building the HIST microscope with all basic components.

ABSTRACT:
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like antimicrobial structures consisting of DNA and granule derived antimicrobial proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy and image-based quantification methods remain important tools to quantitate neutrophil extracellular trap formation. However, there are key limitations to the immunofluorescence-based methods that are currently available for quantifying NETs. Manual methods of image-based NET quantification are often subjective, prone to error and tedious for users, especially non-experienced users. Also, presently available software options for quantification are either semi-automatic or require training prior to operation. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of an automated immunofluorescence-based image quantification method to evaluate NET formation called NETQUANT. The software is easy to use and has a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). It considers biologically relevant parameters such as an increase in the surface area and DNA:NET marker protein ratio, and nuclear deformation to define NET formation. Furthermore, this tool is built as a freely available app, and allows for single-cell resolution quantification and analysis.

ABSTRACT:
We herein present a method for the synthesis of HNbWO6, HNbMoO6, HTaWO6 solid acid nanosheet modified Pt/CNTs. By varying the weight of various solid acid nanosheets, a series of Pt/xHMNO6/CNTs with different solid acid compositions (x = 5, 20 wt%; M = Nb, Ta; N = Mo, W) have been prepared by carbon nanotube pretreatment, protonic exchange, solid acid exfoliation, aggregation and finally Pt particles impregnation. The Pt/xHMNO6/CNTs are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and NH3-temperature programmed desorption. The study revealed that HNbWO6 nanosheets were attached on CNTs, with some edges of the nanosheets being bent in shape. The acid strength of the supported Pt catalysts increases in the following order: Pt/CNTs < Pt/5HNbWO6/CNTs < Pt/20HNbMoO6/CNTs < Pt/20HNbWO6/CNTs < Pt/20HTaWO6/CNTs. In addition, the catalytic hydroconversion of lignin-derived model compound: diphenyl ether using the synthesized Pt/20HNbWO6 catalyst has been investigated.

TITLE: Generation of Cancer Cell Clones to Visualize Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA TERRA Expressed from a Single Telomere in Living Cells.

ABSTRACT:
Telomeres are transcribed, giving rise to telomeric repeat-containing long noncoding RNAs (TERRA), which have been proposed to play important roles in telomere biology, including heterochromatin formation and telomere length homeostasis. Recent findings revealed that TERRA molecules also interact with internal chromosomal regions to regulate gene expression in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In line with this evidence, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) analyses have shown that only a subset of TERRA transcripts localize at chromosome ends. A better understanding of the dynamics of TERRA molecules will help define their function and mechanisms of action. Here, we describe a method to label and visualize single-telomere TERRA transcripts in cancer cells using the MS2-GFP system. To this aim, we present a protocol to generate stable clones, using the AGS human stomach cancer cell line, containing MS2 sequences integrated at a single subtelomere. Transcription of TERRA from the MS2-tagged telomere results in the expression of MS2-tagged TERRA molecules that are visualized by live-cell fluorescence microscopy upon co-expression of a MS2 RNA-binding protein fused to GFP (MS2-GFP). This approach enables researchers to study the dynamics of single-telomere TERRA molecules in cancer cells, and it can be applied to other cell lines.

TITLE: Quantifying Compartment-Specific Protein Translocation in Astrocytes by Object-Oriented Image Analysis: Mitochondrial Translocation of PKCδ.

ABSTRACT:
Assessing the amount and subcellular distribution of protein expression is a key component in modern cell biological and medical research. We studied protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as a potential regulator of mitochondrial metabolism in astrocytes, and sought to evaluate mitochondrial translocation of PKCδ since this is an important determinant of its function. Apart from visualizing compartment specific localization of mobile proteins such as PKCδ, we also wanted to determine what amount of a cell's total content of a particular protein is located to a specific compartment, or translocated comparing control and experimental condition.We develop a semiquantitative parameter that indicates the relative protein distribution to two subcellular compartments, starting from standard two-channel fluorescence microscopy images. We studied the mitochondrial translocation of PKCδ in astrocytes using double immunofluorescence microscopy and object-oriented image analysis. In one channel, the protein of interest (PKCδ) is labeled, in the other the compartment or organelle of interest (mitochondria, using cytochrome oxidase IV). Both channels were binarized, turned into object populations, and the channel specific values for total area and integrated intensity extracted. From these values, the "intensity density ratio" (IDR) is calculated, a standardized parameter to easily compare distribution patterns in different cells or ROIs. IDR is highly sensitive to changes in localization pattern, and thus easily detects protein translocation in comparison between control and experimental condition. In our study, medium application of glutamate was found to result in partial PKCδ translocation to mitochondria, a statistically highly significant result based only on a limited number of acquired images.

ABSTRACT:
We propose a method to improve the axial response of structured illumination microscopy via selection of an illumination pattern with a sinusoidal or square wave within the cutoff frequency of the imaging system. Residual modulation within a sectioned image is mitigated by accurate phase-shifting via the electrical spatial light modulator control signal, which is based on an illumination pattern having a suitable waveform. Reduction in residual modulation is observed in the sinusoidal pattern with a spatial frequency sufficiently below the cutoff frequency of the imaging system. This reduction is larger for the square wave as the spatial frequency approaches one-third of the cutoff frequency.

ABSTRACT:
Quantitative acoustic microscopy (QAM) permits the formation of quantitative two-dimensional (2D) maps of acoustic and mechanical properties of soft tissues at microscopic resolution. The 2D maps formed using our custom SAM systems employing a 250-MHz and a 500-MHz single-element transducer have a nominal resolution of 7 μm and 4μm, respectively. In a previous study, the potential of single-image super-resolution (SR) image post-processing to enhance the spatial resolution of 2D SAM maps was demonstrated using a forward model accounting for blur, decimation, and noise. However, results obtained when the SR method was applied to soft tissue data were not entirely satisfactory because of the limitation of the convolution model considered and by the difficulty of estimating the system point spread function and designing the appropriate regularization term. Therefore, in this study, a machine learning approach based on convolutional neural networks was implemented. For training, data acquired on the same samples at 250 and 500 MHz were used. The resulting trained network was tested on 2D impedance maps (2DZMs) of human lymph nodes acquired from breast-cancer patients. Visual inspection of the reconstructed enhanced 2DZMs were found similar to the 2DZMs obtained at 500 MHz which were used as ground truth. In addition, the enhanced 250-MHz 2DZMs obtained from the proposed method yielded better peak signal to noise ratio and normalized mean square error than those obtained with the previous SR method. This improvement was also demonstrated by the statistical analyses. This pioneering work could significantly reduce challenges and costs associated with current very high-frequency SAM systems while providing enhanced spatial resolution.

ABSTRACT:
Immature stages of Murgantia histrionica (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) are described using light and scanning electron microscopy. Specimens of all life stages of M. histrionica were collected on Peritoma arborea (Cleomaceae) in Palm Springs, California. Specimens were observed in light and scanning microscopies, imagens taken and described based on specimens and photographs. We provide images of the eggs and immatures in light microscopy, and SEM of the eggs and first and fifth instars. Eggs of M. histrionica are barrel-shaped, white, with brown band and circular spot; the corium surface carinated, forming hexagonal cells; carinae irregular apically. The nymphal color pattern; the reflexed lateral margins of pro- and mesothorax; and the scattered punctuation of the tegument are a combination of characteristics enabling M. histrionica identification in its nymphal stages. The eggs of M. histrionica are similar in shape, color, and size to other Strachiini genera, such as Bagrada, Eurydema and Stenozygum. Among the Strachiini, the correct identification of M. histrionica based on immatures is possible by the shape of the head and pronotum, overall size of immatures, and coloration patterns.

ABSTRACT:
To improve the imaging speed of a confocal microscope with virtual structured detection, we have designed an optical system with rigid coordination control of the CCD, galvanometer scanner, and laser diode. In this system, the width of the coherent transfer function expands, which enhances the lateral resolution by a factor of 1.4. Also, the temporal image sequence is transformed to a spatial one so that multiple images can be acquired during a single exposure period of the CCD. This method increases the system imaging speed 25-fold at least, and an even higher speed can be achieved by further increasing the number of spots recorded during a single exposure period.

ABSTRACT:
In the eukaryotic cell, a large macromolecular channel, known as the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), mediates all molecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In recent years, single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) imaging has emerged as a powerful tool to study the molecular mechanism of transport through the NPC. More recently, techniques such as single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) have enabled the spatial and temporal distribution of cargos, transport receptors and even structural components of the NPC to be determined with nanometre accuracy. In this protocol, we describe a method to study the position and/or motion of individual molecules transiting through the NPC with high spatial and temporal precision.

ABSTRACT:
FtsZ--a bacterial tubulin homolog--is one of the key bacterial division proteins, forming a contractile Z-ring at the midcell of dividing bacteria. In this work immunofluorescent labeling was used in conjunction with single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to visualize native structures formed by FtsZ protein in Escherichia coli cells. This approach allowed the reorganization of FtsZ structures during cytokinesis to be visualized step-by-step. New data was obtained that support the hypothesis that the Z-ring is a spiral structure that constricts during division, assisting the formation of the septum between daughter cells.

ABSTRACT:
Micro-emulsions and sometimes nano-emulsions are well known candidates to deliver drugs locally. However, the poor rheological properties are marginally affecting their acceptance pharmaceutically. This work aimed to modify the poor flow properties of a nano-scaled emulsion comprising palm olein esters as the oil phase and ibuprofen as the active ingredient for topical delivery. Three Carbopol ® resins: 934, 940 and Ultrez 10, were utilized in various concentrations to achieve these goals. Moreover, phosphate buffer and triethanolamine solutions pH 7.4 were used as neutralizing agents to assess their effects on the gel-forming and swelling properties of Carbopol ® 940. The addition of these polymers caused the produced nano-scaled emulsion to show a dramatic droplets enlargement of the dispersed globules, increased intrinsic viscosity, consistent zeta potential and transparent-to-opaque change in appearance. These changes were relatively influenced by the type and the concentration of the resin used. Carbopol ® 940 and triethanolamine appeared to be superior in achieving the proposed tasks compared to other materials. The higher the pH of triethanolamine solution, the stronger the flow-modifying properties of Carbopol ® 940. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a well-arranged gel network of Carbopol ® 940, which was the major cause for all realized changes. Later in vitro permeation studies showed a significant decrease in the drug penetration, thus further modification using 10% w/w menthol or limonene as permeation promoters was performed. This resulted in in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamics properties that are comparably higher than the reference chosen for this study.

JOURNAL: Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology (2012)
PMID: 23457790

ABSTRACT:
The on-site labeling and localization tracking of membrane proteins in pathogenic bacteria are tedious work. In order to develop a novel protein labeling technology at super resolution level (nanometer scale) using the photoactivatable localization microscopy (PALM), the chimeric protein of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the photoactivatable mEos2m protein were expressed in the non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. The recombinant bacteria were fixed on slide, activated by 405 nm laser and subject to PALM imaging to capture photons released by the fusion protein. Meanwhile, colony and cell morphology were visualized under regular fluorescent stereomicroscope and upright fluorescent microscope to characterize fluorescence conversion and protein localization. The fusion proteins formed a "belt"-like structure on cell membrane of M. smegmatis under PALM, providing direct evidence of on-site imaging of membrane proteins. Expression of fusion protein did not compromise the localization properties of OmpA. Thus, mEos2m could be used as a labeling probe to track localizations of non-oligomer oriented membrane proteins. This indicates non-pathogenic M. smegmatis could be served as a model strain to characterize the function and localization of the proteins derived from pathogenic M. tuberculosis. This is the first report using PALM to characterize localization of membrane proteins.

TITLE: Distinct expression, localization and function of two Rab7 proteins encoded by paralogous genes in a free-living model eukaryote.

ABSTRACT:
Rab7 GTPases are involved in membrane trafficking in the late endosomal/lysosomal pathway. In Paramecium octaurelia Rab7a and Rab7b are encoded by paralogous genes. Antipeptide antibodies generated against divergent C-termini recognize Rab7a of 22.5 kDa and Rab7b of 25 kDa, respectively. In 2D gel electrophoresis two immunoreactive spots were identified for Rab7b at pI about 6.34 and about 6.18 and only one spot for Rab7a of pI about 6.34 suggesting post-translational modification of Rab7b. Mass spectrometry revealed eight identical phosphorylated residues in the both proteins. ProQ Emerald staining and ConA overlay of immunoprecipitated Rab7b indicated its putative glycosylation that was further supported by a faster electrophoretic mobility of this protein upon deglycosylation. Such a post-translational modification and substitution of Ala(140) in Rab7a for Ser(140) in Rab7b may result in distinct targeting to the oral apparatus where Rab7b associates with the microtubular structures as revealed by STED confocal and electron microscopy. Rab7a was mapped to phagosomal compartment. Absolute qReal-Time PCR analysis revealed that expression of Rab7a was 2.6-fold higher than that of Rab7b. Upon latex internalization it was further 2-fold increased for Rab7a and only slightly for Rab7b. Post-transcriptional gene silencing of rab7a suppressed phagosome formation by 70 % and impaired their acidification. Ultrastructural analysis with double immunogold labeling revealed that this effect was due to the lack of V-ATPase recruitment to phagolysosomes. No significant phenotype changes were noticed in cells upon rab7b silencing. In conclusion, Rab7b acquired a new function, whereas Rab7a can be assigned to the phagolysosomal pathway.

ABSTRACT:
Hydrologic process, turbidity, suspended particles matters (SPM), major cations and TOC concentrations during two storm events in late April 2008 were monitored at Jiangjia Spring which is the outlet of Qingmu Guan underground river system. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) analyses of SPM were also performed in order to investigate the transport characteristics of substances, such as SPM, turbidity and major cations in the underground river of typical karst watershed. The results show that at a single and well-developed karst conduit of Jiangjia Spring, discharge, turbidity, and concentrations of SPM, major cations and TOC respond promptly to the rainfall. The carbonate-derived cations including Ca2+, Mg2+ and Sr2+ are subject to dilution effect during the rising limb of discharge. The elevation in turbidity and SPM concentration is a result of the gradual increase of allochthonous substances (soil) flux input from the surface. Al3+, Fe, Mn, Ba2+ and TOC are concomitant substances of SPM. And their concentrations are ascending with turbid rise. The flux of SPM in diameter > 0.45 microm in the underground river is about 9.7 tons during the events. The bad water quality suggests us that the spring water is unfit to drink without purification during the period of rising and recession time of discharge at Jiangjia Spring. Thus, soil erosion and nutrient losing not only strongly destroy the fragile karst ecological environment, but also lead to non-point source pollution, and seriously threaten the drinking water safety of locals.

ABSTRACT:
192 samples of Masked Palm Civet (Paguma Larvata) from Guangdong Province were inoculated in Vero-E6 cells. One sample which came from masked palm Civet didn't cause cytopathic effects (CPE) until fourth-passage on Vero-E6 cells. Infected cells emerged granulating, shrinking, rounding and falling off. After three times freeze-thaw, cells and culture medium were harvested for electron microscopy. Virus particles were nonenveloped, double capsid and icosahedral symmetry. This virus was designated Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04). Hemagglutination test indicated that the virus could agglutinate healthy human type O red cells, but not the red cells of SPF chicken, experimental common bovine, rat and guinea pig. This virus was tolerant to chloroform treatment, pH 3.0 and water bath 50 degrees C 1 h. 1 M MgCl2 treatment could enhance resistance of virus to heat and increase infectivity. In order to classify the strain on the molecular level, specific primers according to mammalian reovirus were used for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Appropriate specific products were amplified by RT-PCR. NCBI BLAST analysis indicated that this segment shared the highest identity to mammalian reovirus serotype 1 (T1L) virus. So we can deduce this virus is a member of the Reoviridae.

TITLE: Opsonization with a trifunctional bispecific (alphaCD3 x alphaEpCAM) antibody results in efficient lysis in vitro and in vivo of EpCAM positive tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

ABSTRACT:
Removab is a trifunctional bispecific antibody which can bridge CD3+ T cells and epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive (EpCAM+) tumor cells, and binds with its Fc fragment to antigen presenting cells. To explore a new approach for the treatment of patients with carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract, we investigated whether Removab can induce specific cellular responses to the EpCAM+ carcinoma cell line BHY. Particular emphasis was put on the opsonization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMN) with respect to clinical application. Tumor cells and allogeneic PBMN of healthy volunteers were incubated with or without Removab. In a third group, PBMN were opsonized with Removab and washed before incubation with tumor cells. Inverse microscopy, ELISPOT, flow cytometry analysis and cytotoxicity assays on the chorioallantois membrane (CAM) were performed. In comparison with PBMN alone, opsonization with Removab resulted in: a) activation of CD83+ antigen presenting cells, b) secretion of interferon gamma, and c) granzyme B mediated lysis of targeted BHY cells by EpCAM specific CD8+ T cells. The secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma and interleukin-2 by opsonized PBMN was significantly reduced after 24 h. Washed opsonized PBMN maintained their lytic activity against tumor cells as tested on the CAM. Removab is an appropriate agent for the therapeutic amplification of T cell responses against EpCAM+ tumor cells by opsonization of PBMN without putting patients at risk for severe adverse events caused by a cytokine storm.

TITLE: Number and distribution of interstitial cells lining the epidermis of normal human skin from different anatomical locations.
AUTHORS: Lu Dong Qing, Sueki Hirohiko, Iijima Masafumi
JOURNAL: European journal of dermatology : EJD (2002)
PMID: 11872411

ABSTRACT:
A study was conducted to determine the number and distribution of interstitial cells lining the epidermis of normal human skin from various anatomical locations. Five to seven normal human skin specimens per each anatomical site were collected from surgical specimens, mostly with pigmented nevi. Ten anatomical locations were classified; and a total of 65 normal human skin samples were evaluated. The number of interstitial cells lining the epidermis was quantified under light microscopy using a computer-assisted image analyzer. Two types of interstitial cells were recognized beneath the dermo-epidermal junction of normal human skin: cells containing oval nuclei and spindle-shaped cells containing elongated nuclei. As for the number of oval cells, no significant difference was found among the anatomical locations. In contrast, significantly greater numbers of spindle-shaped cells were found in the palm (4.11 + 1.24; p < 0.01), sole (3.52 + 0.83; p < 0.001) and buttock (2.52 + 0.49; p < 0.01), compared with those in the anterior trunk (0.60 + 0.22). In normal skin of the palm and sole, the number of spindle-shaped cells located beneath the apices of rete ridges (7.35 + 1.56) was significantly greater than along the dermal papillae (1.39 + 0.39, p < 0.01). However, cells containing oval nuclei also predominated beneath the apices of rete ridges, but the difference was not significant. In summary, the present study demonstrated that the number of spindle-shaped cells, quantified by H & E staining, was significantly greater beneath the apices of rete ridges than in dermal papillae. The number was greater in palm and sole skin compared with other samples of normal human skin. This data may relate to the glabrous nature of palm and sole skin.

AUTHORS: Ponten Fredrik, Tømmerås Karin, Larsson Erik
JOURNAL: Lakartidningen (2002)
PMID: 12362765

ABSTRACT:
The paper describes the use of laser-assisted microdissection to retrieve microscopically defined cell populations including single cells from tissue sections for subsequent analysis of genomic DNA and mRNA. A general background is given on the techniques available and requirements for PCR based on minute templates. Different pre-PCR approaches are briefly described and possibilities and limitations of using archival material compared to fresh frozen tissue are discussed. In the article we give one example on how we have used the PALM laser microscopy system in combination with a nested, multiplex PCR system to analyze single normal keratinocytes as well as tumor cells from a case of basal cell cancer. We found that p53 mutations are common in normal, chronically sun-exposed skin. Widespread yet common mutations in the p53 gene that were unrelated to immunoreactivity for the p53 antibody were found in tumor cells. In addition there were rare mutations in occasional tumor cells that apparently did not result in selective growth advantage. Perspectives for the future are presented and the potential of laser assisted microdissection is highlighted within the fields of cancer research, developmental studies as well as studies of inflammatory and degenerative diseases. The combination of a method that allows careful selection of defined cells with powerful micro array based techniques, provides a setting with potential to uncover pathogenic mechanisms for large variety of human diseases.

TITLE: Development and transmission of Cowdria ruminantium by Amblyomma males transferred from infected to susceptible sheep.
AUTHORS: Kocan K M, Norval R A, Donovan P L
JOURNAL: Revue d'elevage et de medecine veterinaire des pays tropicaux (1993)
PMID: 8134630

ABSTRACT:
Male Amblyomma sp. were tested as vectors of Cowdria ruminantium, causative agent of heartwater disease. The males were allowed to feed on sheep experimentally infected with C. ruminantium and then were transferred to susceptible sheep to test for transmission of the rickettsia. The experiments were done in two trials. In the first trial, A. hebraeum were exposed to the Palm River stock of C. ruminantium, while in the second trial the Kiswani stock of Cowdria was tested with A. variegatum. Ticks were collected daily throughout each experiment, cut in half, and processed for light and electron microscopy to study development of C. ruminantium in tick tissues. In both trials, the male ticks transmitted Cowdria to one of two susceptible sheep. When ticks were examined with microscopy, a few colonies were found in gut cells while none were seen in salivary glands. Both species of ticks were infected with Rickettsia conorii, as evidenced by the occurrence of rickettsiae in the nucleus and cytoplasm of salivary gland cells.

PMID: 2628484

ABSTRACT:
Based on the hypothesis of the magnetoreceptor function of the pineal gland, a comparative study has been made, with electronic microscopy, of the numerical variations of the synaptic ribbons of the pinealocytes (indicating the cellular metabolic activity) of the groups of rats, under magnetic storm conditions and in calm days. In this quantitative study it was established that the incidence of synaptic ribbons per each 20,000 microns 2 of pineal tissue was smaller in the group of animals sacrificed during geomagnetic storms, as compared with the other group of animals sacrificed in calm periods (P less than 0.001). It was suggested that the synaptic ribbons may be morphological indicators of the pineal activity, with respect to the variations of the geomagnetic field.

ABSTRACT:
The three-dimensional structure of the connective tissue core (CTC) of the four types of lingual papillae of the crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was studied by scanning electron microscopy after removal of the epithelial cell layer by long-term treatment with hydrochloric acid at room temperature and compared with the results obtained from light microscopy. 1) Filiform papillae are densely distributed on the dorsal surface of the anterior two thirds of the tongue. Fungiform papillae are scattered among these filiform papillae, and are numerous at the anterior margin of the tongue. The connective tissue core of each filiform papilla looked like a lifting human hand with its palm towards the tongue tip. By using light microscopy, AF-positive elastic fibers were accumurated very densely just beneath the basal region of the anterior column epithelium of each filiform papilla. 2) CTC of fungiform papilla showed coralliform structure whose branches were ramified a few times. On the top of each branch there was a small depression where a taste bud was situated. 3) After removal of the epithelial cell layer of the foliate papilla, longitudinal grooves coinciding with the epithelial slits were observed. Some glandular ducts were seen protruding towards the exfoliated epithelium. 4) After removal of the covering epithelium of the vallate papilla, numerous small rod-shaped secondary CT cores appeared on the large primary CT core.

ABSTRACT:
Wedge-like preparations from the palm in Dupuytren's disease in many stages are investigated histologically and with scanning electron microscopy. The preparations comprise the entire soft tissue covering (skin, fat and aponeurosis). The scanning electron microscope enables a three dimensional examination of the surface of the collagen fibers. The following results were obtained: In the region of the skin contraction or the node: There is a displacement and atrophy of the fat layers by the proliferated and thickened connective tissue. The transitions between the various layers are obliterated. The collagen fibers perpendicular to the skin show massive cross-linking and thickening. The pathologically altered aponeurosis shows a variable morphology: the collagen bundles display major variations in diameter and structure. Typing of the disease stage and the morphological alterations is not possible.

ABSTRACT:
An imaging technique called ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) has emerged as a means of achieving super-resolution microvascular imaging through localization and tracking of microbubbles (MBs) in blood vessels. However, the use of ULM in preclinical and clinical applications has presented challenges such as prolonged data acquisition times and specific MB injection requirements. To address this drawback, in the present study, erythrocyte ULM (eULM), a contrast-free method for microvascular imaging with a high spatiotemporal resolution that is based on ultra-high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS), was proposed. This technique involves localizing and tracking erythrocytes rather than MBs to achieve super-resolution cerebrovascular imaging. To assess its performance, we conducted two conventional ULM procedures under identical conditions, comparing the image resolution and ability to the measure cerebrovascular hemodynamics of the conventional and proposed ULM procedures. The estimated spatial resolutions for eULM and conventional ULM were 7.3 μm and approximately 10-13 μm, respectively. eULM yielded satisfactory results with just 30-s data accumulation, whereas most ULM techniques typically require 1-10 min for data acquisition. eULM is an in vivo contrast-free ultrasound microvascular imaging method capable of achieving microscopic resolution for live organ imaging. This innovation holds promise as an invaluable diagnostic tool for various diseases that involve changes in microvascular blood flow, making it suitable for both preclinical and clinical applications due to its contrast-free imaging capabilities. Keywrods: high frequnecy ultrasound imaging, super-resolution imaging, microvascular imaging, Doppler ultrasound, brain flow imaging.

PMID: 41325435
DOI: 10.3791/69156

ABSTRACT:
In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) has gained significant attention for its non-invasive nature and high resolution. It enables in vivo observation and objective quantification of numerous dry eye disease (DED)-related ocular surface structures, including the cornea, conjunctiva, eyelid margin, meibomian glands, and parasites such as Demodex, at the cellular level. This capability assists ophthalmologists in identifying specific etiologies and subtypes of DED, thereby facilitating precise diagnosis, targeted treatment, and prognostic evaluation. However, standardized protocols for IVCM operation and reporting remain lacking. Proficiency in both ophthalmic knowledge and technical operation is essential to effectively utilize this device and generate high-quality reports. This article details the procedural steps and nuances of IVCM examination for DED patients. This is the first JoVE step-by-step IVCM protocol for DED. It aims to serve as a reference for clinicians, helping them avoid operational inefficiencies and consistently obtain high-quality corneal and ocular surface images to guide clinical management.

ABSTRACT:
The vitreous is a clear gel that fills the space between the lens and retina. Its structure is supported by a network of collagen fibers, which likely influences viscoelastic properties and contributes to retinal disease. However, the organization of this collagen network remains poorly characterized because imaging the vitreous in its native state is challenging. Many imaging techniques applied to the vitreous cause dehydration and distortion, and dye-based methods can introduce artifacts or nonspecific labeling, making it difficult to study the collagen network. In this protocol, we outline: 1) a method for dissecting porcine eyes for imaging; 2) a strategy for mounting the eyes on an inverted microscope; 3) guidelines for imaging the vitreous collagen network in its native state using confocal reflectance microscopy; and 4) instructions for quantitative image analysis of network features. We highlight common pitfalls and emphasize key technical points. We report the application of confocal reflectance microscopy to the vitreous. Compared with prior vitreous imaging strategies, this approach preserves the native structure, orientation, and distribution of vitreous collagen fibers without exogenous dyes or dehydration artifacts. Confocal reflectance microscopy can probe the structural basis of vitreous gel stiffness in health and disease.

ABSTRACT:
Protein location changes in the microstructure often present a precise regulation mechanism at the level of pathological organelles. How to accurately capture the location of this organelle protein transfer has positive significance and value for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Mitochondria play a central role in necrosis and the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Under normal conditions, cytochrome c (Cyt c) only exists between the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria and in the nucleus. When cells undergo apoptosis, the mitochondrial inner membrane permeability is altered, and Cyt c is released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. In this study, a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was established, and the micromorphological changes of neurons undergoing apoptosis were shown by immuno-transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, it shows the vision of immunogold labeling Cyt c transfer from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury more precisely. The immuno-transmission electron microscopy technique presented in this protocol is suitable for the demonstration of any protein position transitions at the microscopic level.

ABSTRACT:
The cerebral microvasculature forms a complex network of vessels essential for maintaining brain function. Diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, gliomas, and vascular dementia can profoundly disrupt the microvascular system. Unfortunately, current medical imaging modalities offer only indirect observations at this scale. Inspired by optical microscopy, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) overcomes the classical trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution. By localizing and tracking individual injected microbubbles (MBs) with sub-wavelength precision, vascular and velocity maps can be generated at the micrometer scale. Here, we present a robust protocol for super-resolution imaging of the brain microvasculature in vivo in rats using a commercial ultrasound platform. This method achieves 12.5 µm spatial resolution, reconstructing the microvascular architecture and providing detailed information on blood flow direction and velocity, greatly enhancing our understanding of cerebral microcirculation. The protocol can be extended to rat disease models, offering a powerful tool for the early diagnosis and treatment of neurovascular diseases.

ABSTRACT:
Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is a super-resolution imaging technique that enables in vivo visualization of the brain's microvascular architecture surpassing the diffraction limit of conventional ultrasound. By detecting and tracking intravenously injected microbubbles as they circulate through cerebral vessels, ULM produces high-resolution maps of vascular density, flow velocity, and backscattered signal amplitude at spatial scales down to 5-10 µm. This protocol presents a complete workflow for performing ULM imaging in rodents, including animal preparation, probe positioning, image acquisition, microbubble injection, and data processing, using a dedicated functional ultrasound platform. Two preparation methods are described, adapted for mice (transcranial) and rats (with cranial windows), followed by detailed instructions for probe alignment and anatomical targeting using an integrated brain atlas. During acquisition, ultrafast ultrasound sequences are synchronized with bolus injections of microbubbles to capture dynamic flow data. Subsequent reconstruction steps involve clutter filtering, image interpolation, microbubble detection, subpixel localization, and trajectory tracking. Outputs include density maps reflecting vessel occupancy, velocity maps revealing flow patterns and directionality, and amplitude maps offering additional contrast for structural interpretation. Representative results illustrate successful acquisition across full coronal planes and highlight common pitfalls such as poor injection quality, motion artifacts, and skull-induced aberration. The protocol is compatible with both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and is particularly suited for investigating cerebrovascular alterations in models of aging, stroke, aneurysm, and neurodegenerative diseases. By combining depth penetration, high spatiotemporal resolution, and label-free vascular imaging, ULM offers a powerful tool for noninvasive brain microcirculation analysis in preclinical models.

TITLE: Roughness Impact of Piezoelectric Dental Scaler on Two Distinct Flowable Composite Filling Materials.
AUTHORS: Agrali Omer Birkan
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 39878953
DOI: 10.3791/67446

ABSTRACT:
Dental ultrasonic scalers are commonly employed in periodontal treatment; however, their ability to roughen tooth surfaces is a worry since roughness may increase plaque production, a key cause of periodontal disease. This research studied the influence of a piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler on the roughness of two distinct flowable composite filling materials. To do this, 10 disc-shaped samples were generated from each of the two flowable composite materials. After standardized polishing, samples were submerged in water for 24 h before the first surface examination using electron microscopy and profilometry. The ultrasonic scaler was applied to a specified location of each sample for 60 s under water cooling and regulated force. Post-scaler surface parameters were again examined. Following the application of the scaler, both composite materials exhibited a notable increase in surface roughness, as determined by profilometry (p < 0.01). Additionally, the observed surface roughness was also qualitatively visualized with scanning electron microscopy. While initial roughness levels were comparable across the two composites (p = 0.143) after scaler application, no substantial discrepancy in surface texture was noticed between them (p = 0.684). The use of a high-power piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler on routinely used flowable composite restorations might generate considerable surface roughness, possibly leading to increased plaque accumulation. Nevertheless, it might be postulated that nanohybrid flowable composite materials having conventional monomer ingredients may demonstrate comparable surface alterations within the limitations of this experiment.

PMID: 40920739
DOI: 10.3791/68385

ABSTRACT:
Examining circadian synaptic plasticity requires housing mice under different lighting conditions (light/dark cycle, LD 12:12, and constant darkness, DD), providing access to running wheels, and sacrificing them at four defined time points within 24 h-at the beginning and middle of the day/subjective day and at the beginning and middle of the night/subjective night. Brains are then properly fixed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The barrel cortex, with its precise somatotopic organization, provides an ideal model for such analysis. To obtain the required brain area, the brains are tangentially cut with a vibratome, and then, sections containing the barrel cortex are selected and embedded in Polybed resin. From the prepared blocks containing the selected barrels, consecutive ultrathin sections are cut. Synaptic density, excitatory and inhibitory, is analysed from electron micrographs using the stereological dissector method. Additionally, TEM images are used for 3D reconstructions of dendritic spines. Changes in the shape of dendritic spines indicate remodeling of neurons during the day. The number of excitatory synapses peaks during sleep (day) in mice, while inhibitory synapses peak during their activity phase (in the middle of the night).

DOI: 10.3791/68534

ABSTRACT:
Demodex mite infestation can cause inflammation of the eyelid margin, and Demodex blepharitis could give rise to a series of ocular conditions in clinical cases. Numerous physicians diagnose ocular infestation of Demodex mites through eyelash epilation and the observation of eyelashes under light microscopy in vitro. However, the presence of residual mites following eyelash removal and the pain associated with the procedure are limitations of standard clinical care. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows clinicians to observe Demodex mites at the eyelid margin in detail without epilation. This technique enables painless analysis that can be completed in <30 min. Despite growing attention being paid to this examination, it may be inaccessible to many ophthalmologists without extensive experience. This paper presents a standard operating procedure for the visualization of Demodex mites at the eyelid margin with IVCM to promote increased adoption of this method in clinical work.

ABSTRACT:
Segmenting tubular structures in dense biological tissues from 3D fluorescence microscopy images is critical to study complex tissue but remains challenging due to image complexity, variability, and quality issues. Here, we introduce an open-source, user-friendly toolbox for end-to-end segmentation of tubular structures in 3D images, accessible to researchers without formal programming training. The toolbox features interactive Jupyter notebooks implementing two simple yet efficient deep learning architectures -- 3D U-Net and 3D U-Net with attention mechanisms -- for precise 3D segmentation of tubular networks. A key innovation is our simulation-based data augmentation strategy, which enhances model performance even with minimal training data (as few as one 3D image). Employing user-provided masks, the protocol generates artificial microscopy images with varying signal-to-noise ratios and simulates realistic imaging artifacts, including uneven staining, point spread function convolution, axial intensity variations, and Poisson and Gaussian noise. The protocol systematically guides users through data augmentation, model training, qualitative and quantitative evaluation on test sets, and inference on new images. We validate the toolbox by analyzing two morphologically distinct tubular networks in mouse liver tissue -- the bile canaliculi and sinusoidal networks -- demonstrating that both architectures perform well, with the attention U-Net slightly outperforming the standard U-Net when trained with augmented data. Our comprehensive toolbox, executable on local Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), high-performance computing clusters, or cloud platforms, contributes to the democratization of advanced image analysis for a broad spectrum of researchers.

TITLE: Three-dimensional Quantification of Intestinal Mucus Using Whole-mount Tissue Imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Mucus plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by facilitating digestion, forming a barrier against microbes, and regulating immune responses within the gut. Its secretion is modulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including microbial infections and inflammation. While traditional methods for mucus analysis rely on relative quantification, such as measuring mucus thickness in histological sections, these approaches provide limited insight into the actual volume and spatial distribution of secreted mucus within the intestinal lumen. Here, we present a detailed methodology for the absolute, three-dimensional quantification of mucus using whole-mount intestinal tissues and multi-photon microscopy. This protocol includes the preparation of ligated intestinal loops, treatment with carbamoylcholine chloride as a stimulus for goblet cell activation, tissue fixation, and staining for imaging. Using multi-photon microscopy, we acquire Z-stacked images of the luminal surface. These are processed in Imaris software to quantify the volume and spatial distribution of secreted mucus. We demonstrate that carbamoylcholine chloride robustly induces mucus secretion in both ileal and colonic tissues within 30 minutes. The secreted mucus appears in a sporadic and discontinuous manner throughout the lumen, underscoring the importance of volumetric analysis over traditional two-dimensional approaches. This protocol enables researchers to obtain absolute quantitative data and visualize mucus distribution in situ, offering a powerful tool for studying intestinal mucus dynamics under physiological and pathological conditions.

ABSTRACT:
Understanding how G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expression affects cell positioning within diverse tissue microenvironments is essential for elucidating immune cell trafficking mechanisms. We present a competitive homing assay designed to study GPCR-mediated T-cell localization to organs expressing their cognate chemoattractant ligands, applicable for both short-term and long-term studies. The approach involves an improved protocol for recombinant murine stem cell virus (MSCV) transduction of T cells to express the GPCR of interest or a control construct, followed by competitive homing in recipient mice. Cell distribution across different organs is analyzed using flow cytometry and/or confocal microscopy. In short-term experiments (10-12 h), confocal microscopy revealed distinct cell localization patterns, including to alveoli, bronchi submucosa, venous sites, and interstitium in the lung, as well as the epithelium lining the trachea, stomach, and uterine horn. In long-term studies (1-7 weeks), flow cytometry provided insights into preferential cell accumulation, revealing dynamic changes and potential maturation or repositioning within tissues over time. This competitive homing assay is a robust tool for studying GPCR-mediated cell positioning, offering valuable insights into tissue-specific distribution and potential applications in immunology and therapeutic research.

ABSTRACT:
Here, we describe the generation of floating cultures of apical-out intestinal organoids from hydrogel-embedded intestinal organoid cultures. Concurrently, floating basal-out organoid cultures are established for direct comparison between apical-out and basal-out organoids. Apical-out and basal-out organoids are subsequently subjected to the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), which is integrated into the newly synthesized DNA during the S-phase of cell division. This incorporation into DNA can be visualized in morphologically intact organoids using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cells labeled with Hoechst33342 and EdU are then quantified in a semiautomatic manner using image analysis software. Calculation of the percentage of EdU-positive cells of the total number of cells allows for the analysis of cell proliferation in three-dimensional (3D) organoids. Despite being used here for the analysis of proliferation in intestinal organoids, the protocol is applicable to the analysis of nucleus-specific stainings of various sorts in other organoids or two-dimensional cell cultures as well.

TITLE: Residue-Free Fabrication of van der Waals Heterostructures of Two-Dimensional Materials.
AUTHORS: Lee Minyoung, Kim Changho, Seol Jae Hun
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 40758609
DOI: 10.3791/68540

ABSTRACT:
In this work, a unique methodology is presented that utilizes van der Waals (vdW) interactions to fabricate residue-free single flakes of two-dimensional (2D) materials, which are subsequently assembled into intricate heterostructures. The approach focuses on ensuring that the flakes are free from any residue that could affect their properties and performance. Evidence from atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirms that the transferred hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flakes exhibit excellent flatness and strain-free characteristics, which are crucial for various applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Furthermore, the pick-up and release processes of a target flake are demonstrated using a residue-free stamp, controlled by the type of applied force at the interface, whether normal or shear. By carefully directing the movement of the residue-free stamp, successful assembly of h-BN/MoS2/h-BN heterostructures is achieved through both bottom-up and top-down stacking processes. Moreover, pre-assembled heterostructures were modularly stacked to create a more complex heterostructure, showcasing the versatility of the proposed methodology. This work not only enables to achieve residue-free single flakes of 2D materials, but also paves the way for improved fabrication techniques in vdW heterostructures.

PMID: 40163409
DOI: 10.3791/67778

ABSTRACT:
Various mechanical methods have been proposed for decontaminating dental implant surfaces with varying success. This in vitro study evaluated the decontamination efficiency of an air abrasion (AA) system with erythritol powder, a polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) ultrasonic tip, and titanium curettes (TIT) and their effects on implant surface topography using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A total of 60 implants were stained with permanent red ink and placed in 3D-printed Class 1A and Class 1B peri-implantitis defects, forming six groups (n=10 per group) based on defect type and treatment protocol. Additionally, one positive and one negative control implant was used. Erythritol powder, PEEK ultrasonic tips, and titanium curettes were applied for 2 min in Class 1A defects and 3 minutes in Class 1B defects. Residual red ink areas were quantified with digital software, and implant surface changes were analyzed using SEM and EDS. None of the methods achieved complete decontamination. However, erythritol powder was significantly the most effective, leaving a residual ink rate of 24% ± 6% (p < 0.001). PEEK ultrasonic tips resulted in 41% ± 4% residual ink, while titanium curettes left 55% ± 3%. Significant differences were observed among all methods. No significant difference in decontamination efficacy was found between Class 1A and Class 1B defects. SEM analysis showed minimal surface damage with erythritol powder and PEEK tips, whereas titanium curettes caused moderate to severe damage. Based on both decontamination efficiency and surface preservation, erythritol powder and PEEK tips are safe and effective options for peri-implantitis treatment, while titanium curettes are less effective and cause considerable surface damage. These findings may assist clinicians in peri-implantitis treatment planning.

TITLE: Extracting the Young's Modulus of Native Murine Pulmonary Basement Membranes from Atomic Force Microscopy derived Force Maps.
AUTHORS: Hartmann Bastian, Nicolau Monica, Reuten Raphael, Clausen-Schaumann Hauke

PMID: 39960171
DOI: 10.3791/67784

ABSTRACT:
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows the characterization of the mechanical properties of a sample with a spatial resolution of several tens of nanometers. Because mammalian cells sense and react to the mechanics of their immediate microenvironment, the characterization of biomechanical properties of tissues with high spatial resolution is crucial for understanding various developmental, homeostatic, and pathological processes. The basement membrane (BM), a roughly 100 - 400 nm thin extracellular matrix (ECM) substructure, plays a significant role in tumor progression and metastasis formation. Although determining Young's modulus of such a thin ECM substructure is challenging, biomechanical data of the BM provides fundamental new insights into how the BM affects cell behavior and, in addition, offers valuable diagnostic potential. Here, we present a visualized protocol for assessing BM mechanics in murine lung tissue, which is one of the major organs prone to metastasis. We describe an efficient workflow for determining the Young's modulus of the BM, which is located between the endothelial and epithelial cell layers in lung tissue. The step-by-step instructions comprise murine lung tissue freezing, cryosectioning, and AFM force-map recording on tissue sections. Additionally, we provide a semi-automatic data analysis procedure using the CANTER Processing Toolbox, an in-house developed user-friendly AFM data analysis software. This tool enables automatic loading of recorded force maps, conversion of force versus piezo-extension curves to force versus indentation curves, computation of Young's moduli, and generation of Young's modulus maps. Finally, it shows how to determine and isolate Young's modulus values derived from the pulmonary BM through the use of a spatial filtering tool.

ABSTRACT:
This study reports the application and preliminary experience of a three-dimensional (3D) fluorescent digital external-viewing microscope platform using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography in subinguinal varicocelectomy and explores its impact on surgical outcomes and postoperative recovery. Twenty-six microscope-assisted subinguinal varicocelectomy procedures were performed on 23 patients between September 1, 2024, and October 25, 2024, using this technology. During each surgery, 3 mL of ICG dye was administered via peripheral intravenous injection for angiography. Under fluorescence mode, the arterial and venous structures were visualized; the arteries were marked and preserved, and the veins were ligated. All operations were completed successfully, with an average operative time of 52.65 ± 8.48 min per procedure. The mean time from ICG injection to arterial fluorescence was 45.88 ± 2.10 s, and the mean time to venous fluorescence was 81.61 ± 3.61 s. On average, 2.1 ± 0.84 arteries (range 1-4) were preserved per patient, and several capillary reticular arteries were observed in most patients' spermatic vessels. The 3D fluorescent digital external microscope platform using ICG angiography demonstrates promising potential in subinguinal varicocelectomy. It may become a reliable adjunctive technique in microscope-assisted varicocelectomy, aiding surgeons in accurately identifying and locating arterial branches at all levels, thereby preventing arterial injury during surgery.

ABSTRACT:
Actin cytoskeleton-based materials are widely investigated as model cellular materials to elucidate physical mechanisms of cell mechanics, such as shape regulation and force production, as well as intriguing soft polymeric materials. In this method, we detail creating actin-based assemblies in vitro using purified protein for fluorescence microscopy studies. We polymerize long actin filaments in a sample chamber and use a polymer depletant to crowd filaments into a two-dimensional (2D)-entangled network against a surface passivated with a surfactant layer. Adding skeletal muscle myosin II filaments in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) induces contraction of the actin network. By bundling actin filaments with a crosslinker, we tune the contractility of the assembly, transitioning from a material that buckles to a material that slides at the microscale. By reducing the length of the actin filaments through co-polymerizing actin in the presence of capping protein, we tune the material from being a 2D network to a liquid crystal. Cross-linking of dispersed short actin filaments results in three-dimensional (3D) liquid crystal droplet formation.

ABSTRACT:
Retinal organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells are intricate 3D structures that mimic the human retina, offering a powerful platform for studying retinal development, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic strategies. Moreover, as they are derived from patients, they are becoming increasingly popular as they hold great promise as a tool for personalized medicine. Unlike conventional 2D cell cultures, retinal organoids preserve the native 3D architecture of the retina, allowing for a more realistic representation and enabling more physiologically relevant studies. However, their structural complexity, high cellular density, and diverse composition present significant challenges for characterization. To address these challenges and enhance our understanding of retinal organoid maturation while preserving the 3D context, we combined optical clearing methods with immunolabeling to visualize the entire structure of whole-mount organoids with confocal microscopy. For this, we employed a clearing method compatible with low- and high-numerical-aperture objectives, facilitating full-volume imaging and capturing certain regions of interest with cellular resolution. Using this approach, we identified the morphology and distribution in 3D of the three main neuron paths responsible for the visual information transmission: cone and rod photoreceptors, bipolar and ganglion cells. Our findings shed more light on the visualization techniques to address the spatial organization of retinal cells within the organoid.

PMID: 40095951
DOI: 10.3791/67745

ABSTRACT:
The evaluation of direct interaction between pathogens and immune receptors usually involves sophisticated techniques or implies the use of transgenic strains and genetically engineered cells. Here, an alternative method to detect biochemical interaction between the macrophage microbial sensor SLAMF1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is described. Two technical approaches employing flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were developed. Total cell protein extracts from human macrophages were generated, then incubated with whole cells of M. tuberculosis (WCMtb) or M. tuberculosis antigens (Mtb Ags) overnight at 4 °C and finally cross-linked using formaldehyde/glycine/ethylene glycol bis (succinimidyl succinate) treatment. SLAMF1 interaction with WCMtb by flow cytometry was detected with a PE-specific anti-SLAMF1 antibody. The existence of interaction by fluorescence microscopy was performed by attaching Rhodamine-PE stained Mtb Ags to poly-D-lysine coated slides, which were incubated with the total protein extract from monocyte-derived macrophages. After cross-linking treatment, SLAMF1 was visualized using primary (anti-SLAMF1) and secondary (Alexa Fluor 488) antibodies. The assays provided a strong biochemical tool to measure pathogen-immunoreceptor interactions, overcoming the difficulties associated with transgenic cell lines and protein gene expression modulation experiments.

ABSTRACT:
Both DNA replication and RNA transcription utilize genomic DNA as their template, necessitating spatial and temporal separation of these processes. Conflicts between the replication and transcription machinery, termed transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), pose a considerable risk to genome stability, a critical factor in cancer development. While several factors regulating these collisions have been identified, pinpointing primary causes remains difficult due to limited tools for direct visualization and clear interpretation. In this study, we directly visualize TRCs using a proximity ligation assay (PLA), leveraging antibodies specific to PCNA and phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II. This approach allows precise measurement of TRCs between replication and transcription processes mediated by RNA polymerase II. The method is further enhanced through DNA primers conjugated covalently to these antibodies, coupled with PCR amplification using fluorescent probes, providing a highly sensitive and specific means of detecting endogenous TRCs. Fluorescence microscopy enables the visualization of these conflicts, offering a powerful tool to study genome instability mechanisms associated with cancer. This technique addresses the gap in direct TRC visualization, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis and understanding of the underlying processes driving genome instability in cells.

PMID: 40489399
DOI: 10.3791/68158

ABSTRACT:
With increasing the current density and decreasing the size of chips electromigration becomes more and more important. Electromigration is the movement of atoms in an electrically conductive material caused by current flowing. For aluminum and copper the electromigration parameters and their dependencies have been investigated by a multitude of people and methods. For other materials, this is not the case. Electromigration experiments often use very long times to stress the lines under test in the median to failure experiments. These experiments only give surface-level information about electromigration. More sophisticated methods look at the microscopic or nanoscale effects and influences. Usually, expensive equipment such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM), synchrotrons, or X-ray microtomography are used for these investigations. A workflow enabling the investigation of electromigration on the microscopic scale by using a laser scanning microscope has been developed. With this laser scanning technique, it is possible to achieve results with slightly less accuracy than SEM but with much less effort in preparing the samples. With the electromigrated volume being known, the same procedures as with the electromigrated volumes determined via SEM can be used to calculate electromigration parameters. By varying different experimental variables, a multitude of information about electromigration can be achieved. In this work determining the length for the onset of electromigration is shown.

ABSTRACT:
Real-time dynamic monitoring of acupuncture effects is crucial for elucidating its biological mechanisms, yet traditional histological methods fail to capture transient responses in the live microenvironment. Here, we established a methodological framework based on in vivo laser confocal imaging, enabling high-resolution, real-time observation of morphological changes in local tissues following acupuncture intervention. After intravenous injection of sodium fluorescein in rats, dynamic alterations in microcirculation and extracellular matrix (e.g., collagen fiber arrangement) were tracked during acupuncture. The results demonstrated that this method clearly distinguished immediate (e.g., vasodilation) and delayed (e.g., inflammatory response) tissue reactions induced by acupuncture, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 µm and a temporal resolution of 3.5 fps. Subsequent quantitative analysis enabled objective measurement of morphological parameters. This protocol, described in this study, provides a visualization tool for in vivo studies of acupuncture mechanisms and serves as a technical reference for evaluating the effects of other physical stimuli (e.g., moxibustion).

ABSTRACT:
Spatial metabolomics is a rapidly evolving field to map the distribution of metabolites within tissues, organs, and even single cells. This approach provides contextual metabolic information, which is critical for understanding the biochemical heterogeneity of biological systems. Mid-infrared (MIR) imaging and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) have emerged as powerful approaches for spatial metabolomics, each offering unique and complementary advantages. In this study, we present a workflow for performing MIR imaging and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MSI (MALDI-MSI) on the same tissue section, encompassing experimental procedures, imaging co-registration, data integration, and bioinformatics analysis. MIR imaging is employed as the upstream modality, allowing for non-destructive biochemical analysis of tissues. Subsequently, a matrix is deposited in the tissue for MALDI-MSI, guided by the spatial information obtained from MIR imaging. Images are integrated following co-registration, enabling multi-modal spatial metabolomics analysis using advanced bioinformatics tools such as Seurat. The integration of MIR imaging and MSI represents a transformative advancement in spatial metabolomics, offering unprecedented opportunities to explore the spatial and chemical complexity of metabolic processes in both health and disease. This multi-modal approach holds significant potential for driving innovations in biomarker discovery, disease diagnostics, and therapeutic development.

ABSTRACT:
Imaging microcapillary networks of the skin in humans using nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) has underscored the importance of microcirculation as a target organ system in critical systemic illnesses. Nailfold capillaroscopy is applied clinically to detect peripheral microvascular dysfunction and abnormalities in a range of systemic conditions, including rheumatic, cardiac, ocular (e.g., glaucoma), and endocrine disorders (e.g., hypertension and diabetes mellitus). NFC is useful not only in detecting peripheral systemic microvasculature disruption but also in assessing drug efficacy. However, translating clinical NFC findings to animal disease models can be challenging. Detecting microvascular dysfunction or abnormalities in animals is often invasive (e.g., endoscopic), carried out ex vivo (e.g., post-mortem imaging of tissues), or expensive, requiring specialized equipment such as those used in microcomputed tomography and photoacoustic imaging techniques. Developing quick, non-invasive, and inexpensive techniques to image peripheral microvasculature in animal models of disease is warranted to decrease research expenses and increase translatability to the clinic. Capillaroscopy has previously been used to visualize the nailfold microvasculature in animal models, including in guinea pigs and mice, thus demonstrating the capability of capillaroscopy as a non-invasive imaging tool in animal models. This study provides a protocol that applies capillaroscopy to a mouse nailbed, allowing researchers to easily and inexpensively assess the morphology of its microvasculature. Representative images of typical nailbed microvascular architecture in wild-type mice using two commonly used laboratory strains, SV129/S6 and C57/B6J, are provided. Further studies using this method are essential for applying nailbed capillaroscopy to a wide range of mouse disease models with peripheral microvascular abnormalities.

ABSTRACT:
Spider silks are renowned for their mechanical properties, with hallmark high strength, high extensibility, or a combination of these leading to high toughness. A typical female orb-weaving spider produces seven different types of silk, each typically spun from type-specific protein(s) and mechanically tailored for a distinct survival function. Recombinant spider silk production provides a promising route to obtain these materials, circumventing challenges in obtaining large quantities of natural silks and providing advantages in allowing for protein customization, for example, through site-directed mutagenesis or fusion protein construction. In the presented protocol, we outline a methodology for evaluating protein suitability for spinning through both hand-drawing and wet-spinning approaches. Starting with a suitably purified lyophilized protein powder, methods for optimizing the initial solubilized protein state to provide a high-concentration "spinning dope" state are detailed. Next, hand-drawing and wet-spinning approaches are compared, including a discussion on methods to modulate fiber behavior using a post-spin draw as part of the spinning process. A typical workflow to characterize the resulting silk fibers and make a decision on which spinning conditions are most likely to be fruitful is then detailed, including optical microscopy to evaluate fiber diameter and its uniformity; polarized light microscopy to estimate the degree of (supra)molecular alignment being achieved within the fiber; tensile testing to evaluate strength, extensibility, Young's modulus, and toughness; and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectromicroscopy to evaluate protein secondary structuring within the fiber. This protocol has proven suitable for several different recombinant spider silk proteins based on repetitive and non-repetitive domains of aciniform (wrapping) silk; pyriform silk; and fusion proteins comprising aciniform, pyriform, and/or major ampullate (dragline) silk. Broader applicability is provided through several highlighted steps at which conditions and parameters may be varied to suit the behavior of an individual protein and to achieve differences in functional outcome.

ABSTRACT:
Electroporation is a promising technology utilizing electrical pulses for macromolecule delivery and soft-tissue ablation, with applications that include next-generation prophylactics and the treatment of genetic diseases such as cancer. This study demonstrates a high-throughput capable 3D tissue culture model for quantification of the reversible and irreversible electroporation thresholds for a given electroporation protocol. By using a non-uniform electric field and analyzing the spatial distribution of transfected cells, both reversible and irreversible thresholds can be identified within a single sample, increasing the efficiency at which electroporation protocols can be characterized, especially for in vivo translation. To show this capability, 3D tissue mimics containing HEK293 cells were transfected using a ring and pin electrode to deliver a GFP-encoding plasmid. Electroporation thresholds were then derived based on fluorescent microscopy images of the transfected samples. This model demonstrates potential for use as a means for high-throughput evaluation of electroporation protocols, a key advantage over current methods to evaluate these thresholds, which tend to be time-intensive and are less representative of in vivo conditions.

ABSTRACT:
The biological impact of microplastic pollution in human food and water sources is largely unknown, and drinking water sources are not exempt from this microplastic contamination. Here, we demonstrate a streamlined approach for capturing, quantifying, and identifying microplastics in drinking water. We present an analytical workflow termed the Silicon Nanomembrane Analysis Pipeline (SNAP) that takes advantage of novel Silicon nitride nanomembranes that enable a significant "concentration factor," which consolidates suspended particles into a planarized observation area for individuated, quantifiable, and multimodal particle analysis on the same substrate. SNAP's primary advantages derive from its use of ultrathin, Silicon nitride-based membranes housed in conventionally sized filter disks, enabling the direct capture and analysis of polymeric MPs on a non-polymeric background. Drinking water samples sourced in the Rochester, NY region, were collected from residential tap sources and analyzed using SNAP. Particles in each sample were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and various identified constituents were quantified in proportion to the total captured particles.

ABSTRACT:
Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), the spread of cancer cells into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled leptomeninges, is a rare yet devastating complication of advanced solid tumors. Patients with LM often have a poor prognosis, with survival measured in weeks to months. Developing in vivo models that accurately replicate the complexities of LM is essential for understanding its cellular and pathological mechanisms and evaluating potential therapies. Murine LM models are typically created through intra-cardiac, carotid artery, or cisterna magna injection of tumor cells. However, intra-cardiac or carotid injections often result in substantial extracranial and brain tumor burden, complicating bioluminescent imaging and leading to mortality unrelated to LM. Meanwhile, conventional cisterna magna injection requires invasive procedures, such as skin incision and muscle dissection, making it both traumatic and resource intensive. Here, we describe a minimally invasive procedure for tumor cell injection into the leptomeningeal space through the cisterna magna without the need for a skin incision. This approach reduces extracranial tumor formation, minimizes surgical trauma, and shortens the time and postoperative care required compared to other surgical methods. Importantly, it consistently induces LM with minimal brain parenchyma infiltration, as confirmed by two-photon microscopy and histological analysis. This streamlined approach offers an efficient and reliable model for studying LM in preclinical research.

TITLE: Overexpressing and Purifying a Toxic Nuclease from Escherichia coli.
AUTHORS: Daquilanea Erik J, Frazier Meredith N

PMID: 40952958
DOI: 10.3791/68577

ABSTRACT:
Escherichia coli has been widely employed as an expression system to produce recombinant proteins. Yet some types of recombinant proteins, such as nucleases, can be difficult to overexpress recombinantly in E. coli due to their enzymatic activity on cellular DNA or RNA. Such toxic effects can lead to slow growth and poor protein yields. One such example is the endoribonuclease Nsp15 from coronaviruses: yields of wild-type (WT) gamma-coronavirus Nsp15 are much lower than catalytically inactive Nsp15. To address this issue, we have employed the use of C41(DE3) cells and same-day single colony starter cultures to help reduce toxicity. Recombinant Nsp15 containing an N-terminal 6xHis-tag was overexpressed and purified using cobalt-based affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The resulting yields of purified protein are sufficient for biochemical assays and cryo-electron microscopy structural studies. This approach has proven effective in mitigating the toxic effects and achieving satisfactory protein yields for further research analysis.

ABSTRACT:
Caenorhabditis elegans has become one of the most widely studied and best-understood animal models in biology. Three features are key to C. elegans' success as a model organism: its invariant cell lineage, transparency, and genetic tractability. These render it ideal for a diverse range of microscopy-based studies directly in vivo. Live C. elegans larvae and adults often need to be immobilized during image acquisition. Traditional immobilization methods adversely affect animal development, especially in time-lapse imaging applications. Here, a detailed setup and operation protocol for a novel microfluidic imaging method is introduced, which addresses the limitations associated with traditional agar-pad-based immobilization and other microfluidic strategies. This approach enables simultaneous live imaging across various larval stages while preserving worm orientation and identity over time. To achieve this, a microfluidic trap channel array is employed, with its geometry precisely designed to maintain a stable worm orientation while accommodating growth and molting. Immobilization is facilitated by an active hydraulic valve that applies pressure to secure worms against the cover glass solely during image acquisition. This design allows high-resolution imaging with minimal effects on worm viability or developmental timing.

PMID: 40293975
DOI: 10.3791/66077

ABSTRACT:
This protocol outlines a procedure for knocking out the RIP1 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 in the human monocyte U937 cell line. The method utilizes designated guide RNA plasmids and lentiviral packaging plasmids to achieve RIP1 gene knockout. The protocol addresses challenges and improvements to traditional CRISPR methods, enabling its replication for future cell death studies. The resulting mutant cells can be used to investigate mechanistic changes in cell death, where functional RIP1 proteins would otherwise play a role. Viability assays demonstrated a significant reduction in cell death in knockout cells following necroptosis induction. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a marked decrease in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in knockout cells under the same conditions. Together, these functional assays confirm the loss of RIP1 protein. Optimized for use with U937 human monocytes, this procedure may also be adapted to target other key cell death regulators, yielding functional, non-lethal mutants. Potential pitfalls are addressed throughout to provide insights into challenges that may arise during mutant generation.

ABSTRACT:
Prostate cancer remains one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting men worldwide, making early detection and advancements in precision medicine crucial for effective intervention and treatment. A standardized protocol is presented for utilizing stimulated Raman histology (SRH) with integrated artificial intelligence (AI) in prostate cancer detection, offering significant advancements over conventional histopathological methods. SRH provides these advancements by enhancing efficiency through near-real-time, label-free imaging of fresh, unstained tissues, thereby eliminating the delays associated with traditional biopsy analysis. By using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy to detect the specific vibrational frequencies of CH2 bonds associated with lipids and CH3 bonds linked to proteins and DNA, cancerous and benign tissues in prostate biopsies can be differentiated. The AI model further enhances diagnostic precision, achieving 98.6% accuracy in identifying prostate cancer. The protocol outlines essential steps for sample preparation, imaging, and data analysis, facilitating improved biobanking processes and enabling downstream applications, such as transcriptomics and xenograft studies. This approach accelerates the diagnostic workflow and shows promise for intraoperative applications, potentially aiding surgeons in identifying positive margins intraoperatively. Additionally, the ability to re-scan and adjust cancer-to-tissue ratios allows for a more tailored analysis of biopsy samples, enhancing tumor detection in unprocessed tissues. Further research and validation are necessary for the widespread adoption of SRH in clinical practice.

TITLE: A GFP Complementation-based Dual-expression System for Assessing Cell-Cell Contact Mediated by Cytonemes in Live Drosophila Wing Imaginal Discs.
AUTHORS: Joseph Mathieu, Hipfner David R
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 40920616
DOI: 10.3791/68411

ABSTRACT:
Embryonic tissue growth and patterning are largely controlled by signals exchanged locally between cell populations within the tissues themselves. Cytonemes are a type of signaling filopodia first identified in Drosophila that connect and mediate exchange between signal-producing and signal-receiving cells. In the developing Drosophila wing imaginal disc, cytonemes are involved in signal exchange between distinct populations of cells within the disc proper (DP) epithelium, which will form the adult wing, as well as between DP cells and cells in adjacent disc-associated tissues. Cytonemes synapse with target cells to form intimate membrane contacts. Here, we present a protocol for quantifying cytoneme-mediated contact between DP cells and cells of the adjacent peripodial membrane (PerM) epithelium, which is separated from the DP cells by the disc lumen, using a GFP reconstitution approach in live wing discs. Using the GAL4-UAS and LexA-LexAop systems, complementary fragments of split-GFP (spGFP1-10, spGFP11), each fused to the transmembrane domain of CD4, are expressed on either side of the disc lumen. Imaging of reconstituted GFP fluorescence in live wing disc preparations by confocal microscopy is then used to generate image stacks from which reconstituted GFP fluorescence can be localized and quantified. Using this system it is possible to co-express protein-coding or RNA interference transgenes in either cytoneme-producing or target cells to gauge their effect on DP-PerM cell contacts. This system, easily adaptable to other tissues, thus enables the identification of factors important for cytoneme formation or function.

ABSTRACT:
Retinal Müller cells (RMCs) play a crucial role in providing structural support and regulating various functions within the retina. As a core component of the retinal microenvironment, RMCs perform several vital functions. Through their abundant ion channels, ligands, receptors, transmembrane transporters, and enzyme systems, these cells contribute to neurotransmitter and trophic factor secretion, regulate retinal metabolism, and maintain water-ion homeostasis. Notably, RMCs have recently been identified as a significant source of endogenous retinal regenerative stem cells, offering novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases. Therefore, studying RMCs is essential for understanding the pathological mechanisms underlying retinal disorders. This study systematically establishes a standardized experimental protocol that includes trypsin digestion and purification of primary RMCs, morphological observation using inverted optical microscopy and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, specific protein identification through immunofluorescence staining, and cell purity analysis via flow cytometry. This protocol serves as a valuable reference for both basic research and clinical applications related to RMCs, supporting the exploration of their mechanisms in retinal diseases and advancing the development of therapeutic strategies.

ABSTRACT:
High salt intake is a major risk factor for hypertension, and its underlying mechanism may be closely linked to extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by gut microbiota. These EVs, produced by gut microbiota, carry various bioactive components that may play a crucial role in the development of hypertension induced by a high-salt diet (HSD). To investigate this mechanism, we developed an efficient extraction method based on density gradient centrifugation to isolate EVs from the gut microbiota of salt-sensitive rats fed an HSD. Through particle size analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) detection, we identified the gradient distribution of gut microbiota EVs and achieved precise extraction. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to analyze the origin and compositional differences of EVs between the normal and HSD groups, revealing the impact of high salt intake on the genetic characteristics of gut microbiota EVs. This study provides valuable tools and scientific insights into the gut microbiota mechanisms underlying salt-induced hypertension and offers new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of related diseases.

TITLE: Synthesis of Stimuli-responsive Nanogels using Aqueous One-step Crosslinking and Co-nanopolymerization.
AUTHORS: Dabas Rupali, Blagojevic Luka, Kamaly Nazila
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 39927646
DOI: 10.3791/63981

ABSTRACT:
Nanogels consisting of crosslinked-polymeric nanoparticles have been developed for the delivery of numerous chemical and biological therapeutics, owing to their versatile bottom-up synthesis and biocompatibility. While various methods have been employed for nanogel synthesis to date, very few have achieved it without the use of harsh organic solvents or high temperatures that can damage the integrity of the biological payload. In contrast, the methodology presented here accomplishes the synthesis of sub-100 nm sized, protein-loaded nanogels using mild reaction conditions. Here, we present a method for the non-covalent encapsulation of protein-based payloads within nano-gels that were synthesized using an aqueous-based, single-step, crosslinking copolymerization technique. In this technique, we initially electrostatically bind a protein-based payload to a cationic quaternary ammonium monomer and simultaneously cross-link and co-polymerize it using ammonium persulfate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine to form nanogels that entrap the protein payload. The size and polydispersity index of the nanogels is determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS), while the surface morphology is assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mass of protein entrapped within nanogels is determined by calculating the encapsulation efficiency. Furthermore, the controlled-release ability of the nanogels via the gradual degradation of redox-responsive structural elements is also assessed in bioreduction assays. We provide examples of nanoparticle optimization data to demonstrate all caveats of nanogel synthesis and characterization using this technique. In general, uniformly sized nanogels were obtained with an average size of 57 nm and a polydispersity index value of 0.093. A high encapsulation efficiency of 76% was achieved. Furthermore, the nanogels exhibited controlled release of up to 86% of the encapsulated protein by gradual degradation of novel redox-responsive components in the presence of glutathione over 48 h.

DOI: 10.3791/69215

ABSTRACT:
Silicon clathrates (SiCL) are a class of cage-structured materials with tuneable optoelectronic properties, offering significant potential for photovoltaic applications. Among them, type II SiCL (NaxSi136) are particularly attractive due to their unique ability to reversibly accommodate guest atoms without compromising the crystal structure. Traditional synthesis methods, such as synthesis under extreme pressure or fabrication under glove boxes, although essential for probing the intrinsic properties of clathrates under well-controlled conditions, are not well-suited for scaling up and are often energy-intensive and require specialized equipment. To overcome these limitations, a scalable, glovebox-free synthesis method based on two thermal decomposition steps was developed to produce silicon clathrate films. Post-synthesis treatment, including thermal pressing and reactive ion etching, was employed to enhance the electrical properties of the material. Phase formation and crystallinity are confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy; morphology is assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM); and optoelectronic properties are evaluated by photoluminescence. This approach provides a reproducible and scalable route to fabricate type II silicon clathrate films, with promising potential for integration into optoelectronic devices.

AUTHORS: Han Yaning, Wei Pengfei
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 41115131
DOI: 10.3791/68668

ABSTRACT:
Animals engage with their natural environment through rich and dynamic brain activity. Understanding how neural population dynamics encode naturalistic behavior remains a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. Recent advances in deep learning-based behavior analysis and miniature fluorescence imaging have opened new avenues for investigating how the brain encodes natural behavior. Here, this study presents an integrated experimental and computational framework that combines the Social Behavior Atlas (SBeA), miniature Two-Photon Microscopy (mTPM), and Consistent EmBeddings of high-dimensional Recordings using Auxiliary variables (CEBRA) to decode complex behaviors from brain dynamics. This study uses naturalistic social interactions between freely moving mice as a model system, enabling high-resolution behavioral annotation alongside simultaneous neural imaging. This framework includes precise behavioral pose estimation, synchronized dual-mouse tracking, neural embedding alignment, and decoding of behavioral features directly from neural principal components. This study demonstrates that this approach achieves a decoding precision of 3. ± 1.5 pixels for posture and 89 ± 6% accuracy for motif decoding across animals, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. This method provides a powerful tool for exploring how brain activity reflects structured behavioral states, and it lays the groundwork for future studies of naturalistic neural coding principles.

ABSTRACT:
This study investigates the preparation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers through electrospinning to create highly porous and strong materials for applications in water purification, electrocatalysis, and biomedicine. The uniformly white PAN nanofiber mats were cut into 2 cm x 2 cm coupons to ensure consistency. After electrospinning, these nanofibers were coated with an electroactive polymer (EAP) using chemical vapor deposition, with iron (III) chloride (FeCl3) serving as an oxidant for polymerizing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The study examined the impact of different FeCl3 concentrations on PEDOT deposition on the PAN coupons. PEDOT deposition led to an increase in coupon weight. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed increases in the diameter of the nanofibers treated with increasing FeCl3 oxidant concentration, although higher FeCl3 concentrations caused inter-fiber bridging, implying a concomitant decrease in inter-fiber spacing. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to confirm the presence of Fe, Cl, and S in the nanofibers, with sulfur content rising with FeCl3 concentration used, suggesting increased PEDOT deposition efficiency with increasing oxidant concentration. Mechanical testing showed that PEDOT-coated PAN fibers had improved tensile strength and toughness in the hydrated state compared to pure PAN nanofibers. These results highlight the crucial role of FeCl3 concentration in influencing the morphology and properties of PAN-PEDOT composites, enhancing their suitability for applications such as water purification, tissue engineering, biosensing, catalysis, and energy storage.

TITLE: Herbal Munziq Ameliorates Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting Inflammation.

ABSTRACT:
The objective of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects of Munziq on abnormal body fluid myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) and its underlying mechanism.Normal rats and rats with abnormal body fluid (ABF) were pre-treated with Munziq for 21 days. Following this, MIRI models were established. Histopathological changes and myocardial ultrastructure changes were observed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE)staining and transmission electron microscopy to observe pathological manifestations of myocardial injury. Serum CK-MB, cTn-T, and ICAM-1 levels were detected by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to observe myocardial injury-related markers. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum and myocardial tissue were also detected by ELISA to observe the anti-inflammatory effect. The expression levels of NF-κB signaling pathway-related proteins NIK, IKKα, Pikα, and p65 were detected by Western blot analysis. The results showed that myocardial injury in the ABF MIRI group was more severe compared to the control MIRI group. Munziq pretreatment has the potential to mitigate the pathological changes induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury and could protect cardiac function. Protein levels of the NF-κB pathway and downstream effectors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly up-regulated in the MIRI group while down-regulated in the Munziq group. Interestingly, there was more activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and higher levels of downstream inflammatory cytokines in the ABF MIRI group. The results suggest that MIRI was more severe in ABF. Munziq has cardioprotective effects in ischemia and reperfusion injury. This protective effect may be acted by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway.

ABSTRACT:
The reduction of autophagy in cartilage tissue is closely linked to the development of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), yet the mechanisms by which Hydroxyl safflower yellow A (HSYA) exerts protective effects remain incompletely understood. In this study, human KOA chondrocytes were isolated and assigned to different treatment groups, including normal control, blank model, HSYA, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) inhibitor, autophagy inducer, HSYA combined with HIF-1α inhibitor, and HSYA combined with autophagy inducer. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) were quantified by ELISA, protein expression of HIF-1α, BNIP3, and autophagy-related markers was examined by Western blotting, and autophagic vesicles in mitochondria were evaluated using monodansylcadaverine staining and transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the normal control, the blank model group showed significantly increased levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and HIF-1α, accompanied by higher apoptosis rates, reduced proliferation, and downregulation of autophagy-related proteins (P < 0.05). Treatment with HSYA, HIF-1α inhibitor, or autophagy inducer significantly upregulated autophagy-related protein expression and reduced inflammatory cytokine levels. Moreover, HSYA combined with HIF-1α inhibitor or autophagy inducer produced the most pronounced effects, with marked reductions in cytokine release and apoptosis, along with enhanced chondrocyte proliferation and mitochondrial autophagic vesicle formation (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that HSYA exerts chondroprotective effects in KOA, at least in part, through inhibition of the HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathway, thereby promoting autophagy and attenuating inflammatory injury in chondrocytes.

ABSTRACT:
Yangjing Zhongyu Decoction (YZD), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has been suggested to improve ovarian function and fertility outcomes, but standardized clinical evidence remains limited. This study evaluated the effects of YZD in women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) undergoing IVF/ICSI-ET, alongside mechanistic validation in a rat model of premature ovarian failure (POF). In the clinical trial, DOR patients received either the standard GnRH antagonist protocol alone or in combination with YZD. Baseline characteristics between groups were comparable, and the YZD group showed higher numbers of retrieved oocytes and high-quality embryos, as well as improved traditional Chinese medicine syndrome scores. In parallel, POF was induced in rats, and animals treated with YZD exhibited improved estrous cyclicity, restoration of serum estradiol levels, reduction of follicle-stimulating hormone, and healthier ovarian histology. Electron microscopy revealed that YZD reduced excessive autophagosome formation and lipid accumulation in ovarian cells, suggesting regulation of the autophagy-lipid metabolism axis. Together, these findings indicate that YZD enhances ovarian reserve function, improves embryo development, and may increase pregnancy potential in women with DOR. This standardized protocol provides a reproducible framework for integrating YZD into assisted reproductive technology cycles, supporting its translational potential in clinical reproductive medicine.

TITLE: An Appetitive Spatial Working Memory Task for Mice in a Semi-Automated 8-Arm Radial Maze, Reducing Fearful Memory Association in the Maze.
AUTHORS: Shimizu Takahiro, Nayar Stuart G, Ransom Bruce R, Richardson William D
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 40824931
DOI: 10.3791/66456

ABSTRACT:
This method paper details a protocol to test spatial working memory in mice using a semi-automated radial 8-arm maze (RAM). The RAM is a partially enclosed apparatus with 8 horizontal, equally spaced arms radiating from a central hub, from which access to each arm can be controlled individually by servo-controlled motorized doors. Animals start in the central hub and are allowed to explore the maze for a food reward at the end of each arm or selected arm. The RAM task was originally designed for rats, but we have adapted the protocol for mice, for example, by including more habituation steps. In our protocol, all arms are initially baited with sweetened condensed milk, and mice are admitted sequentially into four pseudo-randomly selected arms to collect the rewards ("forced run") before opening all doors together to allow the mice to run freely and find the remaining four rewards ("free run"). A 5 s delay is introduced between the forced and free runs to challenge working memory; an error is recorded if the mouse enters any previously visited arm during the free run. The task is complete when all rewards are recovered. After 6 days of habituation and 9 days of maze training, male C57BL/6 mice regularly achieve ≥ 80% daily success rate score, defined as 4/(4+E), where E is the number of errors. This semi-automated task could, in principle, be combined with in vivo monitoring methods such as electrophysiology, multiple-photon microscopy, or calcium imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) is an autologous matrix rich in platelets, leukocytes, and growth factors that support tissue regeneration. Enhancing its structural and biological properties through biomaterial supplementation may improve clinical outcomes. This study evaluated the effects of adding hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen to PRF on growth factor release and mechanical strength. In the current study, venous blood samples were collected from 20 healthy volunteers (seven tubes per participant). The tubes were used for complete blood count analysis, obtaining pure PRF and supplemented PRF with HA (HA-PRF) and collagen (COL-PRF), mechanical testing, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of pure PRF, HA-PRF, and COL-PRF, respectively. All samples were centrifuged at 708 x g for 12 min. Growth factor levels were measured at 24 h and 72 h via ELISA. PRF membranes were also subjected to tensile and elongation testing using a testometric device. At 72 h, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) levels were significantly higher in HA-PRF and COL-PRF than in controls. Other growth factors showed no significant differences. Mechanical testing revealed greater elongation and tensile strength in the COL-PRF group compared to both HA-PRF and control. These findings suggest that HA and collagen enhance PRF's mechanical performance. In particular, collagen improves structural durability, potentially extending PRF's resorption time. This supports its application as a membrane substitute in bone augmentation procedures.

ABSTRACT:
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the U.S. Organoid models of solid tumors have been shown to faithfully recapitulate aspects of cancer progression such as proliferation and invasion. Although patient-derived organoids and patient-derived xenograft organoids are pathophysiologically relevant, they are costly to propagate, difficult to manipulate, and comprised primarily of the most proliferative cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME). These limitations prevent their use for elucidating cellular mechanisms of disease progression that depend upon tumor-associated stromal cells which are found within the TME and known to contribute to metastasis and therapy resistance. Here, we report on methods for cultivating epithelial-stromal multicellular 3D cultures. The advantages of these methods include a cost-effective system for rapidly generating organoid-like 3D cultures within scaffold-free environments that can be used to track invasion at single-cell resolution within hydrogel scaffolds. Specifically, we demonstrate how to generate these heteromulticellular 3D cultures using BT-474 breast cancer cells in combination with fibroblasts (BJ-5ta), monocyte-like cells (THP-1), and/or endothelial cells (EA.hy926). Additionally, differential fluorescent labeling of cell populations enables time-lapse microscopy to define 3D culture assembly and invasion dynamics. Notably, the addition of any two stromal cell combinations to 3D cultures of BT-474 cells significantly reduces circularity of the 3D cultures, consistent with the presence of organoid-like or secondary spheroid structures. In tracker dye experiments, fibroblasts and endothelial cells co-localize in the peripheral organoid-like protrusions and are spatially segregated from the primary BT-474 spheroid. Finally, heteromulticellular 3D cultures of BT-474 cells have increased hydrogel invasion capacity. Since we observed these protrusive structures in heteromulticellular 3D cultures of both non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, this work provides an efficient and reproducible method for generating organoid-like 3D cultures in a scaffold-free environment for subsequent analyses of phenotypes associated with solid tumor progression.

ABSTRACT:
Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is a label-free optical imaging technique that can discern molecular components such as lipids and proteins at subcellular spatial resolution without histologic staining. Here, we present a protocol for labeling cells and training AI models for automated cell segmentation on SRH images acquired intra-operatively from neurosurgical cases. We describe steps to enable single-cell spatial analysis on SRH using ELUCIDATE, a web-based SRH cell annotation tool, and DetectSRH Python library.

ABSTRACT:
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are pivotal in the immune response, trapping and neutralizing pathogens. The process of NET formation, or NETosis, is a critical innate immune response mechanism implicated in diverse physiological and pathological processes, including infections, chronic inflammation, and cancer. Accurate imaging of NETosis is essential for unraveling its mechanisms and therapeutic implications, although limitations of specificity and flexibility remain. In this article, we present modified nanobodies targeting Ly6C/G and histones for imaging of NETosis. Single-domain antibodies (VHHs), also known as nanobodies, targeting Ly6C/G specifically bind to neutrophils, and anti-histone nanobodies selectively target NET-associated histones, enabling NETosis monitoring. These nanobodies are engineered to optimize fluorescent probe labeling and can enable high-resolution visualization of NETosis through whole-body fluorescence tomography and/or intravital microscopy. Our approach offers an alternative for expanding the existing NETosis imaging toolkit. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Background Remover (BGR) is a novel software tool developed as a plugin to the well-known ImageJ program and designed to address the challenges of analysing fluorescent microscopy images characterised by low signal-to-noise ratios and heterogeneous backgrounds. The used algorithm effectively differentiates between signal and noise pixels, preserving the signal while eliminating noise. This functionality enables the analysis of images with objects of varying intensities, allowing for reliable identification even in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Furthermore, BGR offers the capability to determine the intensity of identified objects, enhancing its utility for researchers in the field. The paper describes the algorithm and the program functioning, as well as the carried out tests of its performance.

ABSTRACT:
Silicon carbide (SiC) detectors have been widely demonstrated to be suitable alternative detectors for dosimetry in FLASH radiotherapy, showing radiation hardness and dose-rate independence at the FLASH radiotherapy instantaneous dose rates (IDRs). However, the practical use of such devices in the preclinical/clinical environment still requires the development of special handy housing enabling the quality assurance (QA) measurements under the reference dosimetric conditions. A 10μm thick, 4.5 mm2area SiC detector produced by the STLab company was recently embedded at the INFN-Catania Division inside a plastic waterproof 15 mm diameter cylindrical housing. This encapsulated version of SiC (eSiC) allows the measurement of the dose in reference conditions and of the dose profiles in liquid/solid water phantoms for assuring high accuracy dosimetry QA procedures. Dosimetric characterizations were performed with both electron and proton beams at conventional and ultra-high dose rates (UHDR). A first experiment was carried out at the Centro Pisano for Flash Radiotherapy using UHDR 9 MeV electron beams to confirm the linearity of the charge response as a function of the dose per pulse after the encapsulation procedure. A linearity from 1.8 Gy/pulse up to about 12 Gy/pulse, corresponding to an IDR of 3 MGy s-1, was found. The percentage depth dose (PDD) distribution in water of 9 MeV electron beams was also measured and compared with the PDD measured with a Freiburg Physikalisch-Technische Werkstätten Dr. Pychlau GmbH (PTW) flash diamond detector, used as reference dosimeter. The eSiC detector was also tested with proton beams accelerated by the IBA Proteus 235 cyclotron at the Trento Proton Therapy facility. A response independence on the total delivered dose (1-30 Gy) and average dose rate (50-530 Gy s-1) was found using the UHDR 228 MeV proton beam available along the experimental beamline. The depth dose distribution measured with the eSiC within a liquid water phantom was successfully compared with the one simultaneously measured by the IBA PPC05 reference chamber, using 180 MeV clinical proton beams. The excellent results demonstrated that this first realized eSiC prototype can be used to accurately perform reference and relative dosimetry with UHDR electron and proton beams, contributing to support the clinical translation of FLASH radiotherapy.

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondrial cristae are the site of intracellular biochemical reactions that play important roles in many life activities, and the destruction of mitochondrial cristae will lead to mitochondrial dysfunction inducing related diseases. Therefore, the visualization of mitochondria cristae is of great significance for physiopathology and medicine. Herein, we reported a group of cyanine-based fluorescent probes (Cy-OH and Cy-Cl) for tagging mitochondrial cristae under STED microscopy. Cy-OH and Cy-Cl could gather in the inner mitochondrial membrane via electrostatic interaction. And the ability of Cy-OH to target mitochondria depending on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while Cy-Cl could tightly immobilize in mitochondria benefiting by the reaction between its chloromethyl group and mitochondrial proteins, regardless of MMP. Moreover, Cy-Cl reacted fully with mitochondrial proteins during the staining process and exhibited superior performance than some commercial mitochondrial trackers. Importantly, profiting from the high photostability and high brightness of the two probes, they could clearly depict the mitochondrial cristae at a concentration of 200 nM under STED microscopy. We believe that Cy-OH and Cy-Cl could serve as vigoroso tools to study mitochondrial cristae changes in various physiological and pathological processes.

ABSTRACT:
Organic near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores with donor-acceptor (D-A) architectures have emerged as a preeminent paradigm in optoelectronic engineering and biomedical applications. However, conventional D-A NIR emitters often suffer from aggregation-induced quenching or weak absorption owing to the use of planar (e.g., carbazole) or highly twisted (e.g., triphenylamine) donor units, which impairs their versatile utility in molecular and aggregated states. Herein, we proposed a unique chair-shaped indoline donor (cID) with a hybrid planar-twisted conformation, which affords bright various states (solution, solid, microspheres, nanoparticles, and films) NIR emission spanning 650-1200 nm, with tails extending to 1600 nm. The cID donor promotes electron localization, imparting higher oscillator strength and a smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gap to the designed NIR fluorophores, which together enhance light-harvesting capacity and induce red-shifted emission. Meanwhile, the sterically hindered nonconjugated group in cID effectively restricts low frequency vibration-induced non-radiative decay, as evidenced by the reduced reorganization energy and Huang-Rhys factor in both isolated and crystalline phase. Through structurally π-conjugation extension, these NIR fluorophores exhibit robust various-state NIR-I (photoluminescence quantum yields up to 67.8% and brightness up to 15668 M-1 cm-1) and NIR-II emission, which allows diverse advanced applications in porous ceramic damage detection, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, and NIR-II vascular imaging, thereby positioning cID as a versatile toolkit to create a novel NIR dye library for biomedical and optoelectronic field.

TITLE: An unexpected Australian piece of the palm bug puzzle (Heteroptera: Thaumastocoridae: Xylastodorinae): natural history, comparative morphology and systematics.

ABSTRACT:
Palm bugs are an elusive group of true bugs, replete with conundrums, such as living fossils, transoceanic disjunctions, rarity, palm associations, and autapomorphic morphology. Knowledge of the group is historically slim, up until the recent documentation of a flux of new species in both the southwest Pacific and the Neotropical region. In this work we present the first palm bug from continental Australia, restricted to the wet tropics of Queensland. This taxon, Austrodiscocoris monteithi gen. nov. et sp. nov., is described, as is its specialist association with the widespread Alexandra Palm species, Archontophoenix alexandrae. This new species shares characters with both southwest Pacific xylastodorines as well as species of the Western Hemisphere genus Discocoris. To determine its systematic position we report on fine scale morphological observations, using optical and scanning microscopy, as well as X-ray tomography (= micro-CT), with the latter employed for the first time to disclose the internal anatomy of the reproductive systems of both sexes. This information is in part incorporated in an extended phylogenetic analysis of the subfamily Xylastodorinae, for two data partitions: 1) Complete taxon partition: all Recent plus fossil taxa (n=39) and 2) Trimmed taxon partition: recent taxa with sufficient data coverage (n=29). The results verify a highly supported Thaumastocoridae and the two included subfamilies. Austrodiscocoris monteithi is imbedded in a clade that includes the Neotropical genera Discocoris and Xylastotylus. Separately, the Norfolk Island species Latebracoris norfolcensis is in a well-supported clade that includes the Neotropical genus Neolatebracoris and the Oriental genus Thaicoris. The work provides a rediagnosis of the subfamily and diagnostic key to all xylastodorine genera past and present. It concludes with a discussion on further puzzles on palm bug-palm associations, biogeographic implications, and the value of micro-CT in the search for new character systems in the suborder Heteroptera.

TITLE: Pollen-pistil interaction in Mauritia flexuosa: structural and cytological aspects provide insight into the reproductive success of a dioecious palm with supra-annual flowering in a semiarid environment.

ABSTRACT:
The success of pollen-pistil interaction in Mauritia flexuosa (buriti), a palm adapted to the humid ecosystems, 'veredas', within the Cerrado, is influenced by intrinsic and environmental factors. Its supra-annual flowering, dioecy, and adverse climate conditions pose challenges for fertilization, therefore information on floral biology is essential. This study aimed to ascertain stigma receptivity, and elucidate structural, cytochemical, and ultrastructural aspects of the pollen-pistil relationship. Flowers were analysed at intervals post-anthesis (hpa) and post-pollination (hpp). A stigma receptivity test was performed using H2O2 solution. Pistil samples were processed for anatomical, histochemical, and electron microscopy evaluation. The stigma is wet and papillate type, with subepidermis containing sclerenchyma connected to vascular bundles. Stigma receptivity lasts around 36 hpa. The pollen tube penetrates the papilla at 2 hpp and develops in the symplast, towards the stylar canal. The papillae have loose cell walls that facilitate the secretion and contain a rich population of organelles, including large peroxisomes. Fertilization occurs 24 hpp, and during this period the stigma surface is free of pathogens. The vascular connection to the pistil surface favours the germination of pollen grains. The pistil has a strong protective system until fertilization occurs. The symplastic growth of the pollen tube in the stigma and the efficient secretory apparatus of the pistil contribute to rapid fertilization. These structural characteristics and secretion dynamics enhance reproduction of buriti, even with supra-annual flowering and in semiarid conditions.

ABSTRACT:
This paper investigates a structured illumination microscopy method based on multi-channel information fusion (multi-channel information fusion structured illumination microscopy [MF-SIM]) to enhance the accuracy and stability of micro-nano 3D morphological measurements. The method utilizes multi-channel images captured by a color CCD and leverages the characteristics of different wavelengths corresponding to distinct focal planes to extract abundant modulation information from a single frame. By fusing multi-channel data, it effectively overcomes the vulnerability to noise interference caused by small gradients at the modulation peak in traditional single-channel systems. Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional structured illumination microscopy methods based on monochrome CCDs, the MF-SIM method exhibits significant advantages in measurement accuracy and repeatability.

PMID: 40755389
DOI: 10.1039/d5nh00395d

ABSTRACT:
This study introduces the concept of photophysical structured illumination velocimetry (PP-SIV), verified through comprehensive numerical simulations. PP-SIV can capture two-dimensional (2D) flow velocity fields from a single snapshot image of the emission pattern from luminescent probes, leveraging the suitable photodynamics of the probes and using the applied excitation field pattern as reference. By eliminating the need for any beam or sample scan, PP-SIV has the potential to significantly accelerate the data acquisition process required for velocity field imaging. Furthermore, with excitation patterns applied at different depths, three-dimensional (3D) flow imaging can be potentially achieved. We propose lanthanide-based upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), particularly those capable of both absorbing and emitting within the highly biocompatible and transparent NIR-II window (1000-1700 nm), as promising probe candidates for implementing PP-SIV. This concept holds significant potential to pave the way for rapid, three-dimensional (3D) blood flow imaging at sufficient speeds for real-time monitoring of hemodynamic events in the brain.

PMID: 40797918
DOI: 10.1364/OE.551326

ABSTRACT:
In continuous vertical scanning structured illumination microscopy (CVS-SIM) for three-dimensional (3D) measurement, each scanning position requires only a single exposure, after which the surface topography is reconstructed using the vertical scanning position corresponding to the maximum modulation. However, limited acquisition signals and imaging noise introduced during the continuous scanning process result in significant noise interference in the calculated modulation response (MR), and existing peak localization methods cannot effectively work in signals overwhelmed by noise, leading to reduced accuracy or even complete failure of peak localization. In this paper, we propose a robust peak localization method of modulation response using probability density distribution. The probability density equation for the peak position is formulated using the gradient information from the collected image points across multiple dimensions. Based on the high-weight probability density distribution region, the effective range within the MR is adaptively selected according to varying noise levels for peak localization. This approach mitigates the disturbance from irrelevant noise in MR by analyzing the contribution of gradient changes in the captured information to the position of maximum modulation. Furthermore, the appropriate peak localization range is adaptively selected based on the noise condition, thereby minimizing redundant calculations and enhancing the reconstruction speed. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experimental validation, demonstrating its potential for high-precision and complex surface measurements.

ABSTRACT:
Event cameras only report changes in brightness when thresholds in individual pixels relative to previous levels are crossed. They output sparse streams of events that quantify these changes spatially and temporally. We have developed a measurement system using two event cameras in a stereo configuration with a specialized projector for 3D measurements of static objects. We show that optimal contrast in the structured illumination yields high-fidelity measurements, reaching 3D root-mean-square deviations of 0.6 mm (≈0.3% of the measurement volume's diagonal). This work opens up the possibility of precise event-based, highly dynamic 4D measurements in the near future.

ABSTRACT:
This study characterizes the function of a grass-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, HvST1, in regulating synapsis and crossover (CO) formation during meiosis in barley (Hordeum vulgare). In large-genome cereals, COs are predominantly restricted to distal chromosomal regions, limiting genetic recombination and breeding flexibility. We aimed to identify genetic components regulating CO frequency and distribution. A frameshift mutation in HvST1 was identified in the semi-sterile barley near-isogenic line BW233 through fine mapping of the des12.w locus. The causal role of this mutation was validated via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. HvST1 function was investigated using in vitro autoubiquitination and substrate ubiquitination assays, while meiotic progression was assessed using structured illumination microscopy and immunolocalization of key axis and synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins. Loss of HvST1 function led to disrupted SC formation, persistent ASY1 signal, and aberrant ZYP1 polycomplex formation. Despite impaired synapsis, Hvst1 mutants showed a significant increase in distal CO frequency. HvST1 was shown to ubiquitinate ASY1 in vitro, linking its activity to protein turnover at the chromosome axis. HvST1 is critical for normal synapsis and CO regulation during meiosis in barley. Its loss disrupts SC progression but enhances distal CO formation, revealing a previously uncharacterized ubiquitination-based mechanism modulating recombination in grasses.

ABSTRACT:
In a living organism, the interplay of stochastically interacting molecules brings forth structures and processes robustly organized in space and time. Single-molecule localization microscopy and tracking emerged as important techniques to visualize the super-resolved spatial distribution and real-time motion of individual fluorescently labeled molecules in a living cell or multicellular organism. Thereby, single-molecule tracking (SMT) enables quantifying kinetic mechanisms underlying vital organismal processes. This review covers the methodology of SMT in living cells and multicellular organisms, including labeling approaches and microscopy techniques, with a focus on recent developments in temporal excitation patterns facilitating extracting kinetic properties and the analysis of molecular kinetic parameters accessible by SMT. Emphasis lies on the application of this methodology to quantifying the kinetics of proteins such as transcription factors, and some recent examples are highlighted. The review concludes by envisioning future perspectives of SMT in living systems.

ABSTRACT:
Label-free single-molecule detection is essential for studying biomolecules in their native state, yet having materials with intrinsic molecular specificity to identify a broad range of molecules without complex functionalization remains challenging. We present a method that utilizes emissions from selectively activated defects at the aqueous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) interface to detect biomolecules including lipids, nucleotides, and amino acids. Using spectrally resolved single-molecule localization microscopy, we harvest spatial, spectral, and temporal data of individual events to uncover optical fingerprints of biomolecules. The defect emissions show chemical sensitivity to biomolecules that interact transiently with hBN surface defects. We demonstrate differences in defect emissions activated by various lipids and amino acids. This approach allows us to probe fine chemical differences, as small as the single deprotonation of an amino acid's side chain, and detect dynamics of biomolecules at the interface with exceptional detail. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the classification of five different amino acids at the single-molecule level by exploiting a Random Forest model for analyzing single-defect spectra. Our findings shed light on hBN-biomolecule interactions and highlight the potential of hBN for label-free single-molecule detection with chemical sensitivity.

ABSTRACT:
Tau aggregation plays a critical role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a pathological hallmark. While much attention is given to NFTs, emerging evidence highlights nano-sized tau oligomers as toxic entities. Using super-resolution microscopy, we visualized nano-sized tau aggregates (nano-aggregates) in human postmortem brain tissues from intermediate and advanced AD, Primary Age-Related Tauopathy (PART), and controls lacking tau pathology. Surprisingly, tau nano-aggregates hyperphosphorylated at threonine 231 (p-T231) and threonine 181 (p-T181)are detected in control cases, whereas hyperphosphorylated serine 202/threonine 205 (p-S202/T205)nano-aggregates are specifically associated with AD and, to a lesser extent, observed in PART. This finding suggests that distinct hyperphosphorylation signatures distinguish physiological from pathological nano-aggregates. Moreover, nano-aggregates exhibit morphological differences between AD and non-AD conditions, increasing in size and complexity in AD. In advanced AD, nano-aggregates typically contain multiple distinct hyperphosphorylated residues, whereas intermediate AD nano-aggregates are predominantly marked by a single hyperphosphorylated residue. These findings reveal novel transitions in the morphology and hyperphosphorylation states of tau nano-aggregates as they shift from physiological to pathological forms. The ability to detect and profile physiological and pathological nanoscale tau aggregates in human brain tissues opens new avenues for studying the molecular underpinnings of tauopathies.

ABSTRACT:
Expansion microscopy is an imaging method that overcomes the resolution barriers of traditional diffraction-limited light microscopes via isotropic physical expansion of biological cells, tissues, and organisms. This technique enhances the ability to visualize proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules at nanoscale resolutions. While this approach has predominantly been applied to biomedical applications, workflows for plant systems have emerged. Here we review the development of expansion microscopy methods for the plant kingdom. Collectively, these advances range from isolated organelles, single cells and unicellular organisms, to whole organs, embryos, and reproductive tissues. We highlight the unique advantages and findings from individual techniques and provide a perspective of potential directions that expansion microscopy can be applied to answer important plant research questions.

ABSTRACT:
Protein-polymer conjugates (PPCs) combine the unique bioactivities of the proteins with the tunable properties of the polymers, but their synthesis typically requires premodification of components. Herein, we report the occurrence of radical polymerization termination by phenol derivatives as a prevalent side reaction, allowing direct covalent conjugation of polymer chains to solvent-accessible tyrosine residues in native proteins. This reaction, we termed grafting via tyrosine-terminated radical polymerization (TyrTer-grafting). TyrTer-grafting exhibits applicability to diverse monomers and proteins, achieves improved conjugation efficiency under proximity-driven enzymatic catalysis, and preserves protein function more effectively than the traditional activated ester-mediated method. In addition, TyrTer-grafting enables both direct cell-surface polymerization to control cellular aggregation and anchor-free expansion microscopy (ExM) to generate high-quality images with super-resolved details. This work provides a new perspective for fabricating functional macromolecules and presents a significant discovery for radical chemistry and bioconjugation chemistry.

ABSTRACT:
Diatoms are ubiquitous aquatic microalgae critical to our planet and were among the pioneer model organisms in cell biology because of their large and transparent cell structure. However, their robust silica cell wall, which renders diatoms impermeable to many dyes and antibodies, as well as challenging for gene editing tools, likely hindered the broader establishment of diatoms as standard model species, despite their unique cellular physiology and remarkable ecological success. Here, we demonstrate that cryo-fixation combined with ultrastructural expansion microscopy (cryo-ExM) can overcome the silica barrier across diverse diatom species spanning over 80 million years of evolutionary time. We illustrate cryo-ExM's potential to provide scalable, cost-effective volumetric imaging of diatom ultrastructure in laboratory cultures, as well as field-collected samples from the pan-European TREC expedition. We first reveal striking similarities in interphase microtubule organization across diverse diatom species by characterizing cytoskeletal arrangements throughout cell cycles and populations, uniting both pennate and centric morphologies under shared principles. We further unveil diatom photosynthetic diversity through qualitative and quantitative comparative analyses of chloroplast and pyrenoid morphologies, demonstrating that each diatom species architects unique photosynthetic machinery. Using cryo-ExM on environmental samples further exposes intricate diatom symbioses, revealing tight spatial organization of ecological interactions. This methodology makes diatoms more accessible for modern and comparative cell biology research, providing new opportunities to investigate the cellular physiology of one of Earth's most successful photosynthetic groups.

TITLE: Transfection of the free-living alga Chromera velia enables direct comparisons with its parasitic apicomplexan relative, Toxoplasma gondii.
AUTHORS: Tengganu Isadonna F, Hu Ke
JOURNAL: Journal of cell science (2025)
PMID: 41208444
DOI: 10.1242/jcs.264400

ABSTRACT:
Chromera velia is a photosynthetic, free-living alga closely related to the apicomplexan parasites, a phylum of intracellular pathogens responsible for many devastating diseases, including malaria, cryptosporidiosis, and toxoplasmosis. With molecular and cellular landmarks clearly related to but distinguishable from those found in apicomplexan parasites, Chromera provides an opportunity to investigate the evolutionary origin of the structures and processes needed for intracellular parasitism. However, tools for defining localization and functions of gene products do not exist for Chromera, which creates a major bottleneck for exploring its biology. Here we report two major advances in exploring the cell biology of this free-living relative of a large group of intracellular parasites: 1) successful cell transformation, and 2) the implementation of expansion microscopy. The initial analysis enabled by these tools generated new insights into subcellular organization in different life stages of Chromera. These new developments boost the potential of Chromera as a model system for understanding the evolution of parasitism in apicomplexans.

DOI: 10.1103/ywr6-mzz5

ABSTRACT:
Living systems relay information across membrane interfaces to coordinate compartment functions. We identify a physical mechanism for selective information transmission that arises from the sigmoidal response of surface-bound particle densities to spatial features in adjacent external structures through a nonuniform binding energy. This mechanism implements a form of spatial thresholding, enabling the binary classification of external cues. Expansion microscopy measurements of nuclear pore complex distributions in S. arctica show signatures of such physical thresholding.

DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-66393-5

ABSTRACT:
Blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites rely on a non-photosynthetic plastid, the apicoplast, for survival, making it an attractive target for antimalarial intervention. Like the mitochondrion, the apicoplast cannot be generated de novo and must be inherited by daughter parasites during cell division. This inheritance relies on coordinated apicoplast positioning and fission, but the molecular mechanisms controlling these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized P. falciparum protein (Pf3D7_0613600), which we name PfAnchor, as a key regulator of apicoplast fission. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), we show that PfAnchor localizes to the apicoplast throughout the asexual blood-stage. Conditional depletion disrupts apicoplast fission, leading to incomplete cytokinesis and parasite death. Notably, loss of the apicoplast's elongated branched structure via azithromycin treatment rescues these defects, underscoring Anchor's specific role in apicoplast fission. Immunoprecipitation identified an interaction with the dynamin-like GTPase PfDyn2, a key mediator of both apicoplast and mitochondrial fission, establishing PfAnchor as the first apicoplast-specific dynamin adaptor protein. Our findings define PfAnchor as an essential factor for apicoplast fission and inheritance in P. falciparum blood-stage parasites, highlighting parasite-specific organelle division as a potential vulnerability for therapeutic intervention.

ABSTRACT:
Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has revolutionized fluorescence imaging enabling insights into the molecular organization of cells that were previously unconceivable. Latest developments now allow the visualization of individual molecules with nanometer precision and imaging with molecular resolution. However, translating these achievements to imaging under physiological conditions in cells remains challenging. The higher the spatial resolution is pushed by the development of improved SRM methods the more challenging the problems we are confronted when aiming to use them for sub-10 nm fluorescence imaging in cells. It turns out that most developed SRM methods that demonstrate nanometer resolution cannot be directly implemented for molecular resolution imaging in cells. Particularly, fluorescence labeling, i.e. high-density covalent labeling of the molecules of interest with fluorophores with minimal linkage error represents currently a nearly insurmountable obstacle. In addition, even if high labeling densities can be realized it has to be considered that fluorophores can interact via different energy pathways and thus impede super-resolution imaging in the sub-10 nm range. Here, we describe the boundaries, discuss the challenges we must accept and show strategies to circumvent them and achieve true molecular resolution fluorescence imaging under physiological conditions in cells.

ABSTRACT:
Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has gained recognition as an advanced imaging technique capable of visualizing microvasculature with exceptional detail, offering critical insights into cerebral blood flow dynamics. The ULM pipeline involves multiple computationally intensive stages, which significantly slow down the process. The localization of microbubbles (MBs) is a critical step that enhances the accuracy of MB tracking. In this study, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and present KAN-ULM, a highly compact deep network that optimizes the localization step in ULM. Our research systematically analyzes various configurations of KAN against a well-defined metric, providing valuable insights for optimizing network architecture. Despite operating within a limited parameter range, our results demonstrate that KAN achieves remarkable resolution, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential in high-resolution imaging applications.Clinical relevance- The KAN-ULM model significantly enhances MB localization in ULM, which could potentially enable finer visualization of the microvasculature and support more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments in future clinical applications.

ABSTRACT:
Morphological observation and classification of bone marrow cells in smear specimens is an important examination in toxicity studies for pharmaceuticals. However, acquiring the expertise for classifying bone marrow cells using light microscopy requires years of training, resulting in significant labor and time. To efficiently acquire accurate and objective data without oversight, a system for the automated detection and morphological classification of rat bone marrow cells was developed through machine learning using whole slide images (WSIs) obtained from smear specimens. Our system integrates SSD300 for object detection, VDSR for image super-resolution, and EfficientNetV2B0 for classification. WSIs of rat bone marrow smear specimens were obtained at 40× magnification using a WSI scanner. The fine-tuning of the bone marrow cell detection model using SSD300 was performed with 720 images obtained from WSIs of rat bone marrow smear specimens. The morphological classification model for 13 types of bone marrow cells using VDSR-EfficientNetV2B0 was optimized with a total of 144,000 cell images. The system for detection of bone mallow cells achieved an average precision of 79%. Additionally, the morphological classification achieved an accuracy of 98% when compared to expert classification. Our algorithm enabled the automated classification of cells on rat bone marrow smear specimens with extremely high accuracy and in a short time, approximately 80 sec, to classify 5,000 cells per image, without oversight. This capability suggests that the algorithm could potentially be utilized as a supportive tool for the toxicity evaluation of bone marrow smear specimens.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy in biomolecular environments are usually performed in aqueous solution and preferably using red-emitting dyes. However, water quenches their fluorescence. We explore in this contribution how host-guest interactions between red-emitting fluorophores and macrocycles such as cyclodextrins and cucurbiturils can prevent quenching by shielding the dyes from water, thereby enhancing their brightness. We successfully apply this strategy in super-resolution imaging.

ABSTRACT:
In imaging the neonatal brain, overcoming the diffraction limit of conventional ultrasound is required to achieve images of sufficient spatial resolution. Super-resolution imaging uses ultrasound localization microscopy to image inert microbubble contrast at high frame rates, allowing exquisite detail and flow information on intracranial vessels. While currently more common in research settings, super-resolution imaging is beginning to see selective clinical use. In contrast, advanced Doppler techniques, which do not require contrast, offer flow imaging far better than that of conventional Doppler and are readily available in the clinical setting. We discuss the pros and cons of both modalities and the promising applications of both in the clinical setting with a series of case examples.

ABSTRACT:
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a vital tool in botanical research. Image fusion is introduced for resolution enhancement of MSI data from animal samples, but its application to plant MSI data resulted in unsatisfactory visualizations due to the distinct morphological characteristics of plant tissues. Herein, this study presents loss controlled residual network (LCRN), a workflow dedicated to the super-resolution fusion of plant MSI data. The pipeline used a residual connection-based neural network implemented with a novel loss metric called edge perceptual loss. Edge perceptual loss is developed for evaluating complex morphological information that can not be properly reflected by common image metrics, and its implementation in loss propagation is vital to the quality of the fusion result. Compared to existing deep learning-based methods, LCRN is able to generate a high-quality super-resolution fusion image of extra high magnification (up to 20-fold) that combined chemical and morphological information obtained from MSI and microscopy, respectively.

ABSTRACT:
This paper re-examines a 20-year-old experiment showing super-resolved intensity variations in the far field using visible light, achieved by nanoscale modifications of the diffraction slit spacing. This study was motivated by earlier unexplained far-field microscopy images that achieved λ/10 resolution without near-field operation. Our hypothesis, backed by 2D finite element analysis, proposes that the local illumination of the scanning tip disturbs the intensity transmitted through the diffraction mask, creating super-resolved images through a far-field collection of diffracted energy variations. A review of the historical scientific contributions supports this interpretation. We explore the relationship between information theory, space-bandwidth product concepts, and these observations. These findings demonstrate the possibility of achieving far-field optical super-resolution without requiring near-field proximity of the scanning element, potentially enabling new applications across various wavelengths and imaging scenarios.

ABSTRACT:
High-spatial-resolution mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) visualizes molecular distributions in tissues and cells. However, achieving higher spatial resolution typically necessitates smaller pixel dimensions and an increased number of pixels, leading to longer data acquisition times and diminished analytical throughput. Although deep learning approaches have demonstrated significant potential in MSI, they typically require large training data sets or paired images, which are often unavailable. Herein, we propose the reference-based super-resolution for mass spectrometry imaging (RSR-MSI) method, with optical microscopy images as reference frames to extract abundant texture information. By integrating this with ion intensity data from the original MS images, we develop an image-specific super-resolution network. Employing solely a single low-resolution MS image coupled with a reference optical image, we successfully reconstruct high-resolution MS images for biological tissues and single cells, producing results with rich chemical and textural details. This approach significantly decreases the routine pixel-by-pixel scanning time by an order of magnitude while achieving high spatial resolution using existing mass spectrometry instruments without any customized modifications. Overall, our work introduces and validates the application of image super-resolution methods within the realm of single-cell MSI at subcellular resolution, paving the way for the development of high-spatial-resolution and high-throughput MSI for cellular biology research.

PMID: 40424735
DOI: 10.1016/j.ultras.2025.107704

ABSTRACT:
Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can surpass the diffraction-limited resolution of conventional ultrasound by localizing individual microbubbles with sub-pixel precision. However, if the point-spread function (PSF) of the imaging system is insufficiently sampled, aliasing artifacts arise and degrade both microbubble localization and motion correction accuracy. In this study, we derive and validate a set of transmit-receive conditions that ensure artifact-free PSFs without unnecessary computational overhead. We demonstrate that by appropriately selecting the plane-wave steering angles, transmit pulse cycle count, and receive aperture (F-number) in relation to the pixel spacing, high spatial frequencies in the PSF remain within the Nyquist limit for all imaging depths. Through a series of simulations, wire phantom tests, and custom flow phantom experiments, we compare undersampled, oversampled, and balanced parameters. The balanced configurations, where the maximum frequency of the PSF matches the beamforming grid, consistently mitigate aliasing artifacts, eliminate grid-like patterns, and preserve microbubble trajectories under sub-pixel translations. In a flow phantom study, we further confirm that ULM images obtained with these optimized settings retain fine details without incurring the substantial computational costs of an overly fine sampling grid. Our findings highlight the importance of analysing PSF bandwidth in both lateral and axial dimensions and offer a straightforward method to align transmit pulse width, receive aperture, and grid spacing. Ultimately, this approach provides a pathway toward efficient, high-fidelity ULM, with significant implications for real-time super-resolution imaging in clinical and preclinical environments.

ABSTRACT:
The ability to focus light beyond the diffraction limit has been a long-standing challenge in optical science. Although many innovative techniques have been developed, ranging from near-field scanning optical microscopy to super-resolution and plasmonic approaches, these methods often rely on complex configurations and expensive setups. In this study, we propose a way for optical hyper-focusing by simply placing a gold nanoparticle on a silicon/gold multilayer metamaterial. In our configuration, the gold nanoparticle generates a localized plasmon resonance hotspot, exciting high-wave vector electric fields that propagate through the Si/Au multilayer. These fields progressively focus at the bottom interface, forming focal spots tens of nanometers in diameter across a high-loss propagation zone (∼100 nm). An optimal spot size of 44 nm and an intensity 4.5 times that of the incident light are observed at a wavelength of 780 nm using a 160 nm gold nanoparticle, surpassing both diffraction limits and the nanoparticle geometric size. This work provides insights into how multilayer metamaterials can be utilized to achieve sub-wavelength light confinement and optical hyper-focusing, opening possibilities for advanced optical applications in super-resolution imaging, nano-optics, and integrated photonic devices.

ABSTRACT:
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal and aggressive breast cancer among all the breast cancer subtypes. Despite several attempts, to date, there is an extensive lack of therapeutic intervention. Hence, there is a dire need for an effective biomarker to timely diagnose TNBC. Here, utilizing super-resolution microscopy, the remodeling structural aspects of euchromatin and heterochromatin in TNBC are studied and the results are compared with non-cancerous and non-TNBC cell lines. The nanoscopic visualization reveals a distinct difference in chromatin remodeling in TNBC in comparison to the other two cell lines. While the euchromatin density is found to increase, the heterochromatin is found to decrease. A complete switching of the heterochromatin-euchromatin ratio is observed in TNBC cells thus proposing that chromatin remodeling and chromatin morphological changes can be pursued as one of the targets for diagnostic purposes. Increased expression of structure specific recognition protein-1(SSRP-1) protein supports the increased rate of chromatin remodeling in breast cancer cell lines. The results may lead to developing a new strategy for diagnosing TNBC patients.

ABSTRACT:
Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) enables super-resolution imaging of microvascular structures by localizing microbubbles from clutter-filtered ultrafast ultrasound data. However, conventional clutter filtering methods, particularly those based on singular value decomposition, are computationally intensive and thus impractical for real-time applications. In this study, we introduce AF-UNet, a lightweight multi-angle deep learning framework designed to accelerate clutter filtering in ULM. The model processes spatiotemporal slices from rotated 3D in-phase/quadrature data and fuses them to suppress tissue signals and reconstruct microvascular volumes. AF-UNet demonstrates robust performance across diverse anatomical organs, including brain, eye, and kidney, achieving strong generalization with consistently high image fidelity. Systematic analysis reveals optimal angular acquisition settings that enhance fusion performance, with peak improvements observed at 2$^\circ$-3$^\circ$ separations for ocular datasets and slightly larger angles for rat kidney and brain datasets. AF-UNet achieves over 20-fold computational speedup compared to conventional SVD filtering while preserving microvascular details, offering a practical pathway toward real-time, clinically applicable ULM.

ABSTRACT:
Imaging can help us understand the role neuroglia plays in health and during the course of neurologic disorders. In vivo microscopy has had a great impact on our understanding of how neuroglia behaves during health and disease. While initially the technique was hindered by the limited penetration depth in brain tissue, recent advancements lead to increasing possibilities for imaging of deeper brain structures, even at super-resolution. Unfortunately, in vivo microscopy cannot be applied in a clinical setting and thus cannot be used to study neuroglia in patient populations. However, noninvasive imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can. PET has provided valuable information on the involvement of neuroglia in neurologic disorders. To more specifically image microglia and astrocytes, many new PET biomarkers have been defined for which PET tracers are continuously developed, evaluated, and improved. A cell-type specific PET tracer with favorable imaging characteristics can have a huge impact on neuroglia research. While being less sensitive than PET, MRI is a more accessible imaging technique. Initially, only general neuroinflammation processes could be imaged with MRI, but newly developed methods and sequences allow for increasing cell-type specificity. Overall, while each imaging method comes with limitations, improvements are continuously made, all with the aim to truly understand the role that neuroglia play in health and disease.

ABSTRACT:
The morphology of the mitochondrial network is a major indicator of cellular health and function, with changes often linked to various physiological and pathological conditions. As a result, efficient methods to quickly assess mitochondrial shape in cellular populations from microscopy images in a quantitative manner are of high interest for the health and life sciences. Here, we present MitoClass, a deep learning-based software designed for automated mitochondrial classification. MitoClass employs a classification algorithm that categorizes mitochondrial network shapes into three classes: fragmented, intermediate, and elongated. By leveraging super-resolution images, we curated a comprehensive dataset for training, including both high- and low-resolution representations of mitochondrial networks. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, our model effectively distinguishes between different mitochondrial morphologies. Through rigorous training and validation, MitoClass provides a fast, accurate, and user-friendly solution for researchers and clinicians to assess the organization of the mitochondrial network as a proxy for studying organelle health and dynamics.

ABSTRACT:
Materials are challenging to synthetically program down to the atom level. Nature, however, excels at creating hierarchical materials from nanoscale building blocks, a feat that remains a major challenge in synthetic systems. A deeper understanding of the molecular rules governing self-assembly would unlock the potential for designing genetically programmable materials with atomic precision. Hexameric bacterial microcompartment (BMC-H) proteins offer a powerful model system for exploring this question. These sequence-defined proteins naturally assemble into complex architectures and can be expressed biologically, making them ideal candidates for studying how minor sequence variations influence supramolecular structure. In this work, we leverage cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) alongside immunostaining and super-resolution microscopy to investigate the self-assembly behavior of two BMC-H proteins, PduA and PduJ. We find that both proteins form micron- to millimeter-scale structures when expressed in vitro. Further, we demonstrate how single-point mutation changes lead PduA and PduJ to form significantly different supramolecular structures when produced using CFPS. These studies support the future exploration of self-assembling proteins as programmable scaffolds in broad materials applications.

ABSTRACT:
Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) enables super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) imaging of microvasculature, while ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) characterizes molecular signatures using microbubbles (MBs) targeted to specific biomarkers. Although the co-localization of SRUS and USMI has been demonstrated previously, USMI resolution is limited by ultrasound diffraction-based effects and does not match the super-resolved microvasculature. This study introduces the Incremental Burst Sequence (IBS) method to induce the population of polydisperse targeted MBs to burst progressively, achieving MBs spatial separation and enabling high-resolution USMI (HR-USMI) localization. IBS method employs interleaved imaging and bursting pulses, with transmit voltages of bursting pulses incrementally increased to produce a gradual rise in the acoustic pressure. IBS is first validated optically in vitro using a cellulose tubing phantom, and MB remaining count during IBS is measured. Thereafter, in vivo validation is performed in a murine tumor model, and the intra-tumoral targeted MB signal intensity is measured during IBS. Furthermore, high frame-rate data for SRUS and IBS data for HR-USMI are acquired from a single bolus injection of MBs to generate composite images with high-resolution molecular signatures superimposed on the tumor microvasculature. Both in vitro and in vivo results validate the technical feasibility of the proposed IBS method. In addition, we demonstrate that higher bursting pulse repetitions lead to a faster disruption of the MB population during IBS. Finally, HR-USMI signals localized within a 50 μm × 50 μm grid are aligned with microvessels resolved better than 100 μm, presenting a combination of molecular signatures and anatomical structures at fine resolution.

TITLE: Recombination-coupled DNA synthesis facilitates post-invasion steps in meiotic crossover and noncrossover formations.

ABSTRACT:
During meiotic double-strand break (DSB) repair, most DSBs undergo tightly regulated 5' end resection, generating 3' single-stranded (ss) DNA tails, which assemble Rad51 and Dmc1 filaments to facilitate homology search and strand exchange for recombination. However, the occurrence of local DNA synthesis at the 3' end of the ssDNA in DSBs concerning the majority crossover and noncrossover processes at the DNA level and the involvement of DNA polymerase at the recombination site have remained unclear. Here, we investigated meiotic recombination-coupled DNA synthesis (MRDS) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through a physical analysis of recombination events, timed incorporation of thymidine analogs, and super-resolution microscopy imaging. We demonstrate that DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) is required to extend the initial D-loop through its end-primed synthesis activity. Importantly, Pol δ-mediated MRDS facilitates post-invasion steps for both double Holliday junction and noncrossover formations. We infer that MRDS is required for displacement-loop/single-end invasion extension through end-primed synthesis, ensuring accurate base pairing between the leading and complementary strands. This study highlights the critical role of Pol δ in MRDS and illustrates the robust regulation of recombination during the post-invasion stages.

ABSTRACT:
Chromatin structure is a key determinant of gene expression in eukaryotes, but it has not been possible to define the structure of cis-regulatory elements at the scale of the proteins that bind them. Here, we generate multidimensional chromosome conformation capture (3C) maps at base-pair resolution using Micro Capture-C ultra (MCCu). This can resolve contacts between individual transcription factor motifs within cis-regulatory elements. Using degron systems, we show that removal of Mediator complex components alters fine-scale promoter structure and that nucleosome depletion plays a key role in transcription factor-driven enhancer-promoter contacts. We observe that chromatin is partitioned into nanoscale domains by nucleosome-depleted regions. This structural conformation is reproduced by chemically specific coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the physicochemical properties of chromatin. Combining MCCu with molecular dynamics simulations and super-resolution microscopy allows us to propose a unified model in which the biophysical properties of chromatin orchestrate contacts between cis-regulatory elements.

ABSTRACT:
Sex chromosomes undergo various modifications that affect their synapsis during meiosis. While most of the genome achieves full synapsis by the end of pachytene, the non-recombining regions of XY (or ZW) chromosomes often remain asynaptic and fail to form physical associations at metaphase I. Despite significant progress in animal models, the meiotic behaviour dynamics of plant sex chromosomes remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed super-resolution microscopy to analyse 3D chromosome organization and the localization of key meiotic proteins. Namely, we studied the dynamics of Asynaptic1 (ASY1), Zip1 homolog (ZYP1), and HEI10 across the leptotene to pachytene stages, and compared sex chromosome behaviour in dioecious white campion (Silene latifolia) with related gynodioecious species bladder campion (S. vulgaris). Our findings show that both species exhibit a class I crossover (CO) frequency comparable to mammals, indicating moderate COs per bivalent and their similar genetic determinants. We document variation in sex chromosome configurations, from rod bivalents in diploids to open-ring tetravalents in autopolyploids, and characterize Y chromosome behaviour across XXY, XXXY, and XXYY karyotypes. These results reveal pronounced variation in pairing and synaptic patterns, even within a shared genetic background. We discuss how these patterns reflect the evolutionary trajectory of the non-recombining region and provide the most detailed cytogenetic analysis of sex chromosome pairing in a plant with evolutionarily young sex chromosomes.

TITLE: Cell cycle timing and centromere positioning in Bos taurus zygotes derived from in vitro fertilization.

ABSTRACT:
Centromeres are chromosomal loci essential for the correct segregation of genetic material during cell division. Defects in centromere function can lead to aneuploidy and cancer. During early embryonic development in mammals, prior to the first cell division, male and female genomes are separated in pronuclei located at the centre of the zygote. Parental chromatin clusters at the interface between the two pronuclei and this clustering step is critical to avoid aneuploidy in human and bovine zygotes. Yet, despite their essential function in chromosome segregation, the position and spatial organization of centromeres during the first cell cycle in mammals is mostly unknown. Previous studies conducted in bovine embryos derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF) showed that cell cycle progression impacts on the success rate of blastocyst formation. Specifically, embryos that entered earliest into S-phase or the earliest cleaving embryos were more likely to develop into blastocysts. To determine the precise timing of these events we performed a detailed characterization of key phases of the first cell cycle in bovine zygotes derived from IVF. In parallel we examined the spatial positioning of centromeres. We identify 20 h post insemination (hpi) as the timepoint when male and female pronuclei are juxtaposed and are completing S-phase. At this timepoint, we show that centromeres are positioned distal to the pronuclear interface and use super resolution microscopy to demonstrate extensive centromere clustering into chromocentres. Our results identify distinct nuclear features observed at 20 hpi, which may serve as cell cycle markers in determining successful bovine IVF.

ABSTRACT:
Protein-based particle-stabilized high internal phase Pickering emulsion gels (HIPPEGs) are gaining interest for their potential in stable, functional, and reduced-fat food products. Whey protein isolate microgels (WPIMs), as natural emulsifiers, are particularly promising; however, the combined effects of transglutaminase (T), ultrasonic (U), and pH-shifting (P) treatments on their functionality remains underexplored. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of U, P, and T treatments on the structure and characteristics of HIPPEGs. UPT treatment increased the α-helix and β-sheet content of WPIM from 23.1 % to 30.8 % and 34.5 % to 41.7 %, respectively. Its interfacial tension decreased from 37.2 mN/m to 19.4 mN/m, and its particle size reduced from 204.5 nm to 135.7 nm. The zeta potential of -44.67 mV indicated enhanced particle stability. Rheological analysis revealed UPT-treated had the highest storage modulus (4.52 Pa), stronger gel networks, and greater gel hardness (5.3 N). Enhanced thermal and centrifugal stability further confirmed their superior structural integrity. Super-resolution microscopy showed uniform, smaller droplets in UPT-treated, with steric hindrance preventing aggregation. Overall, UPT-modified WPIMs are promising for designing stable HIPPEGs applicable to high-fat foods, functional emulsions and reduced-fat products. Further studies may explore their in vitro digestion, release behavior, and long-term storage stability.

ABSTRACT:
Crassostrea gigas big defensins (Cg-BigDefs) are a family of two-domain antimicrobial peptides with broad antibacterial activity. The C-terminal domain of Cg-BigDefs harbors a β-defensin-like structure, whereas the ancestral N-terminal domain adopts a globular structure. Here, we developed molecular tools to track the fine interactions of these two domains with Staphylococcus aureus and to gain insight into Cg-BigDef1 mechanisms of action. By using super-resolution microscopy and S. aureus mutants with specific deletions of cell wall components, we found that teichoic acids (TAs) play a key role in the Cg-BigDef1 interaction with S. aureus. A ΔtagO S. aureus mutant lacking cell wall teichoic acids (WTAs) exhibited increased resistance to Cg-BigDef1. Consistently, the binding of Cg-BigDef1 to S. aureus cell wall was significantly reduced in the ΔtagO mutant. In contrast, a ΔdltA S. aureus mutant unable to transfer d-alanine onto lipoteichoic acid (LTA) showed increased susceptibility to Cg-BigDef1 and lysed rapidly in contact with the peptide. Cg-BigDef1 bound to S. aureus cell wall. In addition, competitive binding with exogenously added LTA was sufficient to impair Cg-BigDef1 antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. These data suggest that TAs are conserved molecular motifs recognized by Cg-BigDef1. Finally, we found that Cg-BigDef1 interaction with S. aureus was mediated by its N-terminal domain, which enables the C-terminal β-defensin-like domain to interact with the bacterial cell wall. Altogether, our results identify TAs as important targets for Cg-BigDef1. This interaction appears to be mediated by the ancestral N-terminal domain characteristic of this peptide family.

ABSTRACT:
The retina comprises numerous cells forming diverse neuronal circuits, which constitute the first stage of the visual pathway. Each circuit is characterized by unique features and distinct neurotransmitters, determining its role and functional significance. Given the intricate cell types within its structure, the complexity of neuronal circuits in the retina poses challenges for exploration. To better investigate retinal circuits and cross-talk, such as the link between cone and rod pathways, and precise molecular localization (neurotransmitters or neuropeptides), such as the presence of substance P-like immunoreactivity in the mouse retina, we employed a pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) method to explore synaptic connections and organization. This approach enables us to pinpoint specific intercellular synaptic connections and precise molecular localization and could play a guiding role in exploring its function. This article describes the protocol, reagents used, and detailed steps, including (1) retina fixation preparation, (2) pre-embedding immunostaining, and (3) post-fixation and embedding.

ABSTRACT:
Light sheet microscopy has become the methodology of choice for live imaging of zebrafish embryos over long time scales with minimal phototoxicity. In particular, a multiview system, which allows sample rotation, enables imaging of entire embryos from different angles. However, in most imaging sessions with a multiview system, sample mounting is a troublesome process as samples are usually prepared in a polymer tube. To aid in this process, this protocol describes basic mounting strategies for imaging early zebrafish development between the 70% epiboly and early somite stages. Specifically, the study provides statistics on the various positions the embryos default to at the 70% epiboly and bud stages within the chorion. Furthermore, it discusses the optimum number of angles and the interval between angles required for imaging whole zebrafish embryos at the early stages of development so that cellular-scale information can be extracted by fusing the different views. Finally, since the embryo covers the entire field of view of the camera, which is required to obtain a cellular-scale resolution, this protocol details the process of using bead information from above or below the embryo for the registration of the different views.

ABSTRACT:
Retinal capillary degeneration is a clinical hallmark of the early stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Our recent studies have revealed that diabetes-induced retinal capillary stiffening plays a crucial and previously unrecognized causal role in inflammation-mediated degeneration of retinal capillaries. The increase in retinal capillary stiffness results from the overexpression of lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that crosslinks and stiffens the subendothelial matrix. Since tackling DR at the early stage is expected to prevent or slow down DR progression and associated vision loss, subendothelial matrix, and capillary stiffness represent relevant and novel therapeutic targets for early DR management. Further, direct measurement of retinal capillary stiffness can serve as a crucial preclinical validation step for the development of new imaging techniques for non-invasive assessment of retinal capillary stiffness in animal and human subjects. With this view in mind, we here provide a detailed protocol for the isolation and stiffness measurement of mouse retinal capillaries and subendothelial matrix using atomic force microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Retinal organoids (ROs) are a three-dimensional culture system mimicking human retinal features that have differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) under specific conditions. Synapse development and maturation in ROs have been studied immunocytochemically and functionally. However, the direct evidence of the synaptic contact ultrastructure is limited, containing both special ribbon synapses and conventional chemical synapses. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is characterized by high resolution and a respectable history elucidating retinal development and synapse maturation in humans and various species. It is a powerful tool to explore synaptic structure in ROs and is widely used in the research field of ROs. Therefore, to better explore the structure of RO synaptic contacts at the nanoscale and obtain high-quality microscopic evidence, we developed a simple and repeatable method of RO TEM sample preparation. This paper describes the protocol, reagents used, and detailed steps, including RO fixation preparation, post fixation, embedding, and visualization.

ABSTRACT:
Volume electron microscopy (Volume EM) has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing the 3D structure of cells and tissues with nanometer-level precision. Within the retina, various types of neurons establish synaptic connections in the inner and outer plexiform layers. While conventional EM techniques have yielded valuable insights into retinal subcellular organelles, their limitation lies in providing 2D image data, which can hinder accurate measurements. For instance, quantifying the size of three distinct synaptic vesicle pools, crucial for synaptic transmission, is challenging in 2D. Volume EM offers a solution by providing large-scale, high-resolution 3D data. It is worth noting that sample preparation is a critical step in Volume EM, significantly impacting image clarity and contrast. In this context, we outline a sample preparation protocol for the 3D reconstruction of photoreceptor axon terminals in the retina. This protocol includes three key steps: retina dissection and fixation, sample embedding processes, and selection of the area of interest.

DOI: 10.3791/66759

ABSTRACT:
Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death is increased in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This can contribute to defects in intestinal barrier function, exacerbation of inflammation, and disease immunopathogenesis. Cytokines and death receptor ligands are partially responsible for this increase in IEC death. IBD-relevant cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, are cytotoxic to IECs both independently and in combination. This protocol describes a simple and practical assay to quantify cytokine-induced cytotoxicity in CD patient-derived colonic organoids using a fluorescent cell death dye (SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain), live fluorescence microscopy, and open-source image analysis software. We also demonstrate how to use the Bliss independence mathematical model to calculate a coefficient of perturbagen interaction (CPI) based on organoid cytotoxicity. The CPI can be used to determine if interactions between cytokine combinations or other types of perturbagens are antagonistic, additive, or synergistic. This protocol can be implemented to investigate the cytotoxic activity of cytokines and other perturbagens using patient-derived colonic organoids.

ABSTRACT:
In macroscale ecosystems, such as rainforests or coral reefs, the spatial localization of organisms is the basis of our understanding of community ecology. In the microbial world, likewise, microscale ecosystems are far from a random and homogeneous mixture of organisms and habitats. Accessing the spatial distribution of microbes is fundamental for understanding the functioning and ecology of the microbiota, as cohabiting species are more likely to interact and influence each other's physiology. An interkingdom microbial ecosystem is at the core of fungus-growing ant colonies, which cultivate basidiomycete fungi as a nutritional resource. Attine ants forage for diverse substrates (mostly plant-based), metabolized by the cultivated fungus while forming a spongy structure, a "microbial garden" that acts as an external gut. The garden is an intertwined mesh of fungal hyphae growing by metabolizing the substrate, opening niches for a characteristic and adapted microbiota to establish. The microbiota is thought to be a contributor to substrate degradation and fungal growth, though its spatial organization is yet to be determined. Here, we describe how we employ Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to investigate, with unprecedented detail, the microbiota and biofilm spatial organization across different fungiculture systems of fungus-growing ants. SEM imaging has provided a description of the microbiota spatial structure and organization. SEM revealed that microbiota commonly assemble in biofilms, a widespread structure of the microbial landscapes in fungiculture. We present the protocols employed to fix, dehydrate, dry, sputter coating, and image such a complex community. These protocols were optimized to deal with delicate and heterogeneous samples, comprising plant and fungal biomass, as well as the microbiota and the biofilm.

ABSTRACT:
Mosquitoes, notorious as the deadliest animals to humans due to their capacity to transmit diseases, pose a persistent challenge to public health. The primary prevention strategy currently in use involves chemical repellents, which often prove ineffective as mosquitoes rapidly develop resistance. Consequently, the invention of new preventive methods is crucial. Such development hinges on a thorough understanding of mosquito biting behaviors, necessitating an experimental setup that accurately replicates actual biting scenarios with controllable testing parameters and quantitative measurements. To bridge this gap, a bio-hybrid atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe was engineered, featuring a biological stinger - specifically, a mosquito labrum - as its tip. This bio-hybrid probe, compatible with standard AFM systems, enables a near-authentic simulation of mosquito penetration behaviors. This method marks a step forward in the quantitative study of biting mechanisms, potentially leading to the creation of effective barriers against vector-borne diseases (VBDs) and opening new avenues in the fight against mosquito-transmitted illnesses.

TITLE: Mitochondrial Transfer Via Tunneling Nanotubes Between Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Retinal Pigment Epithelium In Vitro.
AUTHORS: Yuan Jing, Jin Zi-Bing
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2024)
PMID: 39431799
DOI: 10.3791/66917

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondrial transfer is a normal physiological phenomenon that occurs widely among various types of cells. In the study to date, the most important pathway for mitochondrial transport is through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). There have been many studies reporting that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can transfer mitochondria to other cells by TNTs. However, few studies have demonstrated the phenomenon of bidirectional mitochondrial transfer. Here, our protocol describes an experimental approach to study the phenomenon of mitochondrial transfer between MSCs and retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro by two mitochondrial tracing methods. We co-cultured mito-GFP-transfected MSCs with mito-RFP-transfected ARPE19 cells (a retinal pigment epithelial cell line) for 24 h. Then, all cells were stained with phalloidin and imaged by confocal microscopy. We observed mitochondria with green fluorescence in ARPE19 cells and mitochondria with red fluorescence in MSCs, indicating that bidirectional mitochondrial transfer occurs between MSCs and ARPE19 cells. This phenomenon suggests that mitochondrial transport is a normal physiological phenomenon that also occurs between MSCs and ARPE19 cells, and mitochondrial transfer from MSCs to ARPE19 cells occurs much more frequently than vice versa. Our results indicate that MSCs can transfer mitochondria into retinal pigment epithelium, and similarly predict that MSCs can fulfill their therapeutic potential through mitochondrial transport in the retinal pigment epithelium in the future. Additionally, mitochondrial transfer from ARPE19 cells to MSCs remains to be further explored.

ABSTRACT:
Preclinical gene therapy research, particularly in rodent and large animal models, necessitates the production of AAV vectors with high yield and purity. Traditional approaches in research laboratories often involve extensive use of cell culture dishes to cultivate HEK293T cells, a process that can be both laborious and problematic. Here, a unique in-house method is presented, which simplifies this process with a specific cell factory (or cell stacks, CF10) platform. An integration of polyethylene glycol/aqueous two-phase partitioning with iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation improves both the yield and purity of the generated AAV vectors. The purity of the AAV vectors is verified through SDS-PAGE and silver staining, while the ratio of full to empty particles is determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This approach offers an efficient cell factory platform for the production of AAV vectors at high yields, coupled with an improved purification method to meet the quality demands for in vivo studies.

ABSTRACT:
Spheroid culture is a 3D model that provides an improved replication of the in vivo microenvironment compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures. Invasion is a cellular outcome of utmost interest in cancer biology. In this protocol, we have devised an alternative strategy for evaluating cancer cell invasion in vitro, employing heterospheroids comprised of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), and monocytes. These heterospheroids aim to mimic the tumor microenvironment (TME), including two relevant non-neoplastic cell types alongside the cancer cells. Each cell type was labeled with vital fluorescent markers emitting in distinct wavelengths before spheroid formation. Once formed, heterospheroids were seeded onto a layer of human leiomyoma-derived extracellular matrix in the upper compartment of a microporous membrane. Invasion was assessed in the z-axis using confocal microscopy. Digital images were obtained in the corresponding fluorescent channels at 10 µm intervals, covering a depth of 90 µm in the z-axis. Analysis was performed using freeware image software by calculating the integrated fluorescence intensity in each image and fluorescence channel. This approach enables a more dynamic analysis of cell invasion patterns in a multilayered context, as well as the examination of spatial co-localization of different cell types during invasion.

ABSTRACT:
Retinal pericytes are essential for vascular development and stability of the retina, playing a key role in maintaining the integrity of the retinal vasculature. To provide a detailed view of the morphological characteristics of pericytes, this study described a new approach combining the retro-orbital injection of a fluorescent agent, immunofluorescent-staining, and tissue-clearing treatment. Firstly, the fluorescent tomato lectin was injected into the retro-orbital sinus of the live mouse to label the retinal vasculature. After 5 min, the mouse was sacrificed, and its intact retina was carefully removed from the retinal cup and immunofluorescently stained with platelet-derived growth factor receptor β to reveal the pericytes. Additionally, the stained retina was treated with tissue-clearing reagent and whole mounted on the microscope slide. Through these approaches, the retinal vasculature and pericytes were clearly observed in the transparent retina. Under a confocal microscope, we obtained more opportunities to take high-resolution images for further reconstructing and analyzing the morphological characteristics of pericytes along the retinal vascular tree in a three-dimensional view. Methodologically, this protocol offers an effective approach for visualizing pericytes within the retinal vasculature, providing valuable insights into their role under both physiological and pathological conditions.

ABSTRACT:
Plasmids play a vital role in synthetic biology by enabling the introduction and expression of foreign genes in various organisms, thereby facilitating the construction of biological circuits and pathways within and between cell populations. For many applications, maintaining functional plasmids without antibiotic selection is critical. This study introduces an open-hardware-based microfluidic workflow for analyzing plasmid retention by culturing single cells in gel microdroplets and quantifying microcolonies using fluorescence microscopy. This approach allows for the parallel analysis of numerous droplets and microcolonies, providing greater statistical power compared to traditional plate counting and enabling the integration of the assay into other droplet microfluidic workflows. By using plasmids expressing fluorescent proteins alongside a non-specific fluorescent DNA stain, single colonies can be identified and differentiated based on plasmid loss or fluorescent marker expression. Notably, this advanced workflow, implemented with open-source hardware, offers precise flow control and temperature management of both the sample and the microfluidic chip. These features enhance the workflow's ease of use, robustness, and accessibility. While the study focuses on Escherichia coli as the experimental model, the method's true potential lies in its versatility. It can be adapted for various studies requiring fluorescence signal quantification from plasmids or stains, as well as for other applications. The adoption of open-source hardware broadens the potential for conducting high-throughput bioanalyses using accessible technology in diverse research settings.

ABSTRACT:
Neutrophils play an important role in innate immune defense by using several strategies, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a process referred to as NETosis. However, in the past two decades, it has become clear that the accumulation of NETs in tissues contributes to the pathophysiology of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, interest in the development of NETosis antagonists has risen. Variable and non-standardized methods to detect and analyze NETosis were developed concomitantly, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here, we describe a real-time microscopy method for the quantification of human NET release, allowing to study NETosis as well as NET inhibition in a high-throughput manner. The surface area-based semi-automated analysis recognizes NETs and distinguishes them from non-netting activated neutrophils. We demonstrate that the non-physiological NETosis inducers, calcium ionophore and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), trigger the release of NETs with different characteristics and kinetics. Furthermore, we show that this approach allows studying NET release in response to disease-relevant stimuli, including immune complexes, N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF), monosodium urate crystals, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals. To exemplify the utility of this method to study NETosis antagonists, we used CIT-013, a first-in-class monoclonal antibody inhibitor of NET release. CIT-013 targets citrullinated histone H2A and H4 and efficiently inhibits NET release with an IC50 of 4.6 nM. Other anti-histone antibodies tested lacked this NETosis-inhibitory capacity. Altogether, we demonstrate that this protocol enables specific, reliable, and reproducible high-throughput quantification of NETs, enhancing the study of NET release characteristics, kinetics, and pharmacology of NETosis antagonists.

ABSTRACT:
Foreign body reaction (FBR), an immune-mediated complex healing process, plays a crucial role in integrating implants into the body. Macrophages, as the first line of immune system interaction with implant surfaces, play a bidirectional role in modulating the inflammation-regeneration balance. For a deep understanding and the evaluation of the reactions between implant materials and immune responses, reliable in vitro methods and protocols are pivotal. Among different in vitro models, primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) present an excellent model for investigating macrophage-implant interactions. We have implemented an experimental protocol to evaluate the polarization of MDMs into M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated) macrophages on implant surfaces. We isolated blood monocytes from healthy donors and differentiated them into macrophages using macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Differentiated macrophages were cultured on implant surfaces and polarized into M1 and M2 subtypes. M1 polarization was achieved in the presence of interferon (IFN)-γ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while M2 polarization was performed in a medium containing interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. We evaluated macrophage phenotypes by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) based on panels of secreted cytokines, cell surface markers, and expressed genes. The extracted RNA was transformed into complementary DNA (cDNA), and qRT-PCR was used to quantify mRNA related to M1 and M2 macrophages. Accordingly, M1 macrophages have been characterized by higher expression of proinflammatory Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) cytokine and CCR7 surface marker compared to M2 macrophages, which exhibited higher levels of CD209 and CCL13. Consequently, CCR7 and CD209 were identified as specific and reliable markers of M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes by immunostaining and visualizing by CLSM. Further confirmation was achieved by ELISA detecting elevated TNF-ɑ level in M1 and increased CCL13 in M2 cells. The proposed markers and experimental setup can be used effectively to assess the immunomodulatory potential of implants.

ABSTRACT:
Deciphering the protein-ligand interactions in a macromolecular complex is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism, underlying biological processes, and drug development. In recent years, cryogenic sample electron microscopy (cryoEM) has emerged as a powerful technique to determine the structures of macromolecules and to investigate the mode of ligand binding at near-atomic resolution. Identifying and modeling non-protein molecules in cryoEM maps is often challenging due to anisotropic resolution across the molecule of interest and inherent noise in the data. In this article, the readers are introduced to various software and methods currently used for ligand identification, model building, and refinement of atomic coordinates using selected macromolecules. One of the simplest ways to identify the presence of a ligand, as illustrated with the enolase enzyme, is to subtract the two maps obtained with and without the ligand. The extra density of the ligand is likely to stand out in the difference map even at a higher threshold. There are instances, as shown in the case of metabotropic Glutamate receptor mGlu5, when such simple difference maps cannot be generated. The recently introduced method of deriving the Fo-Fc omit map can serve as a tool for validating and demonstrating the presence of the ligand. Finally, using the well-studied β-galactosidase as an example, the effect of resolution on modeling the ligands and solvent molecules in cryoEM maps is analyzed, and an outlook on how cryoEM can be used in drug discovery is presented.

ABSTRACT:
Single cell Ca2+ imaging is essential for the study of Ca2+ channels activated by various stimulations like temperature, voltage, native compound and chemicals et al. It primarily relies on microscopy imaging technology and the related Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM (AM is the abbreviation for Acetoxymethyl ester). Inside the cells, Fura-2/AM is hydrolyzed by esterases into Fura-2, which can reversibly bind with free cytoplasmic Ca2+. The maximum excitation wavelength shifts from 380nm to 340nm (when saturated with Ca2+) upon binding. The emitted fluorescence intensity is quantitatively related to the concentration of bound Ca2+. By measuring the 340/380 ratio, the Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm can be determined, eliminating errors caused by variations in the loading efficiency of the fluorescent probe among different samples. This technology allows for real-time, quantitative, and simultaneous monitoring of Ca2+ changes in multiple cells. The results are stored in ".XLSX" format for subsequent analysis, which is fast and generates intuitive change curves, greatly improving the detection efficiency. From different experimental perspectives, this article lists the use of this technology to detect Ca2+ signals in cells with endogenous or overexpressed channel proteins. Meantime, different methods for activating cells were also showed and compared. The aim is to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the usage and applications of single cell Ca2+ imaging.

TITLE: Simplified Volumetric Models as an Effective Strategy for Segmenting Actin Networks in Cryo-Electron Tomograms.
AUTHORS: Song Junha, Auer Manfred
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2024)
PMID: 38801255
DOI: 10.3791/64845

ABSTRACT:
Efficient methods for the extraction of features of interest remain one of the biggest challenges for the interpretation of cryo-electron tomograms. Various automated approaches have been proposed, many of which work well for high-contrast datasets where the features of interest can be easily detected and are clearly separated from one another. Our inner ear stereocilia cryo-electron tomographic datasets are characterized by a dense array of hexagonally packed actin filaments that are frequently cross-connected. These features make automated segmentation very challenging, further aggravated by the high-noise environment of cryo-electron tomograms and the high complexity of the densely packed features. Using prior knowledge about the actin bundle organization, we have placed layers of a highly simplified ball-and-stick actin model to first obtain a global fit to the density map, followed by regional and local adjustments of the model. We show that volumetric model building not only allows us to deal with the high complexity, but also provides precise measurements and statistics about the actin bundle. Volumetric models also serve as anchoring points for local segmentation, such as in the case of the actin-actin cross connectors. Volumetric model building, particularly when further augmented by computer-based automated fitting approaches, can be a powerful alternative when conventional automated segmentation approaches are not successful.

ABSTRACT:
Eukaryotes have one replicative helicase known as CMG, which centrally organizes and drives the replisome, and leads the way at the front of replication forks. Obtaining a deep mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of CMG is critical to elucidating how cells achieve the enormous task of efficiently and accurately replicating their entire genome once per cell cycle. Single-molecule techniques are uniquely suited to quantify the dynamics of CMG due to their unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution. Nevertheless, single-molecule studies of CMG motion have thus far relied on pre-formed CMG purified from cells as a complex, which precludes the study of the steps leading up to its activation. Here, we describe a hybrid ensemble and single-molecule assay that allowed imaging at the single-molecule level of the motion of fluorescently labeled CMG after fully reconstituting its assembly and activation from 36 different purified S. cerevisiae polypeptides. This assay relies on the double functionalization of the ends of a linear DNA substrate with two orthogonal attachment moieties, and can be adapted to study similarly complex DNA-processing mechanisms at the single-molecule level.

ABSTRACT:
Catheter-related infection (CRI) is a common nosocomial infection caused by candida albicans during catheter implantation. Typically, biofilms are formed on the outer surface of the catheter and lead to disseminated infections, which are fatal to patients. There are no effective prevention and treatment management in clinics. Therefore, it is urgent to establish an animal model of CRI for the preclinical screening of new strategies for its prevention and treatment. In this study, a polyethylene catheter, a widely used medical catheter, was inserted into the back of the BALB/c mice after hair removal. Candida albicans ATCC MYA-2876 (SC5314) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein was subsequently inoculated on the skin's surface along the catheter. Intense fluorescence was observed on the surface of the catheter under a fluorescent microscope 3 days later. Mature and thick biofilms were found on the surface of the catheter via scanning electron microscopy. These results indicated the adhesion, colonization, and biofilm formation of candida albicans on the surface of the catheter. The hyperplasia of the epidermis and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the skin specimens indicated the histopathological changes of the CRI-associated skin. To sum up, a mouse CRI model was successfully established. This model is expected to be helpful in the research and development of therapeutic management for candida albicans associated CRI.

ABSTRACT:
Neural tissue from any source is an excellent material for tubulin isolation, as the dendrites and axons of neurons are rich in microtubules. Here, we present a procedure for extracting tubulin that can be employed, with minor modifications, for neural tissue from multiple sources. In the presented protocol, a new clarification step of the crude lysate has been introduced, which led to a significant reduction in the initial amount of insoluble debris before the first polymerization step occurred. This additional step allowed the processing of additional tissue while using the same instrumentation and, thus, increasing the relative volume of the processed homogenate. The newly introduced step has no significant effect on the quality of purified tubulin, as confirmed by in vitro activity assays and transmission electron microscopy. The described procedure contains all crucial steps, including tissue collection, transport, tissue homogenization, tubulin isolation cycles, and final polishing by ion exchange chromatography using FPLC and subsequent activity measurement assays. The homogeneity of purified tubulin was more than 97%, as confirmed by MS/MS analysis utilizing electrospray ionization and MALDI-TOF.

ABSTRACT:
With the increasing demand for sustainable biotechnologies, mixed consortia containing a phototrophic microbe and heterotrophic partner species are being explored as a method for solar-driven bioproduction. One approach involves the use of CO2-fixing cyanobacteria that secrete organic carbon to support the metabolism of a co-cultivated heterotroph, which in turn transforms the carbon into higher-value goods or services. In this protocol, a technical description to assist the experimentalist in the establishment of a co-culture combining a sucrose-secreting cyanobacterial strain with a fungal partner(s), as represented by model yeast species, is provided. The protocol describes the key prerequisites for co-culture establishment: Defining the media composition, monitoring the growth characteristics of individual partners, and the analysis of mixed cultures with multiple species combined in the same growth vessel. Basic laboratory techniques for co-culture monitoring, including microscopy, cell counter, and single-cell flow cytometry, are summarized, and examples of nonproprietary software to use for data analysis of raw flow cytometry standard (FCS) files in line with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles are provided. Finally, commentary on the bottlenecks and pitfalls frequently encountered when attempting to establish a co-culture with sugar-secreting cyanobacteria and a novel heterotrophic partner is included. This protocol provides a resource for researchers attempting to establish a new pair of co-cultured microbes that includes a cyanobacterium and a heterotrophic microbe.

ABSTRACT:
Cauda equina herniation (CEH) is a relatively rare and severe perioperative complication that may occur after lumbar spine surgery. Here, we present a case report of a 36-year-old female patient who experienced CEH after an endoscopic L5-S1 laminectomy and discectomy. The patient presented with right L5-S1 radiculopathy that correlated with findings in medical imaging and physical examination. Subsequently, she underwent endoscopic L5-S1 laminotomy and discectomy. A day after the operation, the patient developed urine leakage, hematochezia, aggravated constipation, and found no relief from pain in the right lower limb. MRI revealed cerebrospinal fluid leakage at the surgical site. After consultation with the urology and anorectal department, the patient was fitted with a urinary catheter, prescribed hemorrhoid medication, and underwent anal sphincter training as recommended by the doctor. After 1 week of treatment, the patient's urinary function returned to normal, but constipation persisted while the pain in the right lower limb eased. After 5 months, the patient was hospitalized due to radiating pain in both lower limbs and constipation. An MRI revealed herniation of the L5/S1 nerve root sac. Subsequently, L5/S1 total laminectomy decompression and dural sac repair were performed under a three-dimensional (3D) microscopy. Postoperatively, lower limb pain and constipation were alleviated. CEH following spinal endoscopy, though rare, demands significant clinical attention. The successful outcome in this case illustrates the value of surgical revision under 3D microscopic guidance, offering a viable strategy for patients presenting with this complication.

ABSTRACT:
The cell membrane is crucial for cell survival, and ensuring its integrity is essential as the cell experiences injuries throughout its entire life cycle. To prevent damage to the membrane, cells have developed efficient plasma membrane repair mechanisms. These repair mechanisms can be studied by combining confocal microscopy and nanoscale thermoplasmonics to identify and investigate the role of key proteins, such as annexins, involved in surface repair in living cells and membrane model systems. The puncturing method employs a laser to induce highly localized heating upon nanoparticle irradiation. The use of near-infrared light minimizes phototoxicity in the biological sample, while the majority of the absorption takes place in the near-infrared resonant plasmonic nanoparticle. This thermoplasmonic method has been exploited for potential photothermal and biophysical research to enhance the understanding of intracellular mechanisms and cellular responses through vesicle and cell fusion studies. The approach has shown to be complementary to existing methods for membrane disruption, such as mechanically, chemically, or optically induced injuries, and provides a high level of control by inflicting extremely localized injuries. The extent of the injury is limited to the vicinity of the spherical nanoparticle, and no detrimental damage occurs along the beam path as opposed to pulsed lasers using different wavelengths. Despite certain limitations, such as the formation of nanobubbles, the thermoplasmonic method offers a unique tool for investigating cellular responses in plasma membrane repair in an almost native environment without compromising cell viability. When integrated with confocal microscopy, the puncturing method can provide a mechanistic understanding of membrane dynamics in model membrane systems as well as quantitative information on protein responses to membrane damage, including protein recruitment and their biophysical function. Overall, the application of this method to reduced model systems can enhance our understanding of the intricate plasma membrane repair machinery in living cells.

ABSTRACT:
We report a fast, easy-to-implement, highly sensitive, sequence-specific, and point-of-care (POC) DNA virus detection system, which combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR/Cas12a system for trace detection of DNA viruses. Target DNA is amplified and recognized by RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a separately, which triggers the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a that cleaves a fluorophore-quencher labeled DNA reporter and generalizes fluorescence. For POC detection, portable smartphone microscopy is built to take fluorescent images. Besides, deep learning models for binary classification of positive or negative samples, achieving high accuracy, are deployed within the system. Frog virus 3 (FV3, genera Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae) was tested as an example for this DNA virus POC detection system, and the limits of detection (LoD) can achieve 10 aM within 40 min. Without skilled operators and bulky instruments, the portable and miniature RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a-SPM with artificial intelligence (AI) assisted classification shows great potential for POC DNA virus detection and can help prevent the spread of such viruses.

TITLE: Development of a Polymicrobial Colony Biofilm Model to Test Antimicrobials in Cystic Fibrosis.

ABSTRACT:
A range of bacteria biofilm models exist for the testing of antibiotics. However, many of these are limited to a single experimental output, such as colony-forming units or metabolic activity. Furthermore, many biofilm models do not reflect the biological and physiochemical properties of the human host environment. This is an important issue in many conditions, but most noticeably in cystic fibrosis (CF). A large proportion of people with CF suffer from both chronic and intermittent infections, and in vitro, antibiotic susceptibility testing poorly correlates with patient treatment outcomes. Some biofilm models incorporate CF lung-relevant media, including synthetic sputum mimics, but do not consider the polymicrobial nature of the environment, which alters biofilm architecture, physiology, and the way microbes respond to treatment. The solid-air interface colony biofilm model described here is highly adaptable and incorporates both CF-relevant media and a polymicrobial context. This model can also be used for mid-throughput screening of antimicrobials and to study their effect on polymicrobial dynamics. Output measurements from the model can be colony-forming units, metabolic activity, and confocal microscopy analysis. The model can easily be adapted to different microorganisms, media, temperatures, and variable oxygen conditions and can be used to test a wide range of chemical, biological, and physical treatments.

TITLE: A Set of Screening Techniques for a Quick Overview of the Neutrophil Function.

ABSTRACT:
Neutrophils are known as one of the first lines of defense in the innate immune response and can perform many particular cellular functions, such as chemotaxis, reverse migration, phagocytosis, degranulation of cytotoxic enzymes and metabolites, and release of DNA as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils not only have tightly regulated signaling themselves, but also participate in the regulation of other components of the immune system. As fresh neutrophils are terminally differentiated, short-lived, and highly variable among individuals, it is important to make the most of the collected samples. Researchers often need to perform screening assays to assess an overview of the many neutrophil functions that may be affected by specific conditions under evaluation. A set of tests following a single isolation process of normal density neutrophils was developed to address this need, seeking a balance between speed, comprehensiveness, cost, and accuracy. The results can be used to reason and guide in-depth follow-up studies. This procedure can be carried out in an average time of 4 h and includes the evaluation of cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, real-time migration, and phagocytosis of yeast on glass slides, leaving enough cells for more detailed approaches like omics studies. Moreover, the procedure includes a way to easily observe a preliminary suggestion of NETs after fast panoptic staining observed by light microscopy, with a lack of specific markers, albeit enough to indicate if further efforts in that way would be worthwhile. The diversity of functions tested combines common points among tests, reducing the analysis time and expenses. The procedure was named NeutroFun Screen, and although having limitations, it balances the aforementioned factors. Furthermore, the aim of this work is not a definite test set, but rather a guideline that can easily be adjusted to each lab's resources and demands.

TITLE: A Toxicological and Ecotoxicological Assay Based on Mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) Hemocytes Motility.
AUTHORS: Udayan Gayatri, Giordano Maria Elena, Pagliara Patrizia, Lionetto Maria Giulia

ABSTRACT:
Hemocytes are the circulating immune-competent cells in bivalve mollusks and play a key role in several important functions of cell-mediated innate immunity. During the early stages of the immune response, hemocytes actively migrate to the site of infection. This inherent motility is a fundamental characteristic of these cells. It represents a key cellular function that integrates multiple processes, such as cell adhesion, cell signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and changes in cell volume. Therefore, alterations in cell motility following exposure to drugs or pollutants can serve as a useful toxicological endpoint. Despite the fundamental role of cell motility in cellular physiology, it has been poorly investigated from a toxicological perspective. This work proposes a novel in vitro method for the rapid and sensitive assessment of the toxicity and ecotoxicity of pollutants, based on evaluating the hemocyte motility of Mytilus galloprovincialis. We developed a cell motility assay on hemocytes adhering to the bottom of a 96-well polystyrene microplate. Following exposure to increasing concentrations of drugs, cell trajectories, and velocities were quantified by cell tracking under time-lapse microscopy, allowing us to measure the effects on hemocyte motility. Due to the ease of hemocyte collection from the animals in a relatively non-invasive manner, the proposed method offers an alternative test for screening the effects and mechanisms of action of pollutants and drugs. It aligns with the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) criteria, addressing ethical concerns and contributing to the reduction of vertebrate in vivo animal testing.

ABSTRACT:
Various nuclear processes, such as transcriptional control, occur within discrete structures known as foci that are discernable through the immunofluorescence technique. Investigating the dynamics of these foci under diverse cellular conditions via microscopy yields valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing cellular identity and functions. However, performing immunofluorescence assays across different cell types and assessing alterations in the assembly, diffusion, and distribution of these foci present numerous challenges. These challenges encompass complexities in sample preparation, determination of parameters for analyzing imaging data, and management of substantial data volumes. Moreover, existing imaging workflows are often tailored for proficient users, thereby limiting accessibility to a broader audience. In this study, we introduce an optimized immunofluorescence protocol tailored for investigating nuclear proteins in different human primary T cell types that can be customized for any protein of interest and cell type. Furthermore, we present a method for unbiasedly quantifying protein staining, whether they form distinct foci or exhibit a diffuse nuclear distribution. Our proposed method offers a comprehensive guide, from cellular staining to analysis, leveraging a semi-automated pipeline developed in Jython and executable in Fiji. Furthermore, we provide a user-friendly Python script to streamline data management, publicly accessible on a Google Colab notebook. Our approach has demonstrated efficacy in yielding highly informative immunofluorescence analyses for proteins with diverse patterns of nuclear organization across different contexts.

TITLE: LPS and ATP-induced Death of PMA-differentiated THP-1 Macrophages and its Validation.

ABSTRACT:
Cell death is a fundamental process in all living organisms. The protocol establishes a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated lipid deposition in human monocyte (THP-1) macrophage model to observe cell death. LPS combined with ATP is a classic inflammatory induction method, often used to study pyroptosis, but apoptosis and necroptosis also respond to stimulation by LPS/ATP. Under normal circumstances, phosphatidylserine is only localized in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, in the early stages of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, the cell membrane remains intact and exposed to phosphatidylserine, and in the later stages, the cell membrane loses its integrity. Here, flow cytometry was used to analyze Annexin V and 7-Aminoactinomycin D (AAD) double staining to detect the cell death from the whole cells. The results show that substantial cells died after stimulation with LPS/ATP. Using scanning electron microscopy, we observe the possible forms of cell death in individual cells. The results indicate that cells may undergo pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis after stimulation with LPS/ATP. This protocol focuses on observing the death of macrophages after stimulation with LPS/ATP. The results showed that cell death after LPS and ATP stimulation is not limited to pyroptosis and that apoptosis and necrotic apoptosis can also occur, helping researchers better understand cell death after LPS and ATP stimulation and choose a better experimental method.

TITLE: Synthesis and Characterization of Self-Assembled Metal-Organic Framework Monolayers using Polymer-coated Particles.
AUTHORS: Kang Minjung, Cohen Seth M
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2024)
PMID: 38949297
DOI: 10.3791/66497

ABSTRACT:
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials with potential applications in fields such as gas adsorption and separation, catalysis, and biomedicine. Attempts to enhance the utility of MOFs have involved the preparation of various composites, including polymer-grafted MOFs. By directly grafting polymers to the external surface of MOFs, issues of incompatibility between polymers and MOFs can be overcome. Polymer brushes grafted from the surface of MOFs can serve to stabilize the MOF while enabling particle assembly into self-assembled metal-organic framework monolayers (SAMMs) via polymer-polymer interactions. Control over the chemical composition and molecular weight of the grafted polymer can allow for tuning of the SAMM characteristics. In this work, instructions are provided on how to immobilize a chain transfer agent (CTA) onto the surface of the MOF UiO-66 (UiO = Universitetet i Oslo). The CTA serves as initiation sites for the growth of polymers. Once polymer chains are grown from the MOF surface, the formation of SAMMs is achieved through self-assembly at an air-water interface. The resulting SAMMs are characterized and shown to be freestanding by scanning electron microscopy imaging. The methods presented in this paper are expected to make the preparation of SAMMs more accessible to the research community and thereby expand their potential use as a MOF-polymer composite.

ABSTRACT:
The extensive characterization of tissue mineralization in the context of bone regeneration represents a significant challenge, given the numerous modalities that are currently available for analysis. Here, we propose a workflow for a comprehensive evaluation of new bone formation using a relevant large animal osseous ex vivo explant. A bone defect (diameter = 3.75 mm; depth = 5.0 mm) is created in an explanted sheep femoral head and injected with a macroporous bone substitute loaded with a pro-osteogenic growth factor (bone morphogenetic protein 2 - BMP2). Subsequently, the explant is maintained in culture for a 28-day period, allowing cellular colonization and subsequent bone formation. To evaluate the quality and structure of newly mineralized tissue, the following successive methods are set up: (i) Characterization and high-resolution 3D images of the entire explant using micro-CT, followed by deep learning image analyses to enhance the discrimination of mineralized tissues; (ii) Nano-indentation to determine the mechanical properties of the newly formed tissue; (iii) Histological examinations, such as Hematoxylin/Eosin/Saffron (HES), Goldner's trichrome, and Movat's pentachrome to provide a qualitative assessment of mineralized tissue, particularly with regard to the visualization of the osteoid barrier and the presence of bone cells; (iv) Back-scattering scanning electron microscopy (SEM) mapping with internal reference to quantify the degree of mineralization and provide detailed insights into surface morphology, mineral composition, and bone-biomaterial interface; (v) Raman spectroscopy to characterize the molecular composition of the mineralized matrix and to provide insights into the persistence of BMP2 within the cement through the detection of peptide bonds. This multimodal analysis will provide an effective assessment of newly formed bone and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative insights into mineralized tissues. Through the standardization of these protocols, we aim to facilitate interstudy comparisons and improve the validity and reliability of research findings.

ABSTRACT:
Metastatic breast cancer is a devastating disease with very limited therapeutic options, calling for new therapeutic strategies. Oncogenic miRNAs have been shown to be associated with the metastatic potential of breast cancer and are implicated in tumor cell migration, invasion, and viability. However, it can be difficult to deliver an inhibitory RNA molecule to the tissue of interest. To overcome this challenge and deliver active antisense oligonucleotides to tumors, we utilized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as a delivery platform. These nanoparticles target tissues with increased vascular permeability, such as sites of inflammation or cancer. Delivery of these nanoparticles can be monitored in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their magnetic properties. Translation of this therapeutic approach into the clinic will be more accessible because of its compatibility with this relevant imaging modality. They can also be labeled with other imaging reporters such as a Cy5.5 near-infrared optical dye for correlative optical imaging and fluorescence microscopy. Here, we demonstrate that nanoparticles labeled with Cy5.5 and conjugated to therapeutic oligomers targeting oncogenic miRNA-10b (termed MN-anti-miR10b, or "nanodrug") administered intravenously accumulate in metastatic sites, opening a possibility for therapeutic intervention of metastatic breast cancer.

ABSTRACT:
In the heart, ion channels generate electrical currents that signal muscle contraction through changes in intracellular calcium concentration, i.e., [Ca2+]. The cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) is the predominant ion channel responsible for increasing intracellular [Ca2+] by releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Timely Ca2+ release is necessary for appropriate cardiac function, and dysfunction can cause or contribute to life-threatening diseases such as arrhythmia. Quantification of SR-Ca2+ release in the form of sparks and waves can provide valuable insight into RyR2 opening, and factors that influence or regulate channel function. Here, we provide a series of protocols that outline processes for (1) obtaining high-quality isolated cardiomyocytes, (2) preparing samples for experimentally investigating factors that influence RyR2 function, and (3) data acquisition and analysis. Notably, our protocols leverage the potency of the recently developed myosin ATPase inhibitor, Mavacamten. This affords the opportunity to characterize the effects of small molecules or reconstituted proteins/enzymes on RyR2-Ca2+ release events across a range of [Ca2+]. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Coral reefs are invaluable ecosystems that are under threat from various anthropogenic stressors. There has been a recent increase in the diagnostic tools utilized to understand how these threats impact coral reef health. Unfortunately, the application of diagnostic tools like transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is not as standardized or developed in coral research as in other research fields. Utilizing TEM in conjunction with other diagnostic methods can aid in understanding the impact of these stressors on the cellular level because TEM offers valuable insight into the structures and microsymbionts associated with coral tissue that cannot be obtained with a conventional light microscope. Additionally, a significant amount of coral tissue ultrastructure has not yet been extensively described, causing a considerable gap in our understanding of cellular structures that could relate to the immune response, cellular function, or symbioses. Moreover, additional standardization is needed for TEM in coral research to increase comparability and reproducibility of findings across studies. Here, we present standardized TEM sample fixation, embedding, and sectioning techniques for coral studies that ensure consistent ultrastructural preservation and minimize artifacts, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of TEM observations. We also demonstrate that these TEM protocols allow for the observation and quantification of bacterial and viral-like particles within the coral tissue as well as the endosymbiotic microalgae, potentially providing insight into their interactions within coral cells and how they relate to overall coral health and resilience. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT:
Intracellular bacterial pathogens implement a diverse array of strategies to target host cells and establish infection. For vacuolar pathogens, the process of pathogen-containing vacuole movement within host cells, termed intracellular trafficking, is central to both pathogen survival and infection progression. Typically a process mediated by secreted virulence factors that manipulate the host cytoskeletal machinery, internalized pathogen-containing vacuoles traffic to the site of replication to establish a unique replicative niche, and if applicable, traffic back toward the host cell periphery for cell-to-cell spread. As such, the intracellular positioning of pathogen-containing vacuoles represents a fundamental measure of infection progression. Here, we describe a fluorescence microscopy-based method to quantitatively assess bacterial intracellular positioning, using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of epithelial cells as a model. This experimental approach can be modified to study infection in diverse host cell types, and with a broad array of pathogens. The system can also be adapted to examine the kinetics of infection, identify secreted virulence factors that mediate host trafficking, investigate host factors that are targeted by the pathogen for trafficking, and assess functional domains within a virulence factor responsible for mediating the phenotype. Collectively, these tools can provide fundamental insight into the pathogenesis of a diverse array of intracellular bacterial pathogens, and new host factors that are hijacked to mediate infection. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT:
Investigating the function of target proteins for functional prospection or therapeutic applications typically requires the production and purification of recombinant proteins. The fusion of these proteins with tag peptides and fluorescently derived proteins allows the monitoring of candidate proteins using SDS-PAGE coupled with western blotting and fluorescent microscopy, respectively. However, protein engineering poses a significant challenge for many researchers. In this protocol, we describe step-by-step the engineering of a recombinant protein with various tags: TAT-HA (trans-activator of transduction-hemagglutinin), 6×His and EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) or mCherry. Fusion proteins are produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) column. Then, tagged recombinant proteins are introduced into cultured animal cells by using the penetrating peptide TAT-HA. Here, we present a thorough protocol providing a detailed guide encompassing every critical step from plasmid DNA molecular assembly to protein expression and subsequent purification and outlines the conditions necessary for protein transduction technology into animal cells in a comprehensive manner. We believe that this protocol will be a valuable resource for researchers seeking an exhaustive, step-by-step guide for the successful production and purification of recombinant proteins and their entry by transduction within living cells. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT:
Speckle with non-Rayleigh amplitude distribution has significant research value in imaging and measurement using structured illumination. However, existing speckle customizing schemes have been limited in generation speed due to the refresh rate of spatial light modulators (SLMs). In this work, we proposed a method to rapidly generate non-Rayleigh distributed speckle fields using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). In contrast to SLMs that allow for gray-scale phase modulation, DMD is limited to binary amplitude control. To solve this limitation, we design a Gerchberg-Saxton-like algorithm based on super-pixel method, this algorithm enables the customization of non-Rayleigh speckle with arbitrary intensity probability density function. Statistical analyses of experimental results have demonstrated that the customized speckles exhibit excellent stability in their lateral statistical properties, while also maintaining consistent propagation characteristics with Rayleigh speckle in the longitudinal direction. This method provides a new approach for high-speed and arbitrary intensity speckle customization, holding potential applications in imaging, measurement, and encryption fields.

ABSTRACT:
Far-red and near-infrared fluorescent proteins have regions of maximum transmission in most tissues and can be widely used as fluorescent biomarkers. We report that fluorescent phycobiliproteins originating from the phycobilisome core subunit ApcF2 can covalently bind biliverdin, named BDFPs. To further improve BDFPs, we conducted a series of studies. Firstly, we mutated K53Q and T144A of BDFPs to increase their effective brightness up to 190 % in vivo. Secondly, by homochromatic tandem fusion of high-brightness BDFPs to achieve monomerization, which increases the effective brightness by up to 180 % in vivo, and can effectively improve the labeling effect. By combining the above two approaches, the brightness of the tandem BDFPs was much improved compared with that of the previously reported fluorescent proteins in a similar spectral range. The tandem BDFPs were expressed stably while maintaining fluorescence in mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans. They were also photostable and resistant to high temperature, low pH, and chemical denaturation. The tandem BDFPs advantages were proved in applications as biomarkers for imaging in super-resolution microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Understanding the dynamic features of the cell organelle ultrastructure, which is not only rich in unknown information but also sophisticated from a three-dimensional (3D) perspective, is critical for mechanistic studies. Electron microscopy (EM) offers good imaging depth and allows for the reconstruction of high-resolution image stacks to investigate the ultrastructural morphology of cellular organelles even at the nanometer scale; therefore, 3D reconstruction is gaining importance due to its incomparable advantages. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides a high-throughput image acquisition technology that allows for reconstructing large structures in 3D from the same region of interest in consecutive slices. Therefore, the application of SEM in large-scale 3D reconstruction to restore the true 3D ultrastructure of organelles is becoming increasingly common. In this protocol, we suggest a combination of serial ultrathin section and 3D reconstruction techniques to study mitochondrial cristae in pancreatic cancer cells. The details of how these techniques are performed are described in this protocol in a step-by-step manner, including the osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium (OTO) method, the serial ultrathin section imaging, and the visualization display.

ABSTRACT:
Microtubules are an important part of the cytoskeleton and are involved in intracellular organization, cell division, and migration. Depending on the posttranslational modifications, microtubules can form complexes with various interacting proteins. These microtubule-protein complexes are often implicated in human diseases. Understanding the structure of such complexes is useful for elucidating their mechanisms of action and can be studied by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). To obtain such complexes for structural studies, it is important to extract microtubules containing or lacking specific posttranslational modifications. Here, we describe a simplified protocol to extract endogenous tubulin from genetically modified mammalian cells, involving microtubule polymerization, followed by sedimentation using ultracentrifugation. The extracted tubulin can then be used to prepare cryo-electron microscope grids with microtubules that are bound to a purified microtubule-binding protein of interest. As an example, we demonstrate the extraction of fully tyrosinated microtubules from cell lines engineered to lack the three known tubulin-detyrosinating enzymes. These microtubules are then used to make a protein complex with enzymatically inactive microtubule-associated tubulin detyrosinase on cryo-EM grids.

ABSTRACT:
The goal of this protocol is to describe fiber-optic-bundle-coupled pre-clinical confocal laser-scanning endomicroscopy (pCLE) in its specific application to elucidate capillary blood flow effects during seizures, driven by mural cells. In vitro and in vivo cortical imaging have shown that capillary constrictions driven by pericytes can result from functional local neural activity, as well as from drug application, in healthy animals. Here, a protocol is presented on how to use pCLE to determine the role of microvascular dynamics in neural degeneration in epilepsy, at any tissue depth (specifically in the hippocampus). We describe a head restraint technique that has been adapted to record pCLE in awake animals, to address potential side-effects of anesthetics on neural activity. Using these methods, electrophysiological and imaging recordings can be conducted over several hours in deep neural structures of the brain.

PMID: 36744780
DOI: 10.3791/64521

ABSTRACT:
This work presents a set of comprehensive virtual experiments to detect material deformation and failure. The most commonly used pieces of equipment in mechanics and material disciplines, such as a metallographic cutting machine and a high-temperature universal creep testing machine, are integrated into a web-based system to provide different experimental services to users in an immersive and interactive learning environment. The protocol in this work is divided into five subsections, namely, the preparation of the materials, molding the specimen, specimen characterization, specimen loading, nanoindenter installation, and SEM in situ experiments, and this protocol aims to provide an opportunity for users regarding the recognition of different equipment and the corresponding operations, as well as the enhancement of laboratory awareness, etc., using a virtual simulation approach. To provide clear guidance for the experiment, the system highlights the equipment/specimen to be used in the next step and marks the pathway that leads to the equipment with a conspicuous arrow. To mimic the hands-on experiment as closely as possible, we designed and developed a three-dimensional laboratory room, equipment, operations, and experimental procedures. Moreover, the virtual system also considers interactive exercises and registration before using chemicals during the experiment. Incorrect operations are also allowed, resulting in a warning message informing the user. The system can provide interactive and visualized experiments to users at different levels.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators have contributed greatly to our understanding of neural dynamics from the level of individual neurons to entire brain circuits. However, neural responses may vary due to prior experience, internal states, or stochastic factors, thus generating the need for methods that can assess neural function across many individuals at once. Whereas most recording techniques examine a single animal at a time, we describe the use of wide-field microscopy to scale up neuronal recordings to dozens of Caenorhabditis elegans or other sub-millimeter-scale organisms at once. Open-source hardware and software allow great flexibility in programming fully automated experiments that control the intensity and timing of various stimulus types, including chemical, optical, mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic stimuli. In particular, microfluidic flow devices provide precise, repeatable, and quantitative control of chemosensory stimuli with sub-second time resolution. The NeuroTracker semi-automated data analysis pipeline then extracts individual and population-wide neural responses to uncover functional changes in neural excitability and dynamics. This paper presents examples of measuring neuronal adaptation, temporal inhibition, and stimulus crosstalk. These techniques increase the precision and repeatability of stimulation, allow the exploration of population variability, and are generalizable to other dynamic fluorescent signals in small biosystems from cells and organoids to whole organisms and plants.

ABSTRACT:
Retinal dystrophies are a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Extensive efforts are underway to develop advanced retinal prostheses that can bypass the impaired light-sensing photoreceptor cells in the degenerated retina, aiming to partially restore vision by inducing visual percepts. One common avenue of investigation involves the design and production of implantable devices with a flexible physical structure, housing a high number of electrodes. This enables the efficient and precise generation of visual percepts. However, with each technological advancement, there arises a need for a reliable and manageable ex vivo method to verify the functionality of the device before progressing to in vivo experiments, where factors beyond the device's performance come into play. This article presents a comprehensive protocol for studying calcium activity in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) following electrical stimulation. Specifically, the following steps are outlined: (1) fluorescently labeling the rat retina using genetically encoded calcium indicators, (2) capturing the fluorescence signal using an inverted fluorescence microscope while applying distinct patterns of electrical stimulation, and (3) extracting and analyzing the calcium traces from individual cells within the GCL. By following this procedure, researchers can efficiently test new stimulation protocols prior to conducting in vivo experiments.

TITLE: Advances in Nanoscale Infrared Spectroscopy to Explore Multiphase Polymeric Systems.
AUTHORS: Young Rebecca, Tetard Laurene
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2023)
PMID: 37427921
DOI: 10.3791/65357

ABSTRACT:
Multiphase polymeric systems encompass local domains with dimensions that can vary from a few tens of nanometers to several micrometers. Their composition is commonly assessed using infrared spectroscopy, which provides an average fingerprint of the various materials contained in the volume probed. However, this approach does not offer any details on the arrangement of the phases in the material. Interfacial regions between two polymeric phases, often in the nanoscale range, are also challenging to access. Photothermal nanoscale infrared spectroscopy monitors the local response of materials excited by infrared light with the sensitive probe of an atomic force microscope (AFM). While the technique is suitable for interrogating small features, such as individual proteins on pristine gold surfaces, the characterization of three-dimensional multicomponent materials is more elusive. This is due to a relatively large volume of material undergoing photothermal expansion, defined by the laser focalization onto the sample and by the thermal properties of the polymeric constituents, compared to the nanoscale region probed by the AFM tip. Using a polystyrene (PS) bead and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film, we evaluate the spatial footprint of photothermal nanoscale infrared spectroscopy for surface analysis as a function of the position of PS in the PVA film. The effect of the feature position on the nanoscale infrared images is investigated, and spectra are acquired. Some perspectives on the future advances in the field of photothermal nanoscale infrared spectroscopy are provided, considering the characterization of complex systems with embedded polymeric structures.

ABSTRACT:
As an emerging imaging technology, near-infrared II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) fluorescence imaging has significant potential in the biomedical field, owing to its high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and superior imaging with spatial and temporal resolution. However, the method to facilitate the implementation of NIR-II fluorescence imaging for some urgently needed fields, such as medical science and pharmacy, has puzzled relevant researchers. This protocol describes in detail the construction and bioimaging applications of a NIR-II fluorescence molecular probe, HLY1, with a D-A-D (donor-acceptor-donor) skeleton. HLY1 showed good optical properties and biocompatibility. Furthermore, NIR-II vascular and tumor imaging in mice was performed using a NIR-II optics imaging device. Real-time high-resolution NIR-II fluorescence images were acquired to guide the detection of tumors and vascular diseases. From probe preparation to data acquisition, the imaging quality is greatly improved, and the authenticity of the NIR-II molecular probes for data recording in intravital imaging is ensured.

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondria are essential for various biological functions, including energy production, lipid metabolism, calcium homeostasis, heme biosynthesis, regulated cell death, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are vital for key biological processes. However, when uncontrolled, they can lead to oxidative injury, including mitochondrial damage. Damaged mitochondria release more ROS, thereby intensifying cellular injury and the disease state. A homeostatic process named mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) selectively removes damaged mitochondria, which are then replaced by new ones. There are multiple mitophagy pathways, with the common endpoint being the breakdown of the damaged mitochondria in lysosomes. Several methodologies, including genetic sensors, antibody immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, use this endpoint to quantify mitophagy. Each method for examining mitophagy has its advantages, such as specific tissue/cell targeting (with genetic sensors) and great detail (with electron microscopy). However, these methods often require expensive resources, trained personnel, and a lengthy preparation time before the actual experiment, such as for creating transgenic animals. Here, we present a cost-effective alternative for measuring mitophagy using commercially available fluorescent dyes targeting mitochondria and lysosomes. This method effectively measures mitophagy in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and human liver cells, which indicates its potential efficiency in other model systems.

ABSTRACT:
The satisfactory visualization of cytoskeletal components in the brain is challenging. The ubiquitous distribution of the networks of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments in all the neural tissues, together with the variability in the outcomes of fluorescent protein fusion strategies and the limited applicability to dynamic studies of antibodies and drugs as chromophore vehicles, make classical optical approaches not as effective as for other proteins. When tubulin needs to be studied, the label-free generation of second harmonics is a very suitable option due to the non-centrosymmetric organization of the molecule. This technique, when conjugated to microscopy, can qualitatively describe the volumetric distribution of parallel bundles of microtubules in biological samples, with the additional advantage of working with fresh tissues that are unfixed and unpermeabilized. This work describes how to image tubulin with a commercial second harmonic generation microscopy setup to highlight microtubules in the tubulin-enriched structures of the oligodendrocytes, as in hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) tubulinopathy, a recently described myelin disorder.

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents a new photoluminescence lifetime imager designed to map the molecular oxygen (O2) concentration in different phosphorescent samples ranging from solid-state, O2-sensitive coatings to live animal tissue samples stained with soluble O2-sensitive probes. In particular, the nanoparticle-based near-infrared probe NanO2-IR, which is excitable with a 625 nm light-emitting diode (LED) and emits at 760 nm, was used. The imaging system is based on the Timepix3 camera (Tpx3Cam) and the opto-mechanical adaptor, which also houses an image intensifier. O2 phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM) is commonly required for various studies, but current platforms have limitations in their accuracy, general flexibility, and usability. The system presented here is a fast and highly sensitive imager, which is built on an integrated optical sensor and readout chip module, Tpx3Cam. It is shown to produce high-intensity phosphorescence signals and stable lifetime values from surface-stained intestinal tissue samples or intraluminally stained fragments of the large intestine and allows the detailed mapping of tissue O2 levels in about 20 s or less. Initial experiments on the imaging of hypoxia in grafted tumors in unconscious animals are also presented. We also describe how the imager can be re-configured for use with O2-sensitive materials based on Pt-porphyrin dyes using a 390 nm LED for the excitation and a bandpass 650 nm filter for emission. Overall, the PLIM imager was found to produce accurate quantitative measurements of lifetime values for the probes used and respective two-dimensional maps of the O2 concentration. It is also useful for the metabolic imaging of ex vivo tissue models and live animals.

ABSTRACT:
Pulmonary veins (PVs) are the major source of ectopic beats in atrial arrhythmias and play a crucial role in the development and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). PVs contain myocardial sleeves (MS) composed of cardiomyocytes. MS are implicated in the initiation and maintenance of AF, as they preserve similarities to the cardiac working myocardium, including the ability to generate ectopic electrical impulses. Rodents are widely used and may represent excellent animal models to study the pulmonary vein myocardium since cardiomyocytes are widely present all over the vessel wall. However, precise microdissection and preparation of murine PVs is challenging due to the small organ size and intricate anatomy. We demonstrate a microscopy-guided microdissection protocol for isolating the murine left atrium (LA) together with the PVs. Immunofluorescence staining using cardiac Troponin-T (cTNT) and connexin 43 (Cx43) antibodies is performed to visualize the LA and PVs in full length. Imaging at 10x and 40x magnification provides a comprehensive view of the PV structure as well as detailed insights into the myocardial architecture, particularly highlighting the presence of connexin 43 within the MS.

ABSTRACT:
The potential to generate variable pore sizes, simplistic surface modification, and a breadth of commercial uses in the fields of biosensors, actuators, drug loading and release, and the development of catalysts have unquestionably accelerated the usage of nanoporous gold (NPG)-based nanomaterials in research and development. This article describes the process of the generation of hierarchical bimodal nanoporous gold (hb-NPG) by employing a step-wise procedure involving electrochemical alloying, chemical dealloying techniques, and annealing to create both macro- and mesopores. This is done to improve the utility of NPG by creating a bicontinuous solid/void morphology. The area available for surface modification is enhanced by smaller pores, while molecular transport benefits from the network of larger pores. The bimodal architecture, which is the result of a series of fabrication steps, is visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as a network of pores that are less than 100 nm in size and connected by ligaments to larger pores that are several hundred nanometers in size. The electrochemically active surface area of the hb-NPG is assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), with a focus on the critical roles that both dealloying and annealing play in creating the necessary structure. The adsorption of different proteins is measured by solution depletion technique, revealing the better performance of hb-NPG in terms of protein loading. By changing the surface area to volume ratio, the created hb-NPG electrode offers tremendous potential for biosensor development. The manuscript discusses a scalable method to create hb-NPG surface structures, as they offer a large surface area for the immobilization of small molecules and improved transport pathways for faster reactions.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2023)
PMID: 37067271
DOI: 10.3791/64713

ABSTRACT:
Relapse after cancer treatment is often attributed to the persistence of a subpopulation of tumor cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are characterized by their remarkable tumor-initiating and self-renewal capacity. Depending on the origin of the tumor (e.g., ovaries), the CSC surface biomarker profile can vary dramatically, making the identification of such cells via immunohistochemical staining a challenging endeavor. On the contrary, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) has emerged as an excellent marker to identify CSCs, owing to its conserved expression profile in nearly all progenitor cells including CSCs. The ALDH1A1 isoform belongs to a superfamily of 19 enzymes that are responsible for the oxidation of various endogenous and xenobiotic aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylic acid products. Chan et al. recently developed AlDeSense, an isoform-selective "turn-on" probe for the detection of ALDH1A1 activity, as well as a non-reactive matching control reagent (Ctrl-AlDeSense) to account for off-target staining. This isoform-selective tool has already been demonstrated to be a versatile chemical tool through the detection of ALDH1A1 activity in K562 myelogenous leukemia cells, mammospheres, and melanoma-derived CSC xenografts. In this article, the utility of the probe was showcased through additional fluorimetry, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry experiments where the relative ALDH1A1 activity was determined in a panel of five ovarian cancer cell lines.

ABSTRACT:
The mammalian brain undergoes dynamic developmental changes at both the cellular and circuit levels throughout prenatal and postnatal periods. Following the discovery of numerous genes contributing to these developmental changes, it is now known that neuronal activity also substantially modulates these processes. In the developing cerebral cortex, neurons exhibit synchronized activity patterns that are specialized to each primary sensory area. These patterns markedly differ from those observed in the mature cortex, emphasizing their role in regulating area-specific developmental processes. Deficiencies in neuronal activity during development can lead to various brain diseases. These findings highlight the need to examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying activity patterns in neuronal development. This paper summarizes a series of protocols to visualize primary sensory areas and neuronal activity in neonatal mice, to image the activity of individual neurons within the cortical subfields using two-photon microscopy in vivo, and to analyze subfield-related activity correlations. We show representative results of patchwork-like synchronous activity within individual barrels in the somatosensory cortex. We also discuss various potential applications and some limitations of this protocol.

ABSTRACT:
Forest wood borers (FWB) cause severe tree damage and economic losses worldwide. The release of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) during the FWB emergence period is considered an acceptable alternative to chemical control. However, EPF resources have been significantly less explored for FWBs, in contrast to agricultural insect pests. This paper presents a protocol for exploring EPF resources from FWBs using wild Monochamus alternatus populations as an example. In this protocol, the assignment of traps baited with M. alternatus attractants to different populations guaranteed the collection of adequate samples with natural infection symptoms, during the emergence periods of the beetle. Following finely dissecting integuments and placing them onto a selective medium, fungal species were isolated from each part of beetle bodies and identified based on both molecular and morphological traits. Several fungal species were certified as parasitic EPFs via re-infection of healthy M. alternatus with spore suspensions. Their behavioral phenotypes on M. alternatus were observed using scanning electron microscopy and further compared with those on the Coleopteran model insect Tribolium castaneum. For EPFs that present consistent parasitism phenotypes on both beetle species, evaluation of their activities on T. castaneum provided valuable information on lethality for future study on M. alternatus. This protocol helped the discovery of EPF newly reported on M. alternatus populations in China, which could be applied as an efficient approach to explore more EPF resources from other FWBs.

ABSTRACT:
Red algae (Rhodophyta) contain phycobiliproteins and colonize habitats with dim light, however some (e.g., some Chroothece species) can also develop in full sunshine. Most rhodophytes are red, however some can appear bluish, depending on the proportion of blue and red biliproteins (phycocyanin and phycoerythrin). Different phycobiliproteins can capture light at diverse wavelengths and transmit it to chlorophyll a, which makes photosynthesis under very different light conditions possible. These pigments respond to habitat changes in light, and their autofluorescence can help to study biological processes. Using Chroothece mobilis as a model organism and the spectral lambda scan mode in a confocal microscope, the adaptation of photosynthetic pigments to different monochromatic lights was studied at the cellular level to guess the species' optimal growth conditions. The results showed that, even when the studied strain was isolated from a cave, it adapted to both dim and medium light intensities. The presented method is especially useful for studying photosynthetic organisms that do not grow or grow very slowly under laboratory conditions, which is usually the case for those living in extreme habitats.

ABSTRACT:
For the past decade, three-dimensional (3D) culture models have been emerging as powerful tools in translational research to overcome the limitations of two-dimensional cell culture models. Thanks to their ability to recapitulate the phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity found in numerous organs, organoids have been used to model a broad range of tumors, such as colorectal cancer. Several approaches to generate organoids exist, with protocols using either pluripotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells, or organ-restricted adult stem cells found in primary tissues, such as surgical resections as starting material. The latter, so-called patient-derived organoids (PDOs), have shown their robustness in predicting patient drug responses compared to other models. Because of their origin, PDOs are natural offspring of the patient tumor or healthy surrounding tissue, and therefore, have been increasingly used to develop targeted drugs and personalized therapies. Here, we present a new protocol to generate patient-derived colon organoids (PDCOs) from tumor and healthy tissue biopsies. We emphasize budget-friendly and reproducible techniques, which are often limiting factors in this line of research that restrict the development of this 3D-culture model to a small number of laboratories worldwide. Accordingly, we describe efficient and cost-effective techniques to achieve immunoblot and high-resolution microscopy on PDCOs. Finally, a novel strategy of lentiviral transduction of PDCOs, which could be applied to all organoid models, is detailed in this article. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT:
Decidualization is a differentiation process involving shape reorganization from a fibroblast to an epithelioid-like appearance characteristic of endometrial stromal cells. For the study of in vitro decidualization, one needs to check that the cells have undergone this process effectively. Verification is usually done by analyzing the expression of decidual markers, but changes in morphology are a more comprehensive feature. However, morphological specificities (i.e., flatness) of endometrial cells prevent the use of existing automated tools. A simple and accurate methodology was developed to quantify the phenotypic changes that occur in an in vitro decidualization system. This approach analyzes cell circularity directly from light microscopy images to follow the effects of progesterone or progestin R5020 in combination with estradiol (E2) and cAMP in inducing the decidualization of human endometrial cells. A statistical model to detect the differences in the kinetics of decidualization of the two hormonal stimuli before all the cell population acquire the decidual phenotype was implemented. It was found that statistical differences in morphology between decidualized and control cells could be detected 2 days after the treatments. Here we detail the model applied, scripts, and input files in order to provide a useful, practical, and low-cost tool to evaluate morphological aspects of endometrial stromal differentiation. This method allows the verification of the effectiveness of the decidualization process of the stromal endometrial cells without having to use cell replicates, as other methods such as immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR assays require. Consequently, this approach can follow the kinetics of a living single replicate throughout the experiment. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Volume electron microscopy (vEM) techniques produce scientifically important datasets which are time and resource intensive to generate (Peddie et al., 2022). Public archival of such datasets, usually described in the literature, provides many benefits to the data depositors, to those making use of research results based on the datasets, and to the vEM community at large, both now and in the future. In this chapter we discuss these benefits, explain how EMBL-EBI's image data services support archival of both vEM and correlative imaging data, and discuss how future developments will unlock more value from these vEM datasets.

ABSTRACT:
Dendritic spines are key structures for neural communication, learning and memory. Spine size and shape probably reflect synaptic strength and learning. Imaging with superresolution STED microscopy the detailed shape of the majority of the spines of individual neurons in turtle cortex (Trachemys scripta elegans) revealed several distinguishable shape classes. Dendritic spines of a given class were not distributed randomly, but rather decorated significantly more often some dendrites than others. The individuality of dendrites was corroborated by significant inter-dendrite differences in other parameters such as spine density and length. In addition, many spines were branched or possessed spinules. These findings may have implications for the role of individual dendrites in this cortex.

ABSTRACT:
Edward Heron-Allen and Arthur Earland were among the last great amateur foraminifera researchers. Their partnership began in 1907 and ended in 1932. While close in age to one another, they shared little more than a fascination for forams and a lack of any university training. In most other aspects, the two men were completely different. Heron-Allen was a famous upper class polymath, expert not only on forams, but also on the Persian language, violins, palm reading, history, asparagus, and barnacles. He was also an accomplished novelist and poet, who frequented literary circles. In contrast to the flamboyant Heron-Allen, Earland was a discrete civil servant who admitted to working on forams as a relief from the monotony of his job. Hence, the two were improbable partners. However, together they produced 39 substantial works on forams. Their studies concerned assemblages from Southern Ocean to the North Sea and they are today credited with the original description of 186 species. Here the distinct lives of the two men are presented, and their contributions to protistology, as partners as well as individuals, are reviewed. The case is made for considering Earland's work as neglected relative to that of Heron-Allen, except perhaps by foram taxonomists.

TITLE: On the equivalence of binary phase masks optimized for localization or detection in extended depth-of-field localization microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Binary annular masks have recently been proposed to extend the depth of field (DoF) of single-molecule localization microscopy. A strategy for designing optimal masks has been introduced based on maximizing the emitter localization accuracy, expressed in terms of Fisher information, over a targeted DoF range. However, the complete post-processing pipeline to localize a single emitter consists of two successive steps: detection, where the regions containing emitters are determined, and localization, where the sub-pixel position of each detected emitter is estimated. Phase masks usually optimize only this second step. The presence of a phase mask also affecting detection, the purpose of this paper is to quantify and mitigate this effect. Using a rigorous framework built from a detection-oriented information theoretical criterion (Bhattacharyya distance), we demonstrate that in most cases of practical significance, annular binary phase masks maximizing Fisher information also maximize the detection probability. This result supports the common design practice consisting of optimizing a phase mask by maximizing Fisher information only.

ABSTRACT:
For decades, bacteria were thought of as "bags" of enzymes, lacking organelles and significant subcellular structures. This stood in sharp contrast with eukaryotes, where intracellular compartmentalization and the role of large-scale order had been known for a long time. However, the emerging field of Bacterial Cell Biology has established that bacteria are in fact highly organized, with most macromolecular components having specific subcellular locations that can change depending on the cell's physiological state (Barry & Gitai, 2011; Lenz & Søgaard-Andersen, 2011; Thanbichler & Shapiro, 2008). For example, we now know that many processes in bacteria are orchestrated by cytoskeletal proteins, which polymerize into surprisingly diverse superstructures, such as rings, sheets, and tread-milling rods (Pilhofer & Jensen, 2013). These superstructures connect individual proteins, macromolecular assemblies, and even two neighboring cells, to affect essential higher-order processes including cell division, DNA segregation, and motility. Understanding these processes requires resolving the in vivo dynamics and ultrastructure at different functional stages of the cell, at macromolecular resolution and in 3-dimensions (3D). Fluorescence light microscopy (fLM) of tagged proteins is highly valuable for investigating protein localization and dynamics, and the resolution power of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is required to elucidate the structure of macromolecular complexes in vivo and in vitro. This chapter summarizes the most recent advances in LM and TEM approaches that have revolutionized our knowledge and understanding of the microbial world.

ABSTRACT:
Akanes are fluorescent proteins that have several fluorescence maxima. In this report, Akane1 and Akane3 from Scleronephthya gracillima were selected, successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Fluorescence spectra of the recombinant Akanes matured in darkness, or ambient light were found to have several fluorescence peaks. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that Akanes matured in ambient light have two fragments. MS/MS analysis of Akanes digested with trypsin showed that the cleavage site is the same as observed for the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede. The differences between the calculated masses from the amino acid sequence of Akane1 and the measured masses of Akane1 fragments obtained under ambient light coincided with those of Kaede. In contrast, a mass difference between the measured N-terminal Akane3 fragment and the calculated mass indicated that Akane3 is modified in the N-terminal region. These results indicate that numerous peaks in the fluorescent spectra of Akanes partly arise from isoproteins of Akanes and photoconversion. Photoconversion of Akane1 caused a fluorescence change from green to red, which was also observed for Akane3; however, the fluorescent intensity decreased dramatically when compared with that of Akane3.

ABSTRACT:
The choroid plexus (CP), a highly vascularized structure protruding into the ventricles of the brain, is one of the most understudied tissues in neuroscience. As it is becoming increasingly clear that this tiny structure plays a crucial role in health and disease of the central nervous system (CNS), it is of utmost importance to properly dissect the CP out of the brain ventricles in a way that allows downstream processing, ranging from functional to structural analysis. Here, isolation of the lateral and fourth brain ventricle mouse CP without the need for specialized tools or equipment is described. This isolation technique preserves the viability, function, and structure of cells within the CP. On account of its high vascularization, the CP can be visualized floating inside the ventricular cavities of the brain using a binocular microscope. However, transcardial perfusion required for downstream analysis can complicate the identification of the CP tissue. Depending on the further processing steps (e.g., RNA and protein analysis), this can be solved by visualizing the CP via transcardial perfusion with bromophenol blue. After isolation, the CP can be processed using several techniques, including RNA, protein, or single cell analysis, to gain further understanding on the function of this special brain structure. Here, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on whole mount CP is used to get an overall view of the structure.

ABSTRACT:
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-limited structures released from the cells into the extracellular space and are implicated in intercellular communication. EVs consist of three populations of vesicles, namely microvesicles (MVs), exosomes, and apoptotic bodies. The limiting membrane of EVs is crucially involved in the interactions with the recipient cells, which could lead to the transfer of biologically active molecules to the recipient cells and, consequently, affect their behavior. The freeze-fracture electron microscopy technique is used to study the internal organization of biological membranes. Here, we present a protocol for MV isolation from cultured cancerous urothelial cells and the freeze-fracture of MVs in the steps of rapid freezing, fracturing, making and cleaning the replicas, and analyzing them with transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the protocol for isolation yields a homogenous population of EVs, which correspond to the shape and size of MVs. Intramembrane particles are found mainly in the protoplasmic face of the limiting membrane. Hence, freeze-fracture is the technique of choice to characterize the MVs' diameter, shape, and distribution of membrane proteins. The presented protocol is applicable to other populations of EVs.

TITLE: Confocal Microscopy to Measure Three Modes of Fusion Pore Dynamics in Adrenal Chromaffin Cells.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2022)
PMID: 35377362
DOI: 10.3791/63569

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic fusion pore opening and closure mediate exocytosis and endocytosis and determine their kinetics. Here, it is demonstrated in detail how confocal microscopy was used in combination with patch-clamp recording to detect three fusion modes in primary culture bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. The three fusion modes include 1) close-fusion (also called kiss-and-run), involving fusion pore opening and closure, 2) stay-fusion, involving fusion pore opening and maintaining the opened pore, and 3) shrink-fusion, involving shrinkage of the fusion-generated Ω-shape profile until it merges completely at the plasma membrane. To detect these fusion modes, the plasma membrane was labeled by overexpressing mNeonGreen attached with the PH domain of phospholipase C δ (PH-mNG), which binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) at the cytosol-facing leaflet of the plasma membrane; vesicles were loaded with the fluorescent false neurotransmitter FFN511 to detect vesicular content release; and Atto 655 was included in the bath solution to detect fusion pore closure. These three fluorescent probes were imaged simultaneously at ~20-90 ms per frame in live chromaffin cells to detect fusion pore opening, content release, fusion pore closure, and fusing vesicle size changes. The analysis method is described to distinguish three fusion modes from these fluorescence measurements. The method described here can, in principle, apply to many secretory cells beyond chromaffin cells.

ABSTRACT:
Starch granules (SGs) exhibit different morphologies depending on the plant species, especially in the endosperm of the Poaceae family. Endosperm phenotyping can be used to classify genotypes based on SG morphotype using scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. SGs can be visualized using SEM by slicing through the kernel (pericarp, aleurone layers, and endosperm) and exposing the organellar contents. Current methods require the rice kernel to be embedded in plastic resin and sectioned using a microtome or embedded in a truncated pipette tip and sectioned by hand using a razor blade. The former method requires specialized equipment and is time-consuming, while the latter introduces a new host of problems depending on rice genotype. Chalky rice varieties, particularly, pose a problem for this type of sectioning due to the friable nature of their endosperm tissue. Presented here is a technique for preparing translucent and chalky rice kernel sections for microscopy, requiring only pipette tips and a scalpel blade. Preparing the sections within the confines of a pipette tip prevents rice kernel endosperm from shattering (for translucent or 'vitreous' phenotypes) and crumbling (for chalky phenotypes). Using this technique, endosperm cell patterning and the structure of intact SGs can be observed.

ABSTRACT:
A method is described here to characterize the physical properties of the cell wall of epidermal cells of living Arabidopsis roots through nanoindentations with an atomic force microscope (AFM) coupled with an optical inverted fluorescence microscope. The method consists of applying controlled forces to the sample while measuring its deformation, allowing quantifying parameters such as the apparent Young's modulus of cell walls at subcellular resolutions. It requires a careful mechanical immobilization of the sample and correct selection of indenters and indentation depths. Although it can be used only in external tissues, this method allows characterizing mechanical changes in plant cell walls during development and enables the correlation of these microscopic changes with the growth of an entire organ.

ABSTRACT:
DNA repair in the context of chromatin is poorly understood. Biochemical studies using nucleosome core particles, the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, show most DNA repair enzymes remove DNA damage at reduced rates as compared to free DNA. The molecular details on how base excision repair (BER) enzymes recognize and remove DNA damage in nucleosomes have not been elucidated. However, biochemical BER data of nucleosomal substrates suggest the nucleosome presents different structural barriers dependent on the location of the DNA lesion and the enzyme. This indicates the mechanisms employed by these enzymes to remove DNA damage in free DNA may be different than those employed in nucleosomes. Given that the majority of genomic DNA is assembled into nucleosomes, structural information of these complexes is needed. To date, the scientific community lacks detailed protocols to perform technically feasible structural studies of these complexes. Here, we provide two methods to prepare a complex of two genetically fused BER enzymes (Polymerase β and AP Endonuclease1) bound to a single-nucleotide gap near the entry-exit of the nucleosome for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural determination. Both methods of sample preparation are compatible for vitrifying quality grids via plunge freezing. This protocol can be used as a starting point to prepare other nucleosomal complexes with different BER factors, pioneer transcription factors, and chromatin-modifying enzymes.

TITLE: Visualization of Inflammatory Caspases Induced Proximity in Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages.
AUTHORS: Bolívar Beatriz E, Bouchier-Hayes Lisa
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2022)
PMID: 35467667
DOI: 10.3791/63162

ABSTRACT:
Inflammatory caspases include caspase-1, -4, -5, -11, and -12 and belong to the subgroup of initiator caspases. Caspase-1 is required to ensure correct regulation of inflammatory signaling and is activated by proximity-induced dimerization following recruitment to inflammasomes. Caspase-1 is abundant in the monocytic cell lineage and induces maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 to active secreted molecules. The other inflammatory caspases, caspase-4 and -5 (and their murine homolog caspase-11) promote IL-1β release by inducing pyroptosis. Caspase Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) is a tool used to measure inflammatory caspase induced proximity as a readout of caspase activation. The caspase-1, -4, or -5 prodomain, which contains the region that binds to the inflammasome, is fused to non-fluorescent fragments of the yellow fluorescent protein Venus (Venus-N [VN] or Venus-C [VC]) that associate to reform the fluorescent Venus complex when the caspases undergo induced proximity. This protocol describes how to introduce these reporters into primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) using nucleofection, treat the cells to induce inflammatory caspase activation, and measure caspase activation using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The advantage of this approach is that it can be used to identify the components, requirements, and localization of the inflammatory caspase activation complex in living cells. However, careful controls need to be considered to avoid compromising cell viability and behavior. This technique is a powerful tool for the analysis of dynamic caspase interactions at the inflammasome level as well as for the interrogation of the inflammatory signaling cascades in living MDM and monocytes derived from human blood samples.

ABSTRACT:
Cellular mechanical properties are involved in a wide variety of biological processes and diseases, ranging from stem cell differentiation to cancer metastasis. Conventional methods for measuring these properties, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micropipette aspiration (MA), capture rich information, reflecting a cell's full viscoelastic response; however, these methods are limited by very low throughput. High-throughput approaches, such as real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC), can only measure limited mechanical information, as they are often restricted to single-parameter readouts that only reflect a cell's elastic properties. In contrast to these methods, mechano-node-pore sensing (mechano-NPS) is a flexible, label-free microfluidic platform that bridges the gap in achieving multi-parameter viscoelastic measurements of a cell with moderate throughput. A direct current (DC) measurement is used to monitor cells as they transit a microfluidic channel, tracking their size and velocity before, during, and after they are forced through a narrow constriction. This information (i.e., size and velocity) is used to quantify each cell's transverse deformation, resistance to deformation, and recovery from deformation. In general, this electronics-based microfluidic platform provides multiple viscoelastic cell properties, and thus a more complete picture of a cell's mechanical state. Because it requires minimal sample preparation, utilizes a straightforward electronic measurement (in contrast to a high-speed camera), and takes advantage of standard soft lithography fabrication, the implementation of this platform is simple, accessible, and adaptable to downstream analysis. This platform's flexibility, utility, and sensitivity have provided unique mechanical information on a diverse range of cells, with the potential for many more applications in basic science and clinical diagnostics.

ABSTRACT:
A major limitation for the efficient and high-throughput structure analysis of biomolecules using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is the difficulty of preparing cryo-EM samples with controlled ice thickness at the nanoscale. The silicon (Si)-based chip, which has a regular array of micro-holes with graphene oxide (GO) window patterned on a thickness-controlled silicon nitride (SixNy) film, has been developed by applying microelectromechanical system (MEMS) techniques. UV photolithography, chemical vapor deposition, wet and dry etching of the thin film, and drop-casting of 2D nanosheet materials were used for mass-production of the micro-patterned chips with GO windows. The depth of the micro-holes is regulated to control the ice thickness on-demand, depending on the size of the specimen for cryo-EM analysis. The favorable affinity of GO toward biomolecules concentrates the biomolecules of interest within the micro-hole during cryo-EM sample preparation. The micro-patterned chip with GO windows enables high-throughput cryo-EM imaging of various biological molecules, as well as inorganic nanomaterials.

ABSTRACT:
Understanding the mechanisms that underpin post-natal maturation of articular cartilage is of crucial importance for designing the next generation of tissue engineering strategies and potentially repairing diseased or damaged cartilage. In general, postnatal maturation of the articular cartilage, which is a wholesale change in collagen structure and function of the tissue to accommodate growth of the organism, occurs over a timescale ranging from months to years. Conversely dissolution of the structural organization of the cartilage that also occurs over long timescales is the hallmark of tissue degeneration. Our ability to study these biological processes in detail have been enhanced by the findings that growth factors can induce precocious in vitro maturation of immature articular cartilage. The developmental and disease related changes that occur in the joint involve bone and cartilage and an ability to co-image these tissues would significantly increase our understanding of their intertwined roles. The simultaneous visualization of soft tissue, cartilage and bone changes is nowadays a challenge to overcome for conventional preclinical imaging modalities used for the joint disease follow-up. Three-dimensional X-ray Phase-Contrast Imaging methods (PCI) have been under perpetual developments for 20 years due to high performance for imaging low density objects and their ability to provide additional information compared to conventional X-ray imaging. In this protocol we detail the procedure used in our experiments from biopsy of the cartilage, generation of in vitro matured cartilage to data analysis of image collected using X-ray phase contrast imaging.

ABSTRACT:
Principles of DNA folding in the cell nucleus and its dynamic transformations that occur during the fulfillment of basic genetic functions (transcription, replication, segregation, etc.) remain poorly understood, partially due to the lack of experimental approaches to high-resolution visualization of specific chromatin loci in structurally preserved nuclei. Here we present a protocol for the visualization of replicative domains in monolayer cell culture in situ, by combining EdU labeling of newly synthesized DNA with subsequent label detection with Ag-amplification of Nanogold particles and ChromEM staining of chromatin. This protocol allows for the high-contrast, high-efficiency pre-embedding labeling, compatible with traditional glutaraldehyde fixation that provides the best structural preservation of chromatin for room-temperature sample processing. Another advantage of pre-embedding labeling is the possibility to pre-select cells of interest for sectioning. This is especially important for the analysis of heterogeneous cell populations, as well as compatibility with electron tomography approaches to high-resolution 3D analysis of chromatin organization at sites of replication, and the analysis of post-replicative chromatin rearrangement and sister chromatid segregation in the interphase.

TITLE: A Microfluidic Approach for the Study of Ice and Clathrate Hydrate Crystallization.
AUTHORS: Drori Ran, Shalom Yitzhar
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2022)
PMID: 36063015
DOI: 10.3791/64072

ABSTRACT:
An accurate mechanistic description of water crystallization is challenging and requires a few key elements: superb temperature control to allow the formation of single microscopic crystals and a suitable microscopy system coupled to the cold stage. The method described herein adds another important feature that includes exchanging solutions around ice and clathrate hydrate crystals. The described system comprises a combination of unique and home-developed instruments, including microfluidics, high-resolution cold stages, and fluorescence microscopy. The cold stage was designed for microfluidic devices and allows for the formation of micron-sized ice/hydrate crystals inside microfluidic channels and the exchange of solutions around them. The temperature resolution and stability of the cold stage is one millikelvin, which is crucial for controlling the growth of these small crystals. This diverse system is used to study the different processes of ice and hydrate crystallization and the mechanism by which the growth of these crystals is inhibited. The protocol describes how to prepare microfluidic devices, how to grow and control microscopic crystals in the microfluidic channels, and how the utilization of the flow of liquids around ice/hydrate crystals affords new insights into the crystallization of water.

TITLE: Digital Spatial Profiling for Characterization of the Microenvironment in Adult-Type Diffusely Infiltrating Glioma.

ABSTRACT:
Diffusely infiltrating gliomas are associated with high morbidity and mortality due to the infiltrative nature of tumor spread. They are morphologically complex tumors, with a high degree of proteomic variability across both the tumor itself and its heterogenous microenvironment. The malignant potential of these tumors is enhanced by the dysregulation of proteins involved in several key pathways, including processes that maintain cellular stability and preserve the structural integrity of the microenvironment. Although there have been numerous bulk and single-cell glioma analyses, there is a relative paucity of spatial stratification of these proteomic data. Understanding differences in spatial distribution of tumorigenic factors and immune cell populations between the intrinsic tumor, invasive edge, and microenvironment offers valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying tumor proliferation and propagation. Digital spatial profiling (DSP) represents a powerful technology that can form the foundation for these important multilayer analyses. DSP is a method that efficiently quantifies protein expression within user-specified spatial regions in a tissue specimen. DSP is ideal for studying the differential expression of multiple proteins within and across regions of distinction, enabling multiple levels of quantitative and qualitative analysis. The DSP protocol is systematic and user-friendly, allowing for customized spatial analysis of proteomic data. In this experiment, tissue microarrays are constructed from archived glioblastoma core biopsies. Next, a panel of antibodies is selected, targeting proteins of interest within the sample. The antibodies, which are preconjugated to UV-photocleavable DNA oligonucleotides, are then incubated with the tissue sample overnight. Under fluorescence microscopy visualization of the antibodies, regions of interest (ROIs) within which to quantify protein expression are defined with the samples. UV light is then directed at each ROI, cleaving the DNA oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides are microaspirated and counted within each ROI, quantifying the corresponding protein on a spatial basis.

PMID: 35781468
DOI: 10.3791/63196

ABSTRACT:
The body axis of vertebrate embryos is periodically subdivided into 3D multicellular units called somites. While genetic oscillations and molecular prepatterns determine the initial length-scale of somites, mechanical processes have been implicated in setting their final size and shape. To better understand the intrinsic material properties of somites, a method is developed to culture single-somite explant from zebrafish embryos. Single somites are isolated by first removing the skin of embryos, followed by yolk removal and sequential excision of neighboring tissues. Using transgenic embryos, the distribution of various sub-cellular structures can be observed by fluorescent time-lapse microscopy. Dynamics of explanted somites can be followed for several hours, thus providing an experimental framework for studying tissue-scale shape changes at single-cell resolution. This approach enables direct mechanical manipulation of somites, allowing for dissection of the material properties of the tissue. Finally, the technique outlined here can be readily extended for explanting other tissues such as the notochord, neural plate, and lateral plate mesoderm.

PMID: 35815976

ABSTRACT:
There is a need to understand materials exposed to overlapping extreme environments such as high temperature, radiation, or mechanical stress. When these stressors are combined there may be synergistic effects that enable unique microstructural evolution mechanisms to activate. Understanding of these mechanisms is necessary for the input and refinement of predictive models and critical for engineering of next generation materials. The basic physics and underlying mechanisms require advanced tools to be investigated. The in situ ion irradiation transmission electron microscope (I³TEM) is designed to explore these principles. To quantitatively probe the complex dynamic interactions in materials, careful preparation of samples and consideration of experimental design is required. Particular handling or preparation of samples can easily introduce damage or features that obfuscate the measurements. There is no one correct way to prepare a sample; however, many mistakes can be made. The most common errors and things to consider are highlighted within. The I³TEM has many adjustable variables and a large potential experimental space, therefore it is best to design experiments with a specific scientific question or questions in mind. Experiments have been performed on large number of sample geometries, material classes, and with many irradiation conditions. The following are a subset of examples that demonstrate unique in situ capabilities utilizing the I3TEM. Au nanoparticles prepared by drop casting have been used to investigate the effects of single ion strikes. Au thin films have been used in studies on the effects of multibeam irradiation on microstructure evolution. Zr films have been exposed to irradiation and mechanical tension to examine creep. Ag nanopillars were subjected to simultaneous high temperature, mechanical compression, and ion irradiation to study irradiation induced creep as well. These results impact fields including: structural materials, nuclear energy, energy storage, catalysis, and microelectronics in space environments.

ABSTRACT:
MOTIVATION: Live-cell microscopy has become an essential tool for analyzing dynamic processes in various biological applications. Thereby, high-throughput and automated tracking analyses allow the simultaneous evaluation of large numbers of objects. However, to critically assess the influence of individual objects on calculated summary statistics, and to detect heterogeneous dynamics or possible artifacts, such as misclassified or -tracked objects, a direct mapping of gained statistical information onto the actual image data would be necessary. RESULTS: We present VisuStatR as a platform independent software package that allows the direct visualization of time-resolved summary statistics of morphological characteristics or motility dynamics onto raw images. The software contains several display modes to compare user-defined summary statistics and the underlying image data in various levels of detail. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: VisuStatR is a free and open-source R-package, containing a user-friendly graphical-user interface and is available via GitHub at https://github.com/grrchrr/VisuStatR/ under the MIT+ license. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TITLE: Structured illumination-based transport-of-intensity phase imaging for quantitative diagnostics of high-speed flows.
AUTHORS: Medhi Biswajit
JOURNAL: Applied optics (2022)
PMID: 35201064
DOI: 10.1364/AO.440213

ABSTRACT:
A method for quantitative estimation of density in a high-speed flow field is presented, which uses structured illumination to interrogate the region of interest (ROI). Wavefront distortion suffered by the interrogating beam as it passes through the shock-induced flow field is investigated. Customized camera optics is used to measure the cross-sectional intensities of the exiting wavefront at two different planes, concurrently. A technique is proposed that uses the displacement of the structured light pattern to estimate the axial intensity derivative, ∂I∂z, which is the input to the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) for phase estimation. The proposed method allows the use of images with larger defocused distances, ∂z, as it does not follow the conventional recipe of finite-difference (FD) approximation for intensity derivative estimation. This flexes two requirements of conventional TIE imaging: first, it brings flexibility in imaging optics, not restricted to small f-number objectives; second, use of a sensitive camera is optional, as ∂I∂z estimation does not use absolute intensities but information from the distorted pattern of structured light. The recovered phase from the TIE is used as an input to the phase tomography algorithm to obtain the refractive index followed by density distributions in the flow field quantitatively. The proposed phase estimation technique is verified through simulations first and then is implemented in experiments conducted in a hypersonic shock tunnel for flow Mach No. of 8.8. Estimated cross-sectional densities of the flow field around the aerodynamic test model are presented and compared with the numerically estimated values, which shows good agreement.

ABSTRACT:
New insight into the architecture of chromosomes, their molecular composition, structure and spatial location, and time-resolved features, has grown enormously through developments of a range of pioneering interdisciplinary approaches that lie at the interface of the life and physical sciences. These involve several state-of-the-art "physics of life" tools that are both experimental and theoretical, used in conjunction with molecular biology methods which enable investigation of chromosome structure and function in vitro, in vivo, and even in silico. In particular, a move towards far greater quantitation has enabled transformative leaps in our understanding. These have involved valuable improvements to the spatial and temporal resolution of quantitative measurements, such as in vivo super-resolved light microscopy and single-molecule biophysics methods, which facilitate probing of dynamic chromosome processes hitherto impossible. Similarly, there have been important advances in the theoretical biophysics approaches which have enabled advances in predictive modeling to generate new understanding of the modes of operation of chromosomes across all domains of life. Here, I discuss these advances, and review the current state of our knowledge of chromosome architecture and speculation where future advances may lead.

DOI: 10.1016/bs.ctm.2022.09.006

ABSTRACT:
Cardiovascular disease is on the rise, partially due to the continued increase in metabolic syndrome. Advances in basic research on vascular ion transport have the potential to provide targets for therapeutic interventions. Vascular specificity, which includes different vascular beds having different characteristics and the macro- vs. microvasculature, is a vitally important variable in characterization of ion transport. At the cellular level, targeted fluorescent biosensors for Ca2+, super-resolution microscopy, and organelle patch clamp electrophysiology enable more detailed studies. The "MetS/diabetes milieu" includes increased and decreased insulin, and increased glucose, increased LDL/HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased blood pressure. The duration and severity of MetS/diabetes components certainly affect the vascular phenotype and ion transport and membrane interactions. A combination of in vivo animal models and in vitro cell models to study ion transport in MetS/diabetes conditions is optimal. Gene editing and selective pharmacological tools should be used after or in conjunction with characterization of ion transport in vascular health and disease phenotypes. This is critical to determining the causal role of Ca2+ signaling in modulation of vascular phenotype. The ion transport and membrane interactions that are measured are typically only a snapshot in time in these dynamic processes occurring over the progression of health and disease. It is imperative that this concept be considered in the planning of long-term studies of vascular disease, ion transport experiments, and interpretation of the data. Future directions for our contributors' research will advance the field.

PMID: 34180891

ABSTRACT:
Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) has become an integral part of many drug-discovery projects because crystallography of the protein target is not always achievable and cryoEM provides an alternative means to support structure-based ligand design. When dealing with a large number of distinct projects, and within each project a potentially large number of ligand-protein co-structures, accurate record keeping rapidly becomes challenging. Many experimental parameters are tuned for each target, including at the sample preparation, grid preparation, and microscopy stages. Therefore, accurate record keeping can be crucially important to enable long-term reproducibility, and to facilitate efficient teamwork, especially when steps of the cryoEM workflow are performed by different operators. To help deal with this challenge, we developed a web-based information management system for cryoEM, called gP2S. The application keeps track of each experiment, from sample to final atomic model, in the context of projects, a list of which is maintained in the application, or externally in a separate system. User-defined controlled vocabularies of consumables, equipment, protocols and software help describe each step of the cryoEM workflow in a structured manner. gP2S is widely configurable and, depending on the team's needs, may exist as a standalone product or be a part of a broader ecosystem of scientific applications, integrating via REST APIs with project management tools, applications tracking the production of proteins or of small molecules ligands, or applications automating data collection and storage. Users can register details of each grid and microscopy session including key experimental metadata and parameter values, and the lineage of each experimental artifact (sample, grid, microscopy session, map, etc.) is recorded. gP2S serves as a cryoEM experimental workflow organizer that enables accurate record keeping for teams, and is available under an open-source license.

ABSTRACT:
Observing the intravascular dynamics of mouse liver tissue allows us to conduct further in-depth observations and studies on tissue-related diseases of the mouse liver. A mouse is injected with a dye that can stain blood vessels. To observe the mouse liver in vivo, it is exposed and fixed in a frame. Two and three-dimensional images of the blood vessels in the liver tissue are obtained using a multiphoton microscope. Images of the tissues at the selected sites are continuously acquired to observe long-term changes; the dynamic changes of blood vessels in the liver tissues are also observed. Multiphoton microscopy is a method for observing cell and cell function in deep tissue sections or organs. Multiphoton microscopy has sensitivity to tissue microstructure and enables imaging of biological tissues at high spatial resolution in vivo, providing the ability to capture the biochemical information of the organization. Multiphoton microscopy is used to observe part of the liver but fixing the liver to make the image more stable is problematic. In this experiment, a special vacuum suction cup is used to fix the liver and obtain a more stable image of the liver under the microscope. In addition, this method can be used to observe dynamic changes of specific substances in the liver by marking such substances with dyes.

ABSTRACT:
Accessibility to germ cells allows the study of germ cell development, meiosis, and recombination. The sexual biotype of the freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, is a powerful invertebrate model to study the epigenetic specification of germ cells. Unlike the large number of testis and male germ cells, planarian oocytes are relatively difficult to locate and examine, as there are only two ovaries, each with 5-20 oocytes. Deeper localization within the planarian body and lack of protective epithelial tissues also make it challenging to dissect planarian ovaries directly. This protocol uses a brief fixation step to facilitate the localization and dissection of planarian ovaries for downstream analysis to overcome these difficulties. The dissected ovary is compatible for ultrastructural examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and antibody immunostaining. The dissection technique outlined in this protocol also allows for gene perturbation experiments, in which the ovaries are examined under different RNA interference (RNAi) conditions. Direct access to the intact germ cells in the ovary achieved by this protocol will greatly improve the imaging depth and quality and allow cellular and subcellular interrogation of oocyte biology.

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondrial redox homeostasis is important for neuronal viability and function. Although mitochondria contain several redox systems, the highly abundant thiol-disulfide redox buffer glutathione is considered a central player in antioxidant defenses. Therefore, measuring the mitochondrial glutathione redox potential provides useful information about mitochondrial redox status and oxidative stress. Glutaredoxin1-roGFP2 (Grx1-roGFP2) is a genetically encoded, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based ratiometric indicator of the glutathione redox potential that has two redox-state-sensitive excitation peaks at 400 nm and 490 nm with a single emission peak at 510 nm. This article describes how to perform confocal live microscopy of mitochondria-targeted Grx1-roGFP2 in primary hippocampal and cortical neurons. It describes how to assess steady-state mitochondrial glutathione redox potential (e.g., to compare disease states or long-term treatments) and how to measure redox changes upon acute treatments (using the excitotoxic drug N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) as an example). In addition, the article presents co-imaging of Grx1-roGFP2 and the mitochondrial membrane potential indicator, tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE), to demonstrate how Grx1-roGPF2 can be multiplexed with additional indicators for multiparametric analyses. This protocol provides a detailed description of how to (i) optimize confocal laser scanning microscope settings, (ii) apply drugs for stimulation followed by sensor calibration with diamide and dithiothreitol, and (iii) analyze data with ImageJ/FIJI.

ABSTRACT:
Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ)/Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling is tightly regulated and balanced during the development and homeostasis of the vasculature system Therefore, deregulation in this signaling pathway results in severe vascular pathologies, such as pulmonary artery hypertension, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells (ECs), as the innermost layer of blood vessels, are constantly exposed to fluid shear stress (SS). Abnormal patterns of fluid SS have been shown to enhance TGFβ/BMP signaling, which, together with other stimuli, induce atherogenesis. In relation to this, atheroprone, low laminar SS was found to enhance TGFβ/BMP signaling while atheroprotective, high laminar SS, diminishes this signaling. To efficiently analyze the activation of these pathways, we designed a workflow to investigate the formation of transcription factor complexes under low laminar SS and high laminar SS conditions using a commercially available pneumatic pump system and proximity ligation assay (PLA). Active TGFβ/BMP-signaling requires the formation of trimeric SMAD complexes consisting of two regulatory SMADs (R-SMAD); SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 for TGFβ and BMP signaling, respectively) with a common mediator SMAD (co-SMAD; SMAD4). Using PLA targeting different subunits of the trimeric SMAD-complex, i.e., either R-SMAD/co-SMAD or R-SMAD/R-SMAD, the formation of active SMAD transcription factor complexes can be measured quantitatively and spatially using fluorescence microscopy. The usage of flow slides with 6 small parallel channels, that can be connected in series, allows for the investigation of the transcription factor complex formation and inclusion of necessary controls. The workflow explained here can be easily adapted for studies targeting the proximity of SMADs to other transcription factors or to transcription factor complexes other than SMADs, in different fluid SS conditions. The workflow presented here shows a quick and effective way to study the fluid SS induced TGFβ/BMP signaling in ECs, both quantitatively and spatially.

ABSTRACT:
Urinary incontinence (UI) is a highly prevalent condition characterized by the deficiency of the urethral sphincter muscle. Regenerative medicine branches, particularly cell therapy, are novel approaches to improve and restore the urethral sphincter function. Even though injection of active functional cells is routinely performed in clinical settings by needle and syringe, these approaches have significant disadvantages and limitations. In this context, needle-free waterjet (WJ) technology is a feasible and innovative method that can inject viable cells by visual guided cystoscopy in the urethral sphincter. In the present study, we used WJ to deliver porcine adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (pADSCs) into cadaveric urethral tissue and subsequently investigated the effect of WJ delivery on cell yield and viability. We also assessed the biomechanical features (i.e., elasticity) by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. We showed that WJ delivered pADSCs were significantly reduced in their cellular elasticity. The viability was significantly lower compared to controls but is still above 80%.

ABSTRACT:
Light-weight, protective armor systems typically consist of high modulus (>109 MPa) and high-strength polymeric fibers held in place with an elastic resin material (binder) to form a non-woven, unidirectional laminate. While significant efforts have focused on improving the mechanical properties of the high-strength fibers, little work has been undertaken to improve the properties of the binder materials. To improve the performance of these elastomeric polymer binders, a relatively new and simple fabrication process, known as solution blow spinning, was used. This technique is capable of producing sheets or webs of fibers with average diameters ranging from the nanoscale to the microscale. To achieve this, a solution blow spinning (SBS) apparatus has been designed and built in the laboratory to fabricate non-woven fiber mats from polymer elastomer solutions. In this study, a commonly used binder material, a styrene-butadiene-styrene block-co-polymer dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, was used to produce nanocomposite fiber mats by adding metallic nanoparticles (NPs), such as iron oxide NPs, that were encapsulated with silicon oil and thus incorporated in the fibers formed via the SBS process. The protocol described in this work will discuss the effects of the various critical parameters involved in the SBS process, including the polymer molar mass, the selection of the thermodynamically appropriate solvent, the polymer concentration in solution, and the carrier gas pressure to assist others in performing similar experiments, as well as provide guidance to optimize the configuration of the experimental setup. The structural integrity and morphology of the resultant non-woven fiber mats were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental X-ray analysis via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of the various experimental parameters and material selections to optimize the structure and morphology of the SBS fiber mats.

TITLE: Electrochemical Preparation of Poly(3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene) Layers on Gold Microelectrodes for Uric Acid-Sensing Applications.

ABSTRACT:
Two different methods for the synthesis of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) on gold electrodes are described, using electropolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer in an aqueous and an organic solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used in the synthesis of PEDOT thin layers. Lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) was used as a dopant in both aqueous (aqueous/acetonitrile (ACN)) and organic (propylene carbonate (PC)) solvent systems. After the PEDOT layer was created in the organic system, the electrode surface was acclimatized by successive cycling in an aqueous solution for use as a sensor for aqueous samples. The use of an aqueous-based electropolymerization method has the potential benefit of removing the acclimatization step to have a shorter sensor preparation time. Although the aqueous method is more economical and environmentally friendly than the organic solvent method, superior PEDOT formation is obtained in the organic solution. The resulting PEDOT electrode surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which showed the constant growth of PEDOT during electropolymerization from the organic PC solution, with rapid fractal-type growth on gold (Au) microelectrodes.

ABSTRACT:
Acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses (AUFIs) are associated with specific characterizations like fever of less than two weeks' duration with no organ-specific symptoms at onset. These range from mild and self-limiting disease to progressive, life-threatening illness. Acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses are classified into malaria and non-malarial illnesses on the basis of microscopy or malariadiagnostic tests. Various challenges, such as comorbidities, geriatrics, pregnancy, and immune-compromised profile of the patient, impede the treatment regimen. Identifying the root cause of undifferentiated fever becomes critical and involves correct diagnostic tests along with empirical treatment initiation. Doxycycline, being a broad-spectrum antibiotic, confers activity against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and "atypical" bacteria. Apart from antimicrobial activity, Doxycycline demonstrates the potential to inhibit dengue virus replication and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by down-regulating proinflammatory cytokine levels. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads, the clinical management of associated cytokine storm remains unanswered. Considering the probable beneficial effect of doxycycline, it has been recommended by the national and international experts for the empirical management of COVID-19.

ABSTRACT:
We propose double structured illumination microscopy (SIM) method, which enables simultaneous imaging of achiral and chiral domains at sub-wavelength resolution. In double SIM, the illumination field is spatially structured both in the intensity and optical chirality so that moiré effects can be concurrently generated on the achiral and chiral fluorescent domains of a sample. This allows for down-modulating the high spatial frequency of both domains at the same time and thus provides sub-wavelength details after image reconstruction. We introduce the working principle of double SIM and theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of this method using different kinds of synthetic samples.

DOI: 10.1364/AO.428871

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic coded x-ray tomosynthesis (CXT) uses a set of encoded x-ray sources to interrogate objects lying on a moving conveyor mechanism. The object is reconstructed from the encoded measurements received by the uniform linear array detectors. We propose a multi-objective optimization (MO) method for structured illuminations to balance the reconstruction quality and radiation dose in a dynamic CXT system. The MO framework is established based on a dynamic sensing geometry with binary coding masks. The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 is used to solve the MO problem by jointly optimizing the coding masks, locations of x-ray sources, and exposure moments. Computational experiments are implemented to assess the proposed MO method. They show that the proposed strategy can obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions with different levels of radiation dose and better reconstruction quality than the initial setting.

ABSTRACT:
Selective elimination of damaged mitochondria via macroautophagy (mitophagy) is a conserved cellular process that plays an important role in organismal health. In recent years mitophagy has been studied in parallel to the more general, non-selective autophagy pathway induced in response to amino acid starvation with important similarities and differences noted between the two. The elaborate sequence of membrane rearrangements that give rise to autophagosomes in the non-selective pathway have their counterpart in mitophagy, but with the addition of other factors, such as a ubiquitin mark and mitophagy receptors, which mediate cargo recognition. In some types of mitophagy such as the one induced by ivermectin, the forming autophagosomal structure contains six different elements: the targeted mitochondrial fragment, a section of endoplasmic reticulum that provides a cradle, a ubiquitin layer, the mitophagy receptors and the early and late autophagosomal proteins/membranes. Super-resolution microscopy is ideally suited to investigate the spatial relationships between these elements that converge together but retain some distinctive localization, and we provide here a general protocol that can be used for mammalian cells.

ABSTRACT:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful, broadly used microscopy-based technique that leverages fluorescently labeled nucleic acid probes to detect parts of the genome inside metaphase or interphase cell nuclei. In recent years, different methodologies developed to visualize genome topology and spatial relationships between genes have gained much attention as instruments to decode the relationship between chromatin structure and function. In addition to chromosome conformation capture-based techniques, highly multiplexed forms of FISH combined with high-throughput and super-resolution microscopy are used to map and spatially define contact frequencies between different genomic regions. All these approaches have strongly contributed to our knowledge of how the human genome is packed in the cell nucleus.In this chapter, we describe detailed step-by-step protocols for 3D immuno-DNA FISH detection of genes and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) provirus in primary CD4+ T cells from healthy donors, or cells infected in vitro with the virus. Our multicolor 3D-FISH technique allows, by using up to three fluorophores, visualization of spatial positioning of loci inside a 3D cell nucleus.

TITLE: 3D Depth Profile Reconstruction of Segregated Impurities using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry.

PMID: 32421009
DOI: 10.3791/61065

ABSTRACT:
The presented protocol combines excellent detection limits (1 ppm to 1 ppb) using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) with reasonable spatial resolution (~1 µm). Furthermore, it describes how to obtain realistic three-dimensional (3D) distributions of segregated impurities/dopants in solid state materials. Direct 3D depth profile reconstruction is often difficult to achieve due to SIMS-related measurement artifacts. Presented here is a method to identify and solve this challenge. Three major issues are discussed, including the i) nonuniformity of the detector being compensated by flat-field correction; ii) vacuum background contribution (parasitic oxygen counts from residual gases present in the analysis chamber) being estimated and subtracted; and iii) performance of all steps within a stable timespan of the primary ion source. Wet chemical etching is used to reveal the position and types of dislocation in a material, then the SIMS result is superimposed on images obtained via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thus, the position of agglomerated impurities can be related to the position of certain defects. The method is fast and does not require sophisticated sample preparation stage; however, it requires a high-quality, stable ion source, and the entire measurement must be performed quickly to avoid deterioration of the primary beam parameters.

AUTHORS: Burr Stephanie D, Stewart James A
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2020)
PMID: 32716370
DOI: 10.3791/61527

ABSTRACT:
Cell migration is a key component in both physiological and pathological events. Normal cell migration is required for essential functions such as development and mounting an immune response. When a defect or alteration occurs with the cell migration process, it can have detrimental outcomes (i.e., cancer metastasis, wound healing, and scar formation). Due to the importance of cell migration, it is necessary to have access to a cell migration assay that is affordable, adaptable, and repeatable. Utilizing the common scratch migration assay, we have developed a new approach to analyzing cell migration that uses general laboratory equipment. The method described uses visual markers that allow for recapturing specific areas of interest without the use of time-lapse microscopy. In addition, it provides flexibility in the experimental design, ranging from altering the migration matrix substrate to the addition of pharmacological modifiers. Furthermore, this protocol outlines a way to account for the area of cell migration, which is not considered by several methods when examining cell migration. This new approach offers a scratch migration assay to a larger audience and will provide greater opportunity for researchers to examine the physiological and pathophysiological impact of cell migration.

PMID: 32510489
DOI: 10.3791/60873

ABSTRACT:
The opsono-adherence assay is a functional assay that enumerates the attachment of bacterial pathogens to professional phagocytes. Because adherence is requisite to phagocytosis and killing, the assay is an alternative method to opsono-phagocytic killing assays. An advantage of the opsono-adherence assay is the option of using inactivated pathogens and mammalian cell lines, which allows standardization across multiple experiments. The use of an inactivated pathogen in the assay also facilitates work with biosafety level 3 infectious agents and other virulent pathogens. In our work, the opsono-adherence assay was used to assess the functional ability of antibodies, from sera of animals immunized with an anthrax capsule-based vaccine, to induce adherence of fixed Bacillus anthracis to a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Automated fluorescence microscopy was used to capture images of bacilli adhering to macrophages. Increased adherence was correlated with the presence of anti-capsule antibodies in the serum. Non-human primates that exhibited high serum anti-capsule antibody concentrations were protected from anthrax challenge. Thus, the opsono-adherence assay can be used to elucidate the biological functions of antigen specific antibodies in sera, to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates and other therapeutics, and to serve as a possible correlate of immunity.

ABSTRACT:
CRISPR/Cas9 system has significant advantages in gene editing strategy, offering cost-effective and efficient means to modify and edit the genomes of animals, plants, and microorganisms. Three-dimensional (3D) genome is an emerging and interdisciplinary field catapulted by combined technological breakthroughs of chromosome conformation capture with next-generation sequencing and live imaging with super-resolution microscopy. An important aspect of 3D genomics is to model structural variations and label specific genomic fragments to investigate the effects of manipulation of genomic elements on gene expression regulation, cell development and differentiation, and spatial location of chromosomal regions. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9 system and its derivative technologies of DNA-fragment editing are excellent toolboxes for investigating dynamics and functions of the higher-order chromatin organization and three-dimensional genome structure. In this review, we describe the opportunities and challenges of CRISPR as well as its derivative technologies in 3D genome research, thereby providing some critical references and future research directions in the field. CRISPR/Cas9系统在基因编辑方面具有巨大优势,能够低成本、可编程、方便快捷地用于动物、植物以及微生物的基因组靶向编辑和功能改造。三维基因组学是近年来兴起的一门研究染色质高级结构动态调控及基因组生物学功能的交叉学科。在三维基因组研究中,通常采用对DNA片段进行基因编辑以模拟基因组结构性变异,标记特定DNA片段,进而研究调控元件对于基因调控、细胞分化、组织发生、器官形成、个体发育的影响,最终阐明三维基因组的组装调控机制和生物学功能。因此,CRISPR及其衍生技术为研究三维基因组提供了极好的遗传学工具。本文主要综述了CRISPR片段编辑及其衍生技术在三维基因组调控与功能研究中的应用,以期为后续研究工作提供理论参考以及新的研究思路。.

ABSTRACT:
A protocol is presented to build a custom low-cost yet high-performance femtosecond (fs) fiber laser. This all-normal-dispersion (ANDi) ytterbium-doped fiber laser is built completely using commercially available parts, including $8,000 in fiber optic and pump laser components, plus $4,800 in standard optical components and extra-cavity accessories. Researchers new to fiber optic device fabrication may also consider investing in basic fiber splicing and laser pulse characterization equipment (~$63,000). Important for optimal laser operation, methods to verify true versus apparent (partial or noise-like) mode-locked performance are presented. This system achieves 70 fs pulse duration with a center wavelength of approximately 1,070 nm and a pulse repetition rate of 31 MHz. This fiber laser exhibits the peak performance that may be obtained for an easily assembled fiber laser system, which makes this design ideal for research laboratories aiming to develop compact and portable fs laser technologies that enable new implementations of clinical multiphoton microscopy and fs surgery.

ABSTRACT:
Life is spatially partitioned within lipid membranes to allow the isolated formation of distinct molecular states inside cells and organelles. Cell fusion is the merger of two or more cells to form a single cell. Here we provide a protocol for cell fusion of two different cell types. Fused hybrid cells are enriched by flow cytometry-based sorting, followed by fluorescence microscopy of hybrid cell structure and function. Fluorescently tagged proteins generated by genome editing are imaged inside fused cells, allowing cellular structures to be identified based on fluorescence emission and referenced back to the cell type of origin. This robust and general method can be applied to different cell types or organelles of interest, to understand cellular structure and function across a range of fundamental biological questions.

TITLE: Preparation of Newborn Rat Brain Tissue for Ultrastructural Morphometric Analysis of Synaptic Vesicle Distribution at Nerve Terminals.
AUTHORS: Ferrarese Bianca, Lunardi Nadia
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2019)
PMID: 31233032
DOI: 10.3791/59694

ABSTRACT:
Our laboratory and many others have exploited the high resolving power of transmission electron microscopy to study the morphology and spatial organization of synaptic vesicles. In order to obtain high-quality electron micrographs that can yield the degree of morphological detail necessary for quantitative analysis of pre-synaptic vesicle distribution, optimal specimen preparation is critical. Chemical fixation is the first step in the process of specimen preparation, and of utmost importance to preserve fine ultrastructure. Vascular fixation with a glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde solution, followed by treatment of vibratome-sectioned specimens with osmium tetroxide, stabilizes the maximum number of molecules, especially proteins and lipids, and results in superior conservation of ultrastructure. Tissue is then processed with counterstaining, sequential dehydration and resin-embedding. En bloc staining with uranyl acetate (i.e., staining of vibratome-sectioned tissue before resin embedding) enhances endogenous contrast and stabilizes cell components against extraction during specimen processing. Contrast can be further increased by applying uranyl acetate as a post-stain on ultrathin sections. Double-staining of ultrathin sections with lead citrate after uranyl acetate treatment also improves image resolution, by intensifying electron-opacity of nucleic acid-containing structures through selective binding of lead to uranyl acetate. Transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterization of the morphological details of synaptic vesicles and quantification of their size and spatial organization in the terminal bouton. However, because it uses fixed tissue, transmission electron microscopy can only provide indirect information regarding living or evolving processes. Therefore, other techniques should be considered when the main objective is to study dynamic or functional aspects of synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2019)
PMID: 31282879
DOI: 10.3791/58698

ABSTRACT:
To simulate Cryptococcus infection, amoeba, which is the natural predator of cryptococcal cells in the environment, can be used as a model for macrophages. This predatory organism, similar to macrophages, employs phagocytosis to kill internalized cells. With the aid of a confocal laser-scanning microscope, images depicting interactive moments between cryptococcal cells and amoeba are captured. The resolution power of the electron microscope also helps to reveal the ultrastructural detail of cryptococcal cells when trapped inside the amoeba food vacuole. Since phagocytosis is a continuous process, quantitative data is then integrated in the analysis to explain what happens at the timepoint when an image is captured. To be specific, relative fluorescence units are read in order to quantify the efficiency of amoeba in internalizing cryptococcal cells. For this purpose, cryptococcal cells are stained with a dye that makes them fluoresce once trapped inside the acidic environment of the food vacuole. When used together, information gathered through such techniques can provide critical information to help draw conclusions on the behavior and fate of cells when internalized by amoeba and, possibly, by other phagocytic cells.

PMID: 31762448
DOI: 10.3791/59513

ABSTRACT:
The electron celadonite source described here performs well in a low-energy electron point-source projection microscope in long-range imaging. It presents major advantages compared to sharp metal tips. Its robustness affords a lifetime of months and it can be used under relatively high pressure. The celadonite crystal is deposited at the apex of a carbon fiber, maintained itself in a coaxial structure ensuring a spherical beam shape and easy mechanical positioning to align the source, the object and the electron-optical system axis. There is a single crystal deposition via generation of celadonite-containing water droplets with a micropipette. Scanning electron microscopy observation can be performed to verify the deposition. However, this adds steps and therefore increases the risk of damaging the source. Thus, after preparation, the source is usually inserted directly under vacuum in the projection microscope. A first high voltage supply provides the kick-off needed to start the electron emission. The field emission process involved is then measured: it has already been observed for dozens of electron sources prepared in this way. The brightness is under-estimated through an over-estimation of source size, intensity at one energy and cone angle measured in a projection system.

Single-molecule localization microscopy probes the position and motions of individual molecules in living cells with tens of nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution. These capabilities make single-molecule localization microscopy ideally suited to study molecular level biological functions in physiologically relevant environments. Here, we demonstrate an integrated protocol for both acquisition and processing/analysis of single-molecule tracking data to extract the different diffusive states a protein of interest may exhibit. This information can be used to quantify molecular complex formation in living cells. We provide a detailed description of a camera-based 3D single-molecule localization experiment, as well as the subsequent data processing steps that yield the trajectories of individual molecules. These trajectories are then analyzed using a numerical analysis framework to extract the prevalent diffusive states of the fluorescently labeled molecules and the relative abundance of these states. The analysis framework is based on stochastic simulations of intracellular Brownian diffusion trajectories that are spatially confined by an arbitrary cell geometry. Based on the simulated trajectories, raw single-molecule images are generated and analyzed in the same way as experimental images. In this way, experimental precision and accuracy limitations, which are difficult to calibrate experimentally, are explicitly incorporated into the analysis workflow. The diffusion coefficient and relative population fractions of the prevalent diffusive states are determined by fitting the distributions of experimental values using linear combinations of simulated distributions. We demonstrate the utility of our protocol by resolving the diffusive states of a protein that exhibits different diffusive states upon forming homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes in the cytosol of a bacterial pathogen.

TITLE: Photostimulation by Femtosecond Laser Activates Extracellular-signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) Signaling or Mitochondrial Events in Target Cells.

ABSTRACT:
Direct control of cellular defined molecular events is important to life science. Recently, studies have demonstrated that femtosecond laser stimulation can simultaneously activate multiple cellular molecular signaling pathways. In this protocol, we show that through coupling femtosecond laser into a confocal microscope, cells can be stimulated precisely by the tightly-focused laser. Some molecular processes that can be simultaneously observed are subsequently activated. We present detailed protocols of the photostimulation to activate extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in Hela cells. Mitochondrial flashes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other mitochondrial events can be also stimulated if focusing the femtosecond laser pulse on a certain mitochondrial tubular structure. This protocol includes pretreating cells before photostimulation, delivering the photostimulation by a femtosecond laser flash onto the target, and observing/identifying molecular changes afterwards. This protocol represents an all-optical tool for related biological researches.

ABSTRACT:
The design and synthesis of a synthetic system that aims for the direct visualization of a synthetic rotary motor at the single molecule level on surfaces are demonstrated. This work requires careful design, considerable synthetic effort, and proper analysis. The rotary motion of the molecular motor in solution is shown by 1H NMR and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy techniques. In addition, the method to graft the motor onto an amine-coated quartz is described. This method helps to gain more insight into molecular machines.

DOI: 10.3791/59084

ABSTRACT:
The present study combines in utero transduction with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) aiming at a precise morphometrical analysis of ultrastructural parameters in unambiguously identified topographical structures, affected by a protein of interest that is introduced into the organism via viral transfer. This combined approach allows for a smooth transition from macrostructural to ultrastructural identification by following topographical navigation maps in a tissue atlas. High-resolution electron microscopy of the in-utero-transduced tissue reveals the fine ultrastructure of the neuropil and its plasticity parameters, such as cross-sectioned synaptic bouton areas, the number of synaptic vesicles and mitochondria within a bouton profile, the length of synaptic contacts, cross-sectioned axonal areas, the thickness of myelin sheaths, the number of myelin lamellae, and cross-sectioned areas of mitochondria profiles. The analysis of these parameters reveals essential insights into changes of ultrastructural plasticity in the areas of the nervous system that are affected by the viral transfer of the genetic construct. This combined method can not only be used for studying the direct effect of genetically engineered biomolecules and/or drugs on neuronal plasticity but also opens the possibility to study the in utero rescue of neuronal plasticity (e.g., in the context of neurodegenerative diseases).

ABSTRACT:
Manual vascular reconstruction training is essential for a beginner surgeon. However, an optimal training system for vascular reconstruction in vitro has yet to be developed. In this study, we introduce an in vitro training and testing system using a magnetic anchoring technique with which a trainee can practice manual vascular reconstruction individually. Additionally, this system can also be used to test the quality of the reconstruction. The described system includes a vascular reconstruction training machine, magnetic tractors, and a magnetic suture puller. In this manuscript, we detail an end-to-end vein anastomosis using porcine right and left iliac veins. To identify the potential damage caused by a magnetic suture puller on the suture, we created three groups with six segments of 4-0 polypropylene sutures each: a control group with no intervention on the polypropylene suture, a group in which the polypropylene suture is manually pulled with sterile gloves 20x, and a magnetic puller group in which the magnetic puller pulled the polypropylene suture 20x. These groups were tested by light microscopy and breaking strength tests, and the effect of reconstruction was assessed. In the light microscopy test, the control group was less likely to be damaged (p < 0.05) and the number of damaged points of the manual group and magnetic puller group were similar (p > 0.05). The results of the breaking strength test were compared across groups and no significant difference was observed (p > 0.05). The end-to-end anastomosis of the porcine iliac veins was successfully performed using this training system, and the reconstructed veins could undergo 2.0 kPa perfusion pressure. Using this training and testing system the trainee can practice manual vascular reconstruction in vitro individually with the aid of magnetic tractors and a magnetic suture puller, and the quality of the reconstruction can be tested.

TITLE: Synthesis Method for Cellulose Nanofiber Biotemplated Palladium Composite Aerogels.
AUTHORS: Burpo Fred J, Palmer Jesse L, Mitropoulos Alexander N, Nagelli Enoch A, Morris Lauren A, Ryu Madeline Y, Wickiser J Kenneth

ABSTRACT:
Here, a method to synthesize cellulose nanofiber biotemplated palladium composite aerogels is presented. Noble metal aerogel synthesis methods often result in fragile aerogels with poor shape control. The use of carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) to form a covalently bonded hydrogel allows for the reduction of metal ions such as palladium on the CNFs with control over both nanostructure and macroscopic aerogel monolith shape after supercritical drying. Crosslinking the carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibers is achieved using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in the presence of ethylenediamine. The CNF hydrogels maintain their shape throughout synthesis steps including covalent crosslinking, equilibration with precursor ions, metal reduction with high concentration reducing agent, rinsing in water, ethanol solvent exchange, and CO2 supercritical drying. Varying the precursor palladium ion concentration allows for control over the metal content in the final aerogel composite through a direct ion chemical reduction rather than relying on the relatively slow coalescence of pre-formed nanoparticles used in other sol-gel techniques. With diffusion as the basis to introduce and remove chemical species into and out of the hydrogel, this method is suitable for smaller bulk geometries and thin films. Characterization of the cellulose nanofiber-palladium composite aerogels with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, thermal gravimetric analysis, nitrogen gas adsorption, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry indicates a high surface area, metallized palladium porous structure.

TITLE: The Use of Mouse Mammary Tumor Cells in an In Vitro Invasion Assay as a Measure of Oncogenic Cell Behavior.
AUTHORS: Schmidt John A, Knepper Janice E
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2019)
PMID: 31259903
DOI: 10.3791/59732

ABSTRACT:
The in vitro invasion assay uses a protein-rich matrix in a Boyden chamber to measure the ability of cultured cells to pass through the matrix and a porous membrane in a process analogous to the initial steps of cancer cell metastasis. The tested cells can be altered for the gene expression or treated with inhibitors to test for changes in the invasion potential. This experiment tests the aggressive phenotype of the mouse mammary tumor cells to discover and characterize the potential oncogenes that promote cell invasion. This technique, however, can be versatile and adapted to many different applications. The experiment itself can be done in one day and the results are acquired by light microscopy in less than a day. The results include counts of the number of invading cells for comparison and analysis. The in vitro invasion assay is a rapid, inexpensive, and clear-cut method for determining cell behavior in a culture that can be used as an initial assessment before more involved in vivo assays.

TITLE: Isolation of F1-ATPase from the Parasitic Protist Trypanosoma brucei.
AUTHORS: Gahura Ondřej, Zíková Alena
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2019)
PMID: 30735175
DOI: 10.3791/58334

ABSTRACT:
F1-ATPase is a membrane-extrinsic catalytic subcomplex of F-type ATP synthase, an enzyme that uses the proton motive force across biological membranes to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The isolation of the intact F1-ATPase from its native source is an essential prerequisite to characterize the enzyme's protein composition, kinetic parameters, and sensitivity to inhibitors. A highly pure and homogeneous F1-ATPase can be used for structural studies, which provide insight into molecular mechanisms of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. This article describes a procedure for the purification of the F1-ATPase from Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiases. The F1-ATPase is isolated from mitochondrial vesicles, which are obtained by hypotonic lysis from in vitro cultured trypanosomes. The vesicles are mechanically fragmented by sonication and the F1-ATPase is released from the inner mitochondrial membrane by the chloroform extraction. The enzymatic complex is further purified by consecutive anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Sensitive mass spectrometry techniques showed that the purified complex is devoid of virtually any protein contaminants and, therefore, represents suitable material for structure determination by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. The isolated F1-ATPase exhibits ATP hydrolytic activity, which can be inhibited fully by sodium azide, a potent inhibitor of F-type ATP synthases. The purified complex remains stable and active for at least three days at room temperature. Precipitation by ammonium sulfate is used for long-term storage. Similar procedures have been used for the purification of F1-ATPases from mammalian and plant tissues, yeasts, or bacteria. Thus, the presented protocol can serve as a guideline for the F1-ATPase isolation from other organisms.

ABSTRACT:
This method allows the separation of trypanosomes, parasites responsible for animal and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), from infected blood. This is the best method for diagnosis of first stage HAT and furthermore this parasite purification method permits serological and research investigations. HAT is caused by Tsetse fly transmitted Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. Related trypanosomes are the causative agents of animal trypanosomiasis. Trypanosome detection is essential for HAT diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. The technique described here is the most sensitive parasite detection technique, adapted to field conditions for the diagnosis of T. b. gambiense HAT and can be completed within one hour. Blood is layered onto an anion-exchanger column (DEAE cellulose) previously adjusted to pH 8, and elution buffer is added. Highly negatively charged blood cells are adsorbed onto the column whereas the less negatively charged trypanosomes pass through. Collected trypanosomes are pelleted by centrifugation and observed by microscopy. Moreover, parasites are prepared without cellular damage whilst maintaining their infectivity. Purified trypanosomes are required for immunological testing; they are used in the trypanolysis assay, the gold standard in HAT serology. Stained parasites are utilized in the card agglutination test (CATT) for field serology. Antigens from purified trypanosomes, such as variant surface glycoprotein, exoantigens, are also used in various immunoassays. The procedure described here is designed for African trypanosomes; consequently, chromatography conditions have to be adapted to each trypanosome strain, and more generally, to the blood of each species of host mammal. These fascinating pathogens are easily purified and available to use in biochemical, molecular and cell biology studies including co-culture with host cells to investigate host-parasite relationships at the level of membrane receptors, signaling, and gene expression; drug testing in vitro; investigation of gene deletion, mutation, or overexpression on metabolic processes, cytoskeletal biogenesis and parasite survival.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Dermal melanocytosis is a group of pigmentary dermatological diseases associated with melanocytic proliferation, which are classified based on their number and depth at the level of the dermis; they may be congenital or acquired. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old male patient with no history of importance for the current condition started 5 years ago with a dark macula in the left hand palm, which was asymptomatic but grew gradually. On physical examination, dermatoses affecting the left palm, palmar face of proximal phalanges of the third, fourth and fifth fingers, characterized by the presence of blackish greyish macula, diffuse and irregular edges, not infiltrated or indurated were detected. The dermatoscopy identified a pattern of pigment with a greyish-brown tone with brown areas, showing whitish spots inside. In the histopathology, the presence of spindle cells was observed in the superficial and middle dermis, with a large nucleus and the presence of a melanic pigment inside, with perivascular distribution and intermingled with the collagen fibres. Based on the clinical characteristics and the histopathological findings, acquired dermal melanocytosis of the hand was concluded as the final diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Case reports of atypical acquired dermal melanocytosis are infrequent. Dermal melanocytosis of the hand is a rare variant of these diseases, of which less than 10 cases have been reported. At present, this case of dermal melanocytosis is the first reported in Latin America with the aim to extend the knowledge of its clinical-histological and dermatoscopic characteristics. INTRODUCCIÓN: Las melanocitosis dérmicas son un grupo de enfermedades dermatológicas pigmentarias asociadas con la proliferación melanocítica. Se clasifican con base en su número y localización profunda a nivel de la dermis; pueden ser congénitas o adquiridas. CASO CLÍNICO: Paciente de sexo masculino de 11 años de edad, sin antecedentes de importancia para el padecimiento actual. Inicio con mácula oscura en la palma de la mano izquierda hace 5 años, asintomática, de crecimiento paulatino. A la exploración física, se detectó dermatosis que afectaba la palma izquierda, cara palmar de las falanges proximales del tercer y cuarto dedos, caracterizada por la presencia de mácula grisácea negruzca, bordes difusos e irregulares, no infiltrada ni indurada. En la dermatoscopia se detectó un patrón de pigmento de tono gris acero con áreas de color café, y con evidencia de puntos blanquecinos dentro de estas. En la histopatología se identificaron células fusiformes, con núcleo grande y la presencia de pigmento melánico en su interior, con distribución perivascular y entremezclados con las fibras de colágeno en la dermis superficial y media. Con base en las características clínicas e histopatológicas de la lesión, se concluyó melanocitosis dérmica adquirida de la mano como el diagnóstico definitivo. CONCLUSIONES: Los reportes de casos de melanocitosis dérmica adquiridas atípicas son infrecuentes. La melanocitosis dérmica de la mano es una variante de estas enfermedades, de la que existen menos de 10 casos. Se presenta el primer caso reportado en Latinoamérica hasta el momento, con el objetivo de ampliar el conocimiento de sus características clínico-histológicas y dermatoscópicas.

ABSTRACT:
We demonstrated that the high spatial resolution absorption contrast imaging of the crystal of vitamin B9 has absorption at ultraviolet wavelengths. The absorption wavelength matches with the wavelength of the emission of the fluorescent thin film of an electron-beam excitation-assisted (EXA) optical microscope. The fine crystal structure was imaged beyond the optical diffraction limit. The image contrast corresponded with the thickness of the crystal. The illumination light is absorbed with the vitamin B9 crystal and the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the thickness of the vitamin B9 crystal. The EXA optical microscope is useful for analysis of growth of a crystal, bioimaging and so on.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To investigate the feasibility of low tube voltage, low contrast medium concentration, injection rate and volume (quadri-low) combined with automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and iterative model reconstruction (IMR) technology in head and neck CT angiography (CTA). Methods: A total of 70 patients whose body mass index (BMI)<25 kg/m(2) underwent head and neck CTA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from January to July 2017 were enrolled in this prospective study. According to random number table, patients were divided into two groups: group A (n=35) was scanned according to the protocol of 120 kV, 150 mAs, 50 ml and 5 ml/s iopromide (370 mg/ml) and filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction; group B (n=35) was scanned with 80 kV, ATCM with mean tube current of 100 mAs, 30 ml and 3 ml/s iohexol (300 mg/ml) and IMR; the other parameters kept consistent between the two groups. The maximum transverse neck diameter at the level of the hyoid bone, artery CT value and image noise were measured, signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and figure of merit (FOM) were calculated, and the image quality was evaluated subjectively and compared with those reconstructed by DSA. Scan length, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) were recorded, and the effective dose (ED) was calculated. The chi-square and independent-sample t tests were used to compare the inter-group differences in these aforementioned data. Resutls: No significant difference was found in general information between the two groups. No significant difference existed in artery CT value, image noise, SNR and CNR between the two groups (t=-1.170-1.365, all P>0.05); however, the FOM of group B (74±40) was significantly higher than that in group A (12±4) (Z=-7.195, P=0.000). The image quality of the two groups met the requirement of clinical diagnosis[(4.1±0.7) vs (4.2±0.8) points, Z=-0.592, P>0.05], no significant difference was found in subjective evaluation and diagnostic efficacy. The CTDIvol, DLP and ED in group B were all significantly lower than those in group A (Z=-7.728, -7.202, -7.206, all P<0.05). The iodine load and iodine delivery rate (IDR) of group B was lower than that of group A (18.5 g vs 9.0 g, 1.85 mg/s vs 0.90 mg/s), and they were reduced for 51.4% in group B. Conclusions: For patients of BMI <25 kg/m(2,) low tube voltage, low contrast medium concentration, injection rate and volume combined with ATCM and IMR technology can significantly decrease radiation dose, iodine load and IDR while maintain the image quality in head and neck CTA examination. 目的： 探讨低电压和低对比剂浓度、注射速率及注射剂量的"四低"技术，联合自动管电流调节(ATCM)和全模型迭代重建(IMR)技术在头颈部CT血管成像(CTA)中的可行性。 方法： 2017年1至7月于苏州大学附属第一医院前瞻性收集70例因需行头颈部CTA和数字减影血管造影(DSA)检查且体质指数(BMI)<25 kg/m(2)的患者纳入研究。按随机数字表将受试者分为A、B两组，每组各35例。A组采用120 kV、固定管电流为150 mAs、50 ml及5 ml/s对比剂碘普胺(含碘370 mg/ml)和滤波反投影(FBP)重建；B组采用80 kV、平均管电流为100 mAs的ATCM技术、30 ml及3 ml/s对比剂碘海醇(含碘300 mg/ml)和IMR；其余扫描参数2组一致。测量并计算舌骨层面最大直径、动脉CT值、噪声、信噪比(SNR)、对比噪声比(CNR)和图像灵敏度(FOM)，并对图像质量进行主观评价及与DSA结果对照。记录扫描长度、容积CT剂量指数(CTDIvol)和剂量长度乘积(DLP)，计算有效剂量(ED)。对2组间数据结果分别采用χ(2)检验、两独立样本t检验来进行比较。 结果： 2组患者一般资料具有可比性。2组图像动脉CT值、噪声、SNR和CNR差异均无统计学意义(t＝－1.170～1.365，均P>0.05)；但B组FOM明显高于A组(74±40比12±4，Z＝－7.195，P＝0.000)。2组图像质量均符合临床诊断要求[(4.1±0.7)比(4.2±0.8)分，Z＝－0.592，P>0.05]，主观评价及诊断效能的差异均无统计学意义。B组CTDIvol、DLP和ED均低于A组，差异均有统计学意义(Z＝－7.728、－7.202、－7.206，均P<0.05)；A、B组对比剂碘摄入量分别为18.5、9.0 g，对比剂碘流率分别为1.85、0.90 mg/s，B组较A组均减少51.4%。 结论： 对于BMI<25 kg/m(2)患者，采用低电压和低对比剂浓度、注射速率及注射剂量联合ATCM和IMR技术行头颈部CTA检查，在保证图像质量的同时明显降低了辐射剂量和对比剂碘摄入量及碘流率。.

TITLE: Subsampling phase retrieval for rapid thermal measurements of heated microstructures.
AUTHORS: Taylor Lucas N, Talghader Joseph J
JOURNAL: Optics letters (2016)
PMID: 27420492
DOI: 10.1364/OL.41.003189

ABSTRACT:
A subsampling technique for real-time phase retrieval of high-speed thermal signals is demonstrated with heated metal lines such as those found in microelectronic interconnects. The thermal signals were produced by applying a current through aluminum resistors deposited on soda-lime-silica glass, and the resulting refractive index changes were measured using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a microscope objective and high-speed camera. The temperatures of the resistors were measured both by the phase-retrieval method and by monitoring the resistance of the aluminum lines. The method used to analyze the phase is at least 60× faster than the state of the art but it maintains a small spatial phase noise of 16 nm, remaining comparable to the state of the art. For slowly varying signals, the system is able to perform absolute phase measurements over time, distinguishing temperature changes as small as 2 K. With angular scanning or structured illumination improvements, the system could also perform fast thermal tomography.

We show that isolation and localization of the scattering (versus diffractive) point-spread function can be done by individually illuminating or individually darkening image segments. We experimentally demonstrate reconstruction of both bright and dark sources. Further, we show that self-focusing nonlinearity improves the localization accuracy for bright sources.

ABSTRACT:
Angioma serpiginosum (AS) is an unusual vascular disorder that typically affects female patients, begins in childhood and stabilizes in adulthood and not frequently involve acral skin. We herein present a 13 year-old girl with an asymptomatic erythematous punctuate first noticed on the right palm three years ago, with a proximal serpiginous progression up to the forearm. On examination there was a nonblanching erythematous punctuate on the palm and the inner aspect of right hand and forearm. Dermoscopy showed an erythematous parallel ridge pattern with some red globules and dots spreading on a linear arrangement, and the acrosyringia openings were not affected. Histopathological study showed dilated capillaries in the dermal papillae. This feature is consistent with angioma serpiginosum (AS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that shows a dermoscopic image of a palmar AS. The dermoscopic pattern described in this case could aid in the diagnosis of AS and could add a value in the differential diagnosis with vascular lesions on acral skin.

ABSTRACT:
In super-resolution microscopy based on fluorescence depletion, the two-color phase plate (TPP) is an indispensable optical element, which can independently control the phase shifts for two beams of different color, i.e., the pump and erase beams. By controlling a phase shift of the erase beam through the TPP, the erase beam can be modulated into a doughnut shape, while the pump beam maintains the initial Gaussian shape. To obtain a reliable optical multiplayer (ML) for the TPP, we designed a ML with only two optical layers by performing numerical optimization. The measured phase shifts generated by the fabricated ML using interferometry correspond to the design values. The beam profiles in the focal plane are also consistent with theoretical results. Although the fabricated ML consists of only two optical layers, the ML can provide a suitable phase modulation function for the TPP in a practical super-resolution microscope.

ABSTRACT:
Tight association of peripheral chromatin with nuclear lamina unavoidably creates topological constraints during replication. Additional complications are associated with high stability of lamina meshwork, which may hinder an access of replication factors to the sites of DNA synthesis in highly condensed template with limited mobility. In the current work we studied structural organization and dynamics of lamina as a function of replicative status of associated peripheral heterochromatin. The studies of molecular mobility of laminas at various stages of S-phase in vivo and using super-resolution microscopy showed no correlation between lamina dynamics and replicative status of attached heterochromatin. These data support the hypothesis that lamina-chromatin interactions during S-phase are regulated at the level of adapter proteins. Ultrastructural studies have demonstrated that temporal break of lamina-chromatin connections during replication does not cause noticeable spatial separation of replicating domains from nuclear periphery.

AUTHORS: Lekić Branislav, Janković Biljana, Nikolić Miloš
JOURNAL: Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC (2013)
PMID: 23683485

ABSTRACT:
Circumscribed palmar or plantar hypokeratosis (CPH) is a rare condition, usually asymptomatic, consisting of a well-demarcated erythema with central depression and hyperkeratotic border which divides it from the normal skin. We report a 77-year-old woman with a characteristic lesion of circumscribed palmar hypokeratosis on the right palm. Clinically, the lesion simulated porokeratosis of Mibelli, but histologically there was no cornoid lamella, while the characteristic depression of epidermis, with sharp stair in stratum corneum between the normal and involved skin was present. This is the first case of CPH reported in south-east Europe. After 9-year follow-up and various treatment modalities, we confirmed resistance of CPH. Since malignant transformation has been documented, careful follow-up was recommended.

TITLE: IR super-resolution microspectroscopy and its application to single cells.
AUTHORS: Sakai Makoto, Inoue Keiichi, Fujii Masaaki
JOURNAL: Current pharmaceutical biotechnology (2013)
PMID: 22356113

ABSTRACT:
For many years, spatial resolution is the most critical problem in IR microspectroscopy. This is because the spatial resolution of a conventional infrared microscope is restricted by the diffraction limit, which is almost the same as the wavelength of IR light, ranging from 2.5 to 25 μm. In the recent years, we have developed two novel types of far-field IR super-resolution microscopes using 2-color laser spectroscopies, those are transient fluorescence detected IR (TFD-IR) spectroscopy and vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. In these ways, because both transient fluorescence and VSFG signal have a wavelength in the visible region, the image is observed at the resolution of visible light, which is about 10 times smaller than that of IR light (that is, IR super-resolution). By using these techniques, we can map the specific IR absorption band with sub-micrometer spatial resolution, visualization of the molecular structure and reaction dynamics in a non-uniform environment such as a cell becomes a possibility. In the present reviews, we introduce our novel IR super-resolution microspectroscopy and its application to single cells in detail.

PMID: 23381293
DOI: 10.1364/OL.37.003468

ABSTRACT:
Phase-shifting fringe projection is the primary structured illumination method for high-accuracy, three-dimensional (3D) shape measurements in the fields of profilometry and stereophotogrammetry. Many different schemes for the phase evaluation and the phase-shifted fringe pattern design exist. Here we focus on the role of the phase evaluation in the context of stereophotogrammetry, where the nominal phase value itself is merely used as an image feature that can be exploited to establish a correspondence between the two camera views. Starting from the classical phase evaluation function, we will discuss its essential properties for a highly accurate correspondence mapping. Based on the findings, we generalize the classical function to derive a generalized phase value for a sequence of stereo images. An experimental comparison between a correspondence assignment using the classical phase evaluation function and a specifically chosen general phase evaluation function is given.

ABSTRACT:
Taking into account the fact, that unsatisfactory results of treatment of the thumbs traumatic damage are significantly caused by presence of anatomic disruption of the thumbs palm's own arteries with chronic tissue ischemia occurrence. One of consequences of damage of the three-phalanx thumbs interphalanx joints and the thumbs palm's own arteries is a formation of quickly progressing secondary flexing contracture of proximal interphalanx joints (PIPHJ). In the investigations accomplished there was established, that the changed tissues of the flexors tendons and their sheaths, forming cicatricial blockade distally to the primary trauma site, are taking part in a PIPHJ contracture development while arterial perfusion presence.The tissues damage severity, as well as a severity of clinical features of the tendons and their sheaths damage, depends on a degree of an arterial perfusion disorder present,

TITLE: Scopulariopsis brevicaulis as the cause of dermatomycosis.
AUTHORS: Petanović Mirna, Tomić Paradzik Maja, Kristof Zeljka, Cvitković Ante, Topolovac Zdenka
JOURNAL: Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC (2010)
PMID: 20361882

ABSTRACT:
Scopulariopsis (S.) brevicaulis (Saccardo) Bainier 1907 is a ubiquitous fungus frequently isolated as a saprophyte from various layers of the soil, wood, straw, paper, food, and occasionally in animals and humans. This nondermatophyte filamentous fungus is multiresistant and is frequently associated with onychomycosis in humans. In the last two decades, the number of reports on its pathogenic role in different localized and disseminated infections has been on an increase. Identification was done by native KOH microscopy and culture on the Mycobios selective agar (Biolife). From January 1, 2002 till January 23, 2008, a total of 7161 samples were examined by use of mycology methods; S. brevicaulis accounted for 39 (2.2%) of 1834 (25.6%) positive samples. During the study period, S. brevicaulis was isolated from nail, skin and scalp scrapings of 39 patients (17 male and 22 female), mean age ( SD) 43.920.7 (range 8-87) years. Specimens were most frequently obtained from the foot (n=16; 41%), i.e. great toe nail in 10 and other foot areas in 6 cases, followed by palm and fingers in 8 (20.5%), scalp in 3 (7.7%) and other parts of the body in 12 (30.8%) cases. Most of the study subjects lived in a rural setting (n=22; 56%), working as farmers in close contact with the soil and domestic animals. Seventeen (44%) subjects were from urban setting (n=9) or unknown place of residence (n=8). Underlying risk factors were present in 29 (74%) of 39 study subjects, some of them with multiple risk factors. Besides close contact with the soil, the most common predisposing factors were various dermatoses (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, dysseborrhea, etc.), lower extremity circulatory insufficiency, trauma, microtrauma, and metabolic disorders. Although the clinical picture of onychomycosis caused by S. brevicaulis shows some specific features, timely sampling for mycology is crucial to verify the diagnosis and to identify the causative agent prior to the introduction of appropriate therapy for dermatomycosis.

PMID: 19256456

ABSTRACT:
The economic importance of the palm Bactris gasipaes is growing in the Neotropoical region. We collected leaflets from plants under a chemical fertilization regime and a population of 5000 plants per hectare, in Costa Rica. The variety, Diamantes 10, has an ascendency fom the upper Amazon basin. We used Harries hematoxiline, eocine and standard light microscopy techniques. The presence of raphids and buliform cells was confirmed for the abaxial surface of the leaflets and for the hypodermic tissue on both sides. The absence of the Krantz anatomy was confirmed in consistence with former observations about the C3 photosynthesis in other species of Palmaceae. The average stomatal density on the abaxial surface was 96.87 +/- 16.31 stomata.mm(-2) and 14.20 +/- 4.05 in the adaxial surface.

TITLE: Effect of D-004, a lipid extract from Cuban royal palm fruit, on histological changes of prostate hyperplasia induced with testosterone in rats.
AUTHORS: Noa M, Arruzazabala M L, Carbajal D, Más R, Molina V
JOURNAL: International journal of tissue reactions (2005)
PMID: 16440586

ABSTRACT:
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the nonmalignant, uncontrolled growth of prostate gland cells and stroma leading to difficulty in urinating. Lipid extracts from Saw palmetto (Arecaceae) fruits are used to treat BPH. The Cuban royal palm (Roystonea regia) is a member of this family and D-004, a lipid extract from its fruits, prevents prostate hyperplasia (PH) induced with testosterone, as opposed to dihydrotestosterone, in rodents. This study investigated whether D-004 could prevent the histological features of testosterone-induced PH in rats. Rats were distributed into six groups (10 rats per group): A negative control group receiving subcutaneous injections of soy oil and treated with vehicle, and five groups injected subcutaneously with testosterone and treated with the vehicle (positive control), D-004 (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) or Saw palmetto (400 mg/kg). Treatments were given orally for 14 days. At sacrifice, prostates were removed and processed for light microscopy. The histopathological findings of PH were assessed according to a score-chart protocol. D-004 200 and 400 mg/kg, but not 100 mg/kg, significantly and moderately in a dose-dependent manner prevented prostate enlargement and the testosterone-induced histological changes. Compared with positive controls, D-004 200 and 400 mg/kg inhibited prostate size increases and the histological score up to 56.1% and 60.7%, respectively, while Saw palmetto 400 mg/kg reduced such variables by 45.8% and 49.0%, respectively. The effects of D-004 400 mg/kg on the histological changes, not on prostate size, were greater (p < 0.05) than those of Saw palmetto. D-004 and Saw palmetto did not affect body weight values. In conclusion, D-004 200 and 400 mg/kg administered orally for 14 days prevented the increase of prostate size and the testosterone-induced histological changes in rats, its effects being comparable or mildly better than those of Saw palmetto. These results extend previous data showing preventive effects of D-004 on testosterone-induced prostate enlargement with in rodents, and further studies are required to explore the mechanisms underlying such effects.

TITLE: An iridescent virus and a microsporidium in the biting midge Culicoides barbosai from Florida.
AUTHORS: Fukuda Tokuo, Kline Daniel L, Day Jonathan E
JOURNAL: Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association (2002)
PMID: 12083356

ABSTRACT:
An iridescent virus and a microsporidium (Nosema sp.) were found infecting larvae of the biting midge Culicoides barbosai collected in Boynton Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida. Larvae were extracted from mud collected weekly during a 22-month period from March 1998 to December 1999. Virus-infected larvae were present in 4 collections made in March, April, and May 1998 and the average infection level was 4.7% (range 2.3-7.1%). The virus infected the fat body and produced an iridescent blue color in larvae because of the crystalline arrays of the particles. These virus particles were hexagonal, measured 99 nm from side to side, and had an electron-dense inner core. The site of infection of the Nosema sp. also was the fat body of the larva, which became opaque white. These opaque areas were the result of masses of oval binucleate spores measuring 2.7+/-0.1 x 4.4+/-0.3 microm (n = 25). The Nosema sp. was present in larvae of 14 collections made during the 22-month period, with an average infection level of 6.1% (range 0.3-21.4%). Although individual larvae infected with the iridescent virus and Nosema sp. occurred in 4 collections, no dual infections were observed. Larvae patently infected with the iridescent virus and Nosema sp. died before pupation.

TITLE: Association of lignifying enzymes in shell synthesis of oil palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis--dura variety).
AUTHORS: Bhasker S, Mohankumar C
JOURNAL: Indian journal of experimental biology (2001)
PMID: 11480213

ABSTRACT:
Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation demonstrates the differentiation of mesocarp and endocarp tissues and their lignified nature in dura fruits at 8 weeks after pollination (WAP). During shell formation, the endocarp cells become lignified to a hard shell while the mesocarp tissue remains cellular and fibrous. A transition zone made up of fibrous units was also visible beneath the shell. The soluble phenols of mesocarp and endocarp tissues at their developmental stage was analyzed using Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The appearance of ferulic acid at 4 WAP and its absence at 8 WAP indicates the role of ferulic acid in lignin synthesis. The HPLC data was supported by the lignin concentration. To ascertain the biochemical relationship of lignin pathway enzymes, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamyl alcohol-NADPH-dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD) with shell synthesis, the activities of these enzymes and lignin content were assessed during development of the shell between 4 and 8 WAP. The three enzymes, PAL, CAD and POD expressed high level of activity in the mesocarp and endocarp at 4 WAP. At 8 WAP a sharp decline in activity was observed in the endocarp whereas the mesocarp showed a moderate reduction. This variation is an indication of the role of these enzymes in shell formation.

AUTHORS: Zentek J, Stampa G, Hahn H, Kamphues J
JOURNAL: DTW. Deutsche tierarztliche Wochenschrift (1999)
PMID: 10547930

ABSTRACT:
A high frequency of constipation was observed in calves with an average body weight of 150 kg. Eleven out of 200 animals died, at necropsy intestinal obstruction was identified due to agglomeration of stone like particles, identified as shell fragments of palm kernels. The calves were fed 3 kg maize silage, 1.5 kg of a commercial mixed feed, 0.5 kg soya meal, and 50 g of a mineral supplement. Hay was offered ad libitum, all animals had free access to drinking water. The composition of the mixed diet was estimated by microscopy and was completely different from the label as provided by the manufacturer. A palm kernel product with high amounts of stone shells was identified in a concentration of 25% of the mixed feed, confirming the findings in the necropsied calves. The pathogenesis of the obstruction seemed to be influenced by a concurrent infectious disease, which might have had negative effects on the gastro-intestinal motility.

PMID: 10518404

ABSTRACT:
INTRODUCTION: Erythema dyschromicum perstans (ashy dermatosis) is a very rare skin disease included in the group of acquired, idiopathic hypermelanosis, with development of blue-gray macules. This disease appears more frequently in dark coloured persons, especially women in the first and second life decade. CASE REPORT: A male patient, 42 years of age, was admitted to Clinic of Dermatovenereology in Novi Sad due to appearance of slightly pruriginous, brown-reddish macules on the trunk, upper and lower extremities, without affecting the skin of the face, scalp, palm soles and visible mucous membranes. Later, the color of the macules changed into blue-gray and new lesions appeared in axilla and flexor side of the big joints, with active, erythematous and thin raised borders. Laboratory findings showed no abnormalities; antinuclear antibodies were negative. Histopathological examination of the skin specimens (which were taken from two different places) showed vacuolar degeneration of the basal cell layer, numerous pigmentophages in papillary dermis and presence of lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in dermis. No history of drug intake or exposure to UV light was established. DISCUSSION: Ashy dermatosis is included in the group of hypermelanosis of unknown origin. As possible etiological factors we can mention ingestion of ammonium nitrate, environmental pollution, hypersensitivity to cobalt chloride and postinflammatory pigmentation. Clinical characteristics: occurrence of blue-gray and gray macules on the trunk, face, neck and extremities (absence on the palms, soles, visible mucous membranes, scalp and nails). In the active phase of the disease, these macules are surrounded by erythematous and thin, raised borders. The lesions are mostly permanent. Due to clinical, histopathological, immunofluorescent and electron microscopy established similarities with lichen planus, it is considered that ashy dermatosis is a variant of lichen planus. Absence of previous drug intake, exposure to UV light, absence of the antinuclear antibodies, clinical picture and histological findings confirm the diagnosis of erythema dyschromicum perstans. CONCLUSION: This case of ashy dermatosis shows that there is a need for differential diagnosis of acquired skin pigmentations, because this dermatosis must also be taken into consideration.

TITLE: Regional difference in expression of characteristic abnormality of harlequin ichthyosis in affected fetuses.
AUTHORS: Akiyama M, Dale B A, Smith L T, Shimizu H, Holbrook K A
JOURNAL: Prenatal diagnosis (1998)
PMID: 9621376

ABSTRACT:
Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is a severe congenital ichthyosis in which newborn infants are covered with a thick plate of stratum corneum. We examined skin specimens from a variety of regions of the body including the scalp, face, tongue, trunk, upper and lower extremities, digits, palms, and soles of three fetuses affected with HI that were diagnosed prenatally. In all the skin regions, characteristic morphological abnormalities (absent or abnormal lamellar granules and intercellular lamellae, lipid inclusions in the cornified cells) were expressed in the late second trimester of the fetal period. The cornified cells in hair canals showed morphological abnormalities of HI more strongly than the interfollicular epidermis. Immunoblot study of epidermal extracts revealed that profilaggrin was much more prominent than filaggrin in all the hairy skin regions where the hair canals were extensively keratinized, but filaggrin was prominent in the palm. These observations support the idea that, in the hairy skin, HI phenotype expression is associated with keratinization and abnormal filaggrin metabolism in hair. In addition, the prenatal diagnosis or prenatal exclusion of HI is thought to be possible from whichever site of the fetal body the skin biopsy is taken in the late second trimester of the fetal period.

ABSTRACT:
We report the case of a patient in whom lichen nitidus with hemorrhage was found on the palm and the thigh. Histopathologically, the small vessels in the lesions showed extensive changes and were increased in number. The capillary walls revealed degenerative changes with extravasation of erythrocytes. On electron microscopy, amorphous, electron-dense deposits were observed along the outside of the endothelial cells. These findings can explain the presence of the hemorrhagic changes. We describe this as a case of purpuric lichen nitidus.

JOURNAL: International journal of cardiac imaging (1997)
PMID: 9080237
DOI: 10.1023/a:1005705523499

ABSTRACT:
Digital image data acquired during cardiac catheterization will soon be archived on standardized digital storage media. However, with the enormous amount of generated data, considerable time will be wasted at later reviewing or at conferences, or when performing additional quantitative studies. As a result major advantages of a digital acquisition and archiving technique will be lost. The concept of two way archiving includes an unedited (primary) digital archive as well as a (secondary) archive edited by operator guided "intelligent" data reduction (IDR). IDR is based upon the elimination of useless and redundant frame sequences (FS), documentation of coronary interventions on one representative single frame (F) and on the reduction of relevant FS and physiological data to and ECG-controlled representative cardiac cycle (CC). With a heart rate of 72/min and an acquisition rate of 12.5 F/s a documentation of each FS may be obtained with only 10 F. A redundancy-free set of 130 F of a diagnostic study as well as only 41-85 F of an interventional study will be archived on an individual 3.5" MOD or on a CD-R. Two cardiologists and two cardiosurgeons studied independently 24 IDR-edited and the corresponding unedited digital angiograms and found no significant differences in the diagnostically relevant coronary morphology and left ventricular function. IDR provides an edited digital coronary angiogram, e.g. a set of images free of redundance and without loss of relevant information. Uneditable FS can be archived in their unedited (primary) form. IDR is managed on-line by an operator interacting with the angiographer.

TITLE: Effects of docosahexaenoic acid and sardine oil diets on the ultrastructure of jejunal absorptive cells in adult mice.
AUTHORS: Tamura M, Suzuki H
JOURNAL: Annals of nutrition & metabolism (1996)
PMID: 9001686
DOI: 10.1159/000177966

ABSTRACT:
The influence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and sardine oil diets on the ultrastructure of jejunal absorptive cells was studied. Adult male Crj:CD-1 (ICR) mice were fed a fat-free semisynthetic diet supplemented with 5% (by weight) purified DHA ethyl ester, refined sardine oil, or palm oil. The mice received the DHA or palm oil diets for 7 days (groups 1 and 2) and the refined sardine oil or palm oil diets for 30 days (groups 3 and 4). There were significant ultrastructural changes in the jejunal absorptive cells between the mice fed on the palm oil diet and those receiving the DHA and sardine oil diets. The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of some jejunal absorptive cells in the mice fed on the palm oil diet for 7 and 30 days developed vacuolation on the upper site of the nucleus. In contrast, many granules, which appeared to be lipid droplets, were observed in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the jejunal absorptive cells in the DHA and sardine oil diet groups. These results suggest that ultrastructural differences in the jejunal absorptive cells between mice in the omega-3 fatty acid and palm oil diet groups may be associated with the changes in lipid metabolism.

At the initial and main phase of the storm the normal circadian structure in each cardiovascular parameter was lost. The asynchronicity was growing together with the storm and abrupt drop of cardia activity was observed during the main phase of storm. The main phase of storm followed by the destruction and degradation of cardiomyocytes. Parameters of cardia activity became substantially synchronized and characterised by circadian rhythm structure while the amplitude of deviations was still significant at the recovery stage of geomagnetic storm.

ABSTRACT:
A 39-year-old woman had numerous keratotic papules on the volar surface of the right palm, both soles, fingers and toes. There were some spiny plugs on the edges of her toes. Histologic examination revealed a cornoid lamella. "Punctate porokeratotic keratoderma" "porokeratosis punctata palmaris et plantaris" refer probably to related conditions "keratosis punctate palmaris et plantaris". We prefer the term "punctate porokeratotic keratoderma".

ABSTRACT:
The experiments on intact rabbits have shown that geomagnetic storm breaks the relationship between the size of myocardial mitochondria and the degree of cardiac contractility, causes swelling and further destruction of mitochondria. Geomagnetic storm leads to a decline in the left ventricular contractility. The development of geomagnetic storm is associated with a significant strong positive correlation between the size of mitochondria and the blood level of free fatty acids.

ABSTRACT:
Sweat glands from the palm of a patient with hyperhidrosis were examined by light and electron microscopy before and after treatment with tap water iontophoresis. No changes in structure were noted after treatment, disclaiming the currently accepted theory that mechanical ductal obstruction is the mechanism of action of this method. Furthermore, we believe the safety and effectiveness of this treatment are supported by our experience.

ABSTRACT:
By employing various staining techniques the pituitary cells of the squirrels, Funambulus pennanti, can broadly be divided into 'acidophilic', 'basophilic' and 'amphophilic' types. The acidophilic cell types include somatotrophs and lactotrophs. The basophilic cell types include thyrotrophs, folliculotrophs and interstitiotrophs while the amphophilic cells are recognized as corticotrophs. The identification of the pituitary cells and their histochemical characteristics are described at the light microscopical level. Attempt has been made to interpret the cells identified in the present study on a comparative and tinctorial basis.

PMID: 2435243

ABSTRACT:
In the adult palm squirrel, F. pennanti the pineal is a club shaped, elongated structure with a connective tissue capsule. It consists of various types of pinealocytes, glial cells, neurons, nerve fibres, blood vessels and connective tissue. Two types of pinealocytes could be identified by light microscopy. They are large rounded with centrally placed nucleus, and small rounded pinealocytes. They have medium sized processes stainable with Alcian blue, periodic acid Schiff and Nissl methods. The pinealocytes are not stainable with bromophenol blue. However, they are moderately stainable with PAS, Sudan black and Baker's acid hematin. Neurons are seen either singly or in groups with axonal processes. Cystic cavities often lined by cells are a normal feature of adult squirrel pineal, and the lining cells are both pinealocytes and glial cells. Often neuronal endings are seen terminating on these lining cells. PAS positive globules were also seen inside the cysts. In some squirrel pineals, fibrous cysts with an inner core of cells are also seen. Occasionally groups of lymphocytes were also encountered in the pineal. In the fetal pineal, the cells are both larger and smaller ones and arranged in a cortex and medulla pattern and no cystic cavities are seen. The third ventricle enters the base of the pineal as pineal recess.

TITLE: Transcranial ultrasound localization microscopy of the rat brain with ray theory-based aberration correction.

JOURNAL: Ultrasonics (2026)
PMID: 40914147
DOI: 10.1016/j.ultras.2025.107802

ABSTRACT:
Transcranial ultrasound localization microscopy (t-ULM) is faced with challenges posed by the skull, including acoustic attenuation and phase aberrations. There is a significant request for an efficient aberration correction method achieving a great balance between computational complexity and accuracy. In this study, the ray theory is first applied to in-vivo transcranial imaging to calculate the traveltime table in the inhomogeneous medium model of the imaging region. The velocity model is derived through the skull segmentation, and the autofocus method is employed to estimate the longitudinal wave speed of the skull. The validity of the proposed method is substantiated through time-domain simulations and in-vivo t-ULM experiments in rat brains. Results show that the ray theory-based aberration correction enables a spatial resolution improvement of 15.3 % (about 5.3 μm) and an imaging saturation enhancement of 3.6 % on average, revealing the vessels down to 27.6 μm in diameter. Moreover, the vasculature in the cerebral cortex, affected by multiple reflections, can be reconstructed successfully by the intensity compensation. This work provides an efficient ray theory-based solution to the aberration and its first in-vivo validation in t-ULM. The effect of speed estimation errors of the rat skull on aberration correction was clarified. Ray theory-based method holds great promise for transcranial microvascular imaging.

TITLE: Dissection of Drosophila melanogaster Indirect Flight Muscles for Microscopy Approaches.
AUTHORS: DeCata Jenna, Morgan Aaron, Ficken Sienna, Spletter Maria L
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 41284581
DOI: 10.3791/69185

ABSTRACT:
The indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of Drosophila melanogaster are a powerful genetic model to explore foundational principles of myogenesis. The contractile mechanism and many sarcomere components are conserved from flies to vertebrates, enabling the study of cellular processes from transcriptional regulation and RNA processing to metabolism and mechanobiology that direct and fine-tune muscle development. Many of these cellular pathways are altered in human myopathies, and IFM studies provide relevant insight into the molecular etiology of muscle disease. In particular, flies are well-suited for microscopy to analyze myofiber and sarcomere morphology and function across the entire process of IFM myogenesis, from myoblast specification to myofibril formation, maturation, and maintenance. Here, a protocol is presented for the dissection of D. melanogaster IFMs at pupal and adult timepoints for microscopy approaches. Illustrated protocols are provided for hemithorax dissection of late pupal and adult IFMs, as well as open-book dissection of early pupal IFMs. Fixation, staining, and sample mounting procedures and common dissection artifacts are described, with representative data demonstrating the compatibility of IFM dissection with different fixation reagents. These protocols are applied to study the hypomorphic SmnE33 allele of RNA-binding protein survival motor neuron (Smn)at 26 h after puparium formation (APF), 72 h APF, and in adult IFMs, providing new insight into a Spinal Motor Atrophy (SMA) model and illustrating the general utility of this protocol. This detailed protocol facilitates access to the IFM model system and acquisition of high-quality microscopy data to investigate principles of myogenesis.

ABSTRACT:
Microscopy, particularly of the fluorescent kind, is a frequently used tool in C. elegans research. The analysis of data from microscopy experiments can, however, be quite tedious and time-consuming. Thus, automation is desirable. We developed SegElegans, a two-headed U-net-based convolutional neural network system that is specifically designed for the automated segmentation of worms, even in images with large numbers of touching or overlapping individuals. The first part of SegElegans consists of one encoder and two decoders. The encoder, based on the SmaAt AT model, applies double convolution layers followed by a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Both decoders use convolutional LSTMs: one performs semantic segmentation of worm images (body, edge, background, or overlap), while the other extracts a linear skeleton along each worm. The second part is a post-processing algorithm that combines the outputs of the two decoders and uses them to generate accurate instance segmentations. These segmentations can then be fed to ImageJ or other appropriate image analysis tools. Here we present instructions on how to access and run this system. We provide an online, cloud computing-based implementation as well as two methods to use the SegElegans models offline, on a local machine, should the required hardware be available.

ABSTRACT:
With socio-economic development, the prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases has significantly decreased year by year. However, parasitic infections remain a major public health issue globally, particularly in developing countries and regions. Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial for controlling the spread of these diseases. The traditional Direct Wet Smear Microscopy method, while widely used, is labor-intensive, prone to contamination, and dependent on the skills of the technician. This paper introduces an Automatic Fecal Analyzer, which automates the stool sample processing, offering advantages over the traditional Direct Wet Smear Microscopy method, such as ease of operation, rapid detection, a clean and hygienic working environment, and high sensitivity and specificity, thus enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. We compared three different methods for fecal analysis: direct wet smear microscopy method, automatic fecal analyzer (AI report), and automatic fecal analyzer (user audit). The AI report uses automated image analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify components like parasites and eggs in fecal samples. This method can process a large number of samples quickly, increasing efficiency. The User Audit also uses an automatic fecal analyzer but includes an additional step of user audit. Experienced technicians review the AI report to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the results.The analyzer demonstrated a sensitivity of 84.31% for AI report and 94.12% for user audits, along with a specificity of 98.71% for AI reports and 99.69% for user audits, making it an invaluable tool for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of parasitic infections.

TITLE: Understanding the Changes in Mitochondrial Morphology through Dynamic and Three-dimensional Fluorescence Micrographs.

PMID: 40889258

ABSTRACT:
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that are vital to the survival of any animal, undergoing regular fission and fusion events in response to the needs or stresses of the host, leading to the constant remodeling of the mitochondrial network. Because of this, being able to evaluate the mitochondrial network in three dimensions, as well as over time, offers a benefit in understanding how the system responds to factors such as stress or pharmaceutical intervention. Fluorescence imaging of the mitochondrial networks of cells enables the ability to visualize and monitor these changes. However, the mitochondrial network is often described as a two-dimensional and static structure that is defined by unstandardized metrics. Therefore, we set out to describe a pipeline that enables the user to prepare their images for the mitochondrial event localizer (MEL), an ImageJ plugin tool that detects fission and fusion events in the mitochondrial network over time and in a 3-dimensional manner, thus, offering insight into the dynamic changes that this network undergoes. Additionally, we describe the benefits of understanding fission and fusion in light of the changes in the mitochondrial count and morphological changes.

AUTHORS: Lessieur Emma M, Kern Timothy S
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 39927662
DOI: 10.3791/67220

ABSTRACT:
Leukostasis refers to the attachment of leukocytes to the luminal wall of the vasculature. This interaction of leukocytes with the wall of blood vessels is characteristic of inflammation and has been causally linked to capillary occlusion in a variety of tissues and diseases, including diabetic retinopathy. Leukostasis has been reported for years as a life-threatening complication of hyperleukocytosis and can only be diagnosed clinically. Given the importance of the phenomenon, intensive research has been done to understand the potential mechanism(s) that lead to its manifestation; however, there is no gold-standard technique in laboratory settings to visualize and quantify the severity of the event. In the method summarized below, the vasculature is initially perfused with a buffer to remove blood, and then, concanavalin A is perfused into the vasculature where it binds to all exposed cell walls and causes especially bright staining of leukocytes. If the perfusion to remove all unbound blood cells was successful, the remaining fluorescently labeled leukocytes are bound to the vasculature, and they can be manually quantified using any available fluorescence microscope.

DOI: 10.3791/6614

ABSTRACT:
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief due to concerns about the integrity of the data presented. These concerns included: (a) Figure 3 was found to contain noise without structural features expected for a protein capsid; (b) critical half-map data necessary to verify resolution claims were not deposited; (c) there was a lack of system logs or controls to rule out stage drift regarding observed movements in Figure 3; and (d) the absence of protocols to address Brownian motion and beam-induced drift significantly weakened the reliability of the findings. The corresponding author's indication she principally relied on RMEASURE program did not sufficiently address the publisher's concerns. After consulting external experts, the Editors-in-Chief concluded that the issues remain unresolved, and the data do not meet JoVE's standards for scientific reliability and reproducibility, requiring retraction.  The corresponding author disagrees with the grounds for retraction.  Co-authors DiCecco, Grandfield and Bator agree with the retraction.  Other co-authors were unavailable for comment.

DOI: 10.3791/67926

ABSTRACT:
Dermoscopy is an important non-invasive form of examination that plays a critical role in the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases accompanied by skin lesions. This technique is performed in real-time and can thus assist in determining the skin biopsy site. Skin lesions are common and important manifestations of most rheumatic diseases, including lupus erythematosus. In some rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the incidence of skin rashes may not be as high; however, those lesions that do develop can be diverse and deceptive, thereby complicating diagnosis. Dermoscopy and the observation of microscopic characteristics can assist in diagnosing primary diseases in their early stages. Herein, we present a protocol that provides a detailed overview of the standardized operation process of dermoscopy. Further, using discoid lupus erythematosus as an example, we demonstrate the important role of dermoscopy in the diagnosis of many different rheumatic diseases. Finally, we discuss the diverse dermoscopic manifestations of different rheumatic diseases and their associated skin lesions.

ABSTRACT:
Soft magnetoactive elastomers (MAEs) are smart materials that respond to external magnetic fields by dynamically altering their mechanical properties. They are composed of magnetically responsive microparticles embedded within a soft polymer matrix, exhibiting an effective shear modulus of up to 100 kPa. In recent decades, MAEs' bulk properties have been successfully exploited for applications such as dynamic vibration damping, vibration sensing, and actuation in soft robotics. Recent research has shifted to their surface properties, revealing promising results on tunable surface features such as roughness, adhesion, and wetting. Even the transport of small solid and fluid objects was demonstrated. The associated surface effects can be significantly enhanced through the precise engineering of surface topography. In this article, an efficient laser micromachining technique, with a resolution of 15 µm, is presented, which enables rapid prototyping of MAE surfaces. It allows the creation of various complex shapes and offers functionality beyond the one achievable with traditional molding techniques. Additionally, the approach is versatile and can be applied to any polymer that sufficiently absorbs the laser light. As an example, a lamellar surface micro-pattern fabrication process and its characterization by optical and scanning electron microscopies are shown. Its response to a magnetic field is demonstrated. The technique provides a flexible and fast solution for optimizing polymer surface design across a wide range of applications.

PMID: 40587455
DOI: 10.3791/67852

ABSTRACT:
Mechanical forces guide many critical cellular processes, and cellular mechanical phenotype, or mechanotype, is disrupted in many diseases. The most widely used method to quantify cellular forces is traction force microscopy, which traditionally captures forces that cells exert on their surroundings by high-resolution microscopy of cells deforming elastic substrates containing fluorescent beads, deflecting microposts, or altering the conformation of immobilized molecular tension sensors. We present here a high-throughput method to measure relative cellular traction forces using established DNA tension probes and quantified via flow cytometry. There are five overall steps involved in this method described below. First, expression and purification of the high-affinity integrin ligand echistatin fused to a DNA-linking HUH-tag; second, preparation of the DNA duplex probes containing reporters and ligand; third, surface preparation and immobilization of probes; fourth, execution of the "Rupture and Deliver" tension-gauge-tether experiment and flow readout. Finally, we will describe data analysis and interpretation of experimental results.

TITLE: Detection of Anti-MDA5 Autoantibodies Using HeLa Cells and Immunocytochemistry with Light Microscopy.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2025)
PMID: 41247993
DOI: 10.3791/67575

ABSTRACT:
Anti-MDA5 autoantibodies are critical biomarkers for dermatomyositis (DM), amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM), and polymyositis (PM), particularly in identifying patients at risk of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD). Early detection of these autoantibodies is essential to improve patient outcomes, as delayed diagnosis often leads to poor prognoses. Currently, radioimmunoassay is the gold standard for detecting anti-MDA5, but its use is limited by high costs, lengthy procedures, and the need for specialized expertise. Additionally, the blot test, a widely used clinical tool, exhibits a high false-positive rate for MDA5 autoantibodies, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a non-radioactive, highly sensitive, and standardized confirmatory testing method using Immunocytochemistry (ICC). This protocol involves treating HeLa cells with an MDA5 construct, permeabilizing the cells with Triton X-100 to facilitate binding of primary anti-MDA5 autoantibodies, and detecting bound antibodies using enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies (e.g., horseradish peroxidase) with DAB chromogen for microscopy imaging. ICC offers a practical, cost-effective, and high-sensitivity approach for visualizing anti-MDA5 autoantibodies within cellular structures. By integrating ICC as a supplementary confirmatory procedure, this study aims to enhance the reliability of anti-MDA5 detection, thereby improving diagnostic and prognostic strategies for RP-ILD in DM, CADM, and PM patients.

TITLE: 2.5D Model for Ex Vivo Mechanical Characterization of Sprouting Angiogenesis in Living Tissue.

ABSTRACT:
Sprouting angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature and is of great importance for physiological such as tissue growth and repair and pathological processes, including cancer and metastasis. The multistep process of sprouting angiogenesis is a molecularly and mechanically driven process. It consists of induction of cellular sprout by vascular endothelial growth factor, leader/follower cell selection through Notch signaling, directed migration of endothelial cells, and vessel fusion and stabilization. A variety of sprouting angiogenesis models have been developed over the years to better understand the underlying mechanisms of cellular sprouting. Despite advancements in understanding the molecular drivers of sprouting angiogenesis, the role of mechanical cues and the mechanical driver of sprouting angiogenesis remains underexplored due to limitations in existing models. In this study, we designed a 2.5D ex vivo model that enables us to mechanically characterize cellular sprouting from a porcine carotid artery using traction force microscopy. The model identifies distinct force patterns within the sprout, where leader cells exert pulling forces and follower cells exert pushing forces on the matrix. The model's versatility allows for the manipulation of both chemical and mechanical cues, such as matrix stiffness, enhancing its relevance to various microenvironments. Here, we demonstrate that the onset of sprouting angiogenesis is stiffness-dependent. The presented 2.5D model for quantifying cellular traction forces in sprouting angiogenesis offers a simplified yet physiologically relevant method, enhancing our understanding of cellular responses to mechanical cues, which could advance tissue engineering and therapeutic strategies against tumor angiogenesis.

ABSTRACT:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health concern that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB pose a serious threat to global public health. Traditional diagnostic methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), such as smear microscopy and culture, have significant limitations and often result in delayed clinical treatment. To address this challenge, an efficient diagnostic scheme based on real-time fluorescent PCR was developed. High-quality MTB nucleic acids can be extracted from test samples, and resistance status can be identified at key resistance sites. Compared to traditional methods, this approach significantly reduces detection time to just a few hours, enabling the determination of infection and resistance status shortly after a patient's initial visit. Detection sensitivity exceeds 85%, and specificity reaches 95%. This non-invasive technology not only minimizes patient discomfort but also supports accurate diagnosis in grassroots medical institutions due to its low cost and high efficiency. Overall, the approach represents a significant improvement in TB diagnostics.

TITLE: Micro-Injury of the Tendon-Bone Junction Caused by Acute Exhaustive Exercise in Rats: Ultrastructural Changes and Mechanism.

ABSTRACT:
Exercise-induced micro-injuries at the tendon-bone junction (enthesis) can lead to tendinopathy. Investigating the ultrastructural changes and mechanisms within the enthesis following acute exhaustive exercise can improve our understanding of tendinopathy and guide clinical treatments. In this study, thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two groups: control and exhaustive exercise. The exhaustive exercise group was further subdivided into five subgroups based on the time post-exercise: 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and electron microscopy were employed to examine changes in the calcaneal tendon-bone junction. The expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins GRP78, CHOP, and Caspase-12 at the tendon-bone junction was quantified using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Following acute exhaustive exercise, the tendon-bone junctions of rats that underwent exhaustive exercise displayed significant structural alterations. Chondrocytes and collagen fibers exhibited notable ultrastructural changes indicative of ERS. ERS protein levels increased immediately after exercise, peaking at 6 h. These protein levels began to decline at 12 h post-exercise and returned to baseline by 48 h. In conclusion, acute exhaustive exercise induces micro-damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress at the tendon-bone junction in rats, but no irreversible damage ensues. Timely treatment and repair of these micro-injuries can prevent excessive damage and the development of tendinopathy.

TITLE: Mettl3/Nrf2 Axis Suppresses Parkinson's Disease Progression via Inhibiting NLRP3-Induced Pyroptosis in Serotonin Neurons.

ABSTRACT:
The precise mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding the role of microglial inflammation and serotonin neuron survival. This protocol delineates a comprehensive framework for elucidating how methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) modulates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) through N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, thereby attenuating microglial pyroptosis and preserving serotonin neurons in both in vitro and in vivo PD models. The primary goal is to furnish researchers with reproducible methodologies for dissecting epitranscriptomic regulation of neuroinflammatory pathways, commencing with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation in BV2 cells to simulate inflammatory cascades, followed by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (MeRIP-qPCR) for m6A analysis. In vivo, we detail the establishment of an MPTP-induced PD mouse model, complemented by stereotactic delivery of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors for targeted Nrf2 modulation in the striatum. Behavioral evaluations encompass forelimb placement, accelerating rotarod, and open field tests to quantify motor deficits, while molecular assays include Western blotting for pyroptosis markers (e.g., NLRP3, cleaved-caspase-1), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for cytokines, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection in serotonin neurons. Advanced microscopy techniques, such as immunohistochemistry for Iba1 and TPH2, enable visualization of microglial dynamics and serotonergic integrity. Results substantiate that Mettl3 deficiency exacerbates Nrf2 downregulation, NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation, pyroptotic cell death, and consequent serotonin neuron degeneration. This method not only provides a robust experimental scaffold for probing m6A-mediated neuroprotection but also highlights potential therapeutic avenues for mitigating PD progression through targeted modulation of the Mettl3/Nrf2 axis in neurodegenerative contexts.

TITLE: In vivo and In vitro Infection of Potato Roots with Plant Parasitic Nematodes for the Assessment of Induced Structural Changes.

ABSTRACT:
Soil-dwelling plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are important potato pests that cause lesions and/or change plant roots structure, leading to reduced crop fitness and productivity. Research on the cellular and subcellular mechanisms of PPNs infection and development can resort to field plants or seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Field studies are more representative of natural environments but are subjected to the unpredictability of environmental conditions that can heavily influence research outcomes. Greenhouse studies allow higher control over environmental variables and higher safety against contaminants or pathogens. However, in some hosts, genetic diversity becomes an important factor of variability and influences the host-parasite complex response. We have developed in vitro co-cultures of transgenic roots with PPNs as a reliable alternative that occupies less space, requires less time to obtain, and is free from contamination or from host genetic variability. Co-cultures are obtained by introducing aseptic PPNs to host in vitro transgenic roots. They can be maintained indefinitely, which makes them excellent support for keeping collections of reference PPNs. In the present work, a protocol is detailed for the controlled infection of in vivo potato roots with the root lesion nematode and for establishing in vitro co-cultures of potato transgenic roots with the root-knot nematode. The in vitro co-cultures provided a laboratory proxy for the natural potato infection condition and produced nematode life stages irrespective of season or climate conditions. Additionally, the methodology used for structural analysis is detailed using histochemistry and optical microscopy. The acid fuchsin dye is used to follow nematode attack sites on roots, while differential staining with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and toluidine blue O highlights nematode structures in potato internal root tissue.

ABSTRACT:
Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are becoming increasingly used in the field of cancer research to model tumors. They combine the benefits of in vivo and traditional in vitro models, recapitulating tissue complexity and heterogeneity while still consisting of human cells. The rise of physiologically representative PDO models has prompted a need for devices that enable straightforward analysis of organoid behavior. This protocol explains how to assemble and use the Scaffold-supported Platform for Organoid-based Tissues (SPOT), a high-throughput, three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture device. This platform eliminates the meniscus typically formed by seeded hydrogels to allow accurate, quick imaging, similar to the imaging process for two-dimensional (2D) cultures. As a result, organoids and co-cultures seeded in SPOT can easily be imaged using high-throughput microscopy. Designed for off-the-shelf use, SPOT is accessible to researchers with basic tissue culture experience and is compatible with both manual and automated seeding workflows. This protocol details the fabrication of SPOT in 96- and 384-well formats, including step-by-step instructions for assembly, seeding, quality control, and troubleshooting. While fabrication requires 3-4 h, excluding idle time, multiple plates can be produced simultaneously, improving scalability. By streamlining PDO culture and analysis, SPOT provides a robust tool for high-throughput drug screening and translational cancer research.

ABSTRACT:
Anteromesial temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is a useful treatment option for drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (DRmTLE). Growing evidence suggests the piriform cortex plays a crucial role in the generation and propagation of seizures in DRmTLE - and that the resection of the temporal portion of the piriform cortex is associated with significantly improved rates of seizure freedom. Here, we present the resection of the temporal portion of the piriform cortex in ATLR, using high-resolution preoperative probabilistic tractography algorithms and fused anatomical masks of the structures of interest into the intraoperative neuronavigation and microscope head-up display (HUD). All patients undergoing comprehensive preoperative assessment and investigations for DRmTLE provided informed, written consent to record an intraoperative video of the procedure. Patients were identified by an expert multidisciplinary team of epileptologists, epilepsy neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, neuropsychiatrists, and electrophysiologists at a large epilepsy surgery center. The preoperative imaging pipeline included the delineation of critical structures. This included the temporal piriform cortex, and high-resolution probabilistic tractography for essential tracts at risk (e.g., optic radiation and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus). These were co-registered to the preoperative volumetric neuronavigation scan and uploaded to the intra-operative neuronavigation system. Presented here is a step-by-step procedure of ATLR, including the resection of the temporal portion of the piriform cortex. The protocol combines Advanced structural and diffusion MR imaging and intraoperative visual aids to integrate anatomical masks of critical grey matter structures and white matter tracts into the surgical workflow in the operating room.

TITLE: Neuroprotective Effects of Intranasally Administered Octadecaneuropeptide Analog in a Mouse Model of MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease.

ABSTRACT:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which existing therapies are primarily palliative and lack curative efficacy. Octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) is a peptide exclusively produced by astrocytes that protects neurons against oxidative cell damage and apoptosis in in vitro and in vivo models of PD. However, ODN cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and requires intracerebroventricular injection to reach the brain, presenting a significant challenge for therapeutic application. This study investigates the neuroprotective efficacy of cyclo(1-8)OP, an ODN analog, delivered via the intranasal (IN) route to bypass the BBB in an in vivo model of PD. Male C57BL/6J mice were used for the experiments and divided into four groups: sham, MPTP- (20 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal), cyclo(1-8)OP- (10 ng/10 µL, IN), and MPTP + cyclo(1-8)OP-treated animals. On day 0 (D0), animals received three intraperitoneal injections of 100 µL MPTP solution at 2-h intervals (MPTP- and MPTP + cyclo(1-8)OP-treated mice) or saline solution (sham and cyclo(1-8)OP-treated mice). One hour after the final injection, 10 µL of IN instillation of cyclo(1-8)OP (cyclo(1-8)OP- and MPTP + cyclo(1-8)OP-treated mice) or IN saline solution (sham and MPTP-treated mice) was administered. On D7, a cylinder test was performed to assess motor function. Subsequently, animals were sacrificed, and the striatum was removed and analyzed by RT-qPCR to assess caspase-3 gene expression. Tissue samples were also used to measure antioxidant enzyme activities, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and carbonylated protein abundance. A single IN dose of 10 ng cyclo(1-8)OP, administered 1 h after the final MPTP dose, prevented neurotoxicity in the striatum 7 days post-treatment. Cyclo(1-8)OP-mediated neuroprotection was associated with strong inhibition of caspase-3 expression induced by MPTP in the striatum. Additionally, cyclo(1-8)OP restored the activities of antioxidant enzymes, preventing the accumulation of ROS, lipid peroxidation products, and protein carbonylation in the striatum.

ABSTRACT:
A functional form of amyloid aggregate can be rapidly induced by various environmental stressors, yielding subnuclear structures called amyloid bodies (A-bodies). Here, we describe a cell-based high-throughput assay to identify anti-amyloidogenic compounds capable of impairing heat-induced A-body formation in adherent cell lines. We describe steps for generating reporter cell lines, optimizing scoring algorithms, screening compound libraries, and analyzing results. This assay can be expanded to various systems to identify compounds with both anti- and pro-amyloidogenic effects.

JOURNAL: Current protocols (2025)

ABSTRACT:
This protocol set focuses on the preparation of the BD FACSAria II/III/Fusion, a cuvette-based cell sorting system commonly found in shared resource settings, to sort submicron samples, including but not limited to virus-like particles (VLPs) and bacteria. This is meant to serve as a proven workflow for staff in general shared resource laboratories (SRL) and individual labs. It is also useful for labs purchasing cuvette-based sorters with similar fluidic paths to the FACSAria Fusion from BD Biosciences, such as the BD FACSSymphony S6 and BD FACSDiscover S8, as well as for specialized SRLs that will need to move away from Influx and MoFlo platforms that are approaching end of life. VLPs and submicron-sized cells (e.g., ultramicrobacteria and archaea) are found at or near the limit of detection of most flow cytometers and cell sorters. With VLPs, the small quantity of DNA recovered requires amplification before downstream sequencing. Thorough cleaning of the fluidic system and careful sample preparation are necessary both to improve detection and to prevent genomic contamination from amplifiable free DNA or microorganisms. These protocols include instructions for the preparation of sheath fluid, decontamination of the cell sorter, and removal from the fluidic system of free DNA and endotoxin that could interfere with the high-throughput amplification and sequencing of the target DNA in downstream processes. To minimize noise when sorting submicron-sized samples, clean PBS filtered with a 0.1-µm-pore-size filter is prepared, minimizing microbubbles and particulates; use of commercially available sheath fluids is not recommended, as they contain preservatives and surfactants that can affect microbial viability and are not filtered at the optimal pore size for this experimentation. In addition, detailed steps are provided for cleaning the instrument, tanks, and related media to prepare the sort, along with guidance for setting up the software, voltages, and gating strategies for successful experiments. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a key regulator of transcriptional repression and chromatin organization, essential in development and disease. While its enzymatic activity is well characterized, the factors governing PRC2 subnuclear organization, particularly in cancer cells, are largely unknown. Here, we integrate in situ subcellular proteomics, high-resolution imaging, and functional genomics to investigate PRC2 compartmentalization in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We identify PHF19, a sub-stoichiometric PRC2 accessory subunit, as upregulated in TNBC and central to the formation of endogenous, micron-scale nuclear PRC2 clusters. These structures act as spatial hubs that stabilize local PRC2 occupancy and reinforce H3K27me3 macro-domain organization. Mechanistically, an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in PHF19 is required for clustering and promoting TNBC cell motility. Our findings uncover a non-enzymatic layer of PRC2 regulation, where local PRC2 compartmentalization through accessory subunits, directly influences cellular behavior, with implications for disease and development.

DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01672

ABSTRACT:
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are critical regulators of cellular function, and their aberrant phase transitions into amyloid fibrils underlie the pathogenesis of amyloidosis. Missense mutations modulate IDR aggregation, but mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of Parkinson's disease-associated mutations (A53V and T72M) on the aggregation dynamics of α-synuclein (α-Syn), a prototype protein containing IDRs, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We focused on two disease-associated mutations, A53V and T72M, in the fibril-forming fragment (residues 42-78) of α-Syn, and we compared their aggregation behaviors with the wild-type truncated α-Syn. As demonstrated by the STM imaging, mutations remodel the coexisting conformational substates as well as the inter-β-strand interactions in the aggregates. The A53V and T72M mutations reduce the specific inter-β-strand recognitions, which are correlated with the altered aggregation kinetics. This study mechanistically explains how mutations regulate IDR aggregation through changing the conformational diversity, advancing our understanding of the molecular basis of amyloidosis.

PMID: 39058945
DOI: 10.11607/prd.7062

ABSTRACT:
Achieving initial implant stability at a molar extraction site can be challenging due to the bone width and quality, as well as anatomical limitations like the maxillary sinus and inferior alveolar nerve. The implant placement should achieve precise centralization with the interradicular septum to facilitate implant stabilization and postextraction alveolar ridge preservation/regeneration with bone grafting. Immediate nonocclusal crown placement aids peri-implant tissue maturation for the desired outcome. This retrospective series introduces guidelines for treating sockets based on alveolar septum types. The approach involves immediate dentoalveolar restoration (IDR) and osseodensification (OD) with an autogenous graft for bone preservation. A new protocol for the treatment of the molar interradicular septum during immediate implant placement and/or alveolar ridge preservation/ reconstruction was applied in 12 cases. Preoperative and postoperative CBCT examinations were performed. Socket width was measured and compared between timepoints. At the follow-up (mean: 23.58 ± 9.70 months), the mean preoperative and postoperative socket widths were 9.51 ± 0.40 mm and 11.16 ± 0.30 mm, respectively (17.35% increase; P < .05). IDR with OD is a predictable approach to treat molar sockets during implant placement.

JOURNAL: Cell reports (2025)

DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116592

ABSTRACT:
The type III secretion system (T3SS) is used by Gram-negative bacteria, including important pathogens, to manipulate eukaryotic cells by injecting effector proteins. Type III secretion and bacterial physiology are tightly interconnected. Notably, secreting cells undergo a secretion-associated growth inhibition in the T3SS model organisms Yersinia, Salmonella, and Shigella. In Yersinia, T3SS genes are encoded on the plasmid of Yersinia virulence (pYV), whose copy number increases upon induction of T3SS secretion. In this study, we characterize the link between T3SS activity and subcellular organization by localizing and quantifying pYV and chromosomal DNA in Yersinia enterocolitica. In secreting bacteria, pYV plasmids move toward the membrane and poles. We find no evidence for the transertion (coupled transcription, translation, and translocation) of a candidate effector, but we do find a striking relocation of chromosomal DNA to mid-cell. These findings reveal that T3SS activation coincides with large-scale reorganization of the bacterial nucleoid and plasmid DNA.

PMID: 40819990
DOI: 10.1016/j.pt.2025.07.012

ABSTRACT:
The pathogenesis of Toxoplasma gondii in humans is largely attributed to its capacity for rapid multiplication via a streamlined division process known as endodyogeny. The assembly of the daughter cell scaffold, occurring through a process termed budding, necessitates strict temporal and spatial regulation. Recent advances have elucidated remarkable details of the early stages of daughter cell formation, underscoring the pivotal role of the apical polar ring during the initial phases. Furthermore, emerging evidence implicates ApiAP2 transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression essential for the synthesis of daughter cell components. This transcriptional control is complemented by post-translational regulatory mechanisms governing both the initiation and maturation of the daughter cell cytoskeleton. Both processes are critical for the successful production of invasive zoites.

ABSTRACT:
Volume microscopy comprises a broad set of techniques that are indispensable in the characterization of a cell's three-dimensional architecture. In the last few decades, major technological breakthroughs in the fields of light and electron microscopy have spurred a revolution in cell biology. This trend has been accelerating in recent years as the equipment and techniques required to perform advanced microscopy are now widespread and accessible to many core facilities around the world. These powerful tools will advance the protistology field by revealing the 3D architecture of the vast majority of microbial eukaryotes that remain unexplored. In this review, we provide an overview of both historical and emerging volume microscopy technologies, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of different imaging techniques, with emphasis on how the field of protistology can make informed decisions to investigate protist form and function in three dimensions.

AUTHORS: Park SungWoo, Muroyama Andrew
JOURNAL: Journal of experimental botany (2025)
PMID: 40567129
DOI: 10.1093/jxb/eraf284

ABSTRACT:
Microtubules are crucial regulators of plant development and are organized by a suite of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that can rapidly remodel the array in response to varied cues. This complexity has inspired countless studies into microtubule function from the subcellular to tissue scale, revealing an ever-increasing number of microtubule-dependent processes. Developing a comprehensive understanding of how local microtubule configuration, dynamicity, and remodeling drive developmental progression requires new approaches to capture and alter microtubule behavior. In this review, we will introduce technological advancements that we believe are poised to transform the study of microtubules in plant cells. In particular, we focus on 1) advanced imaging and analysis methods to quantify microtubule organization and behavior and 2) novel tools to target specific microtubule populations in vivo. By showcasing innovative methodologies developed in non-plant systems, we hope to motivate their increased adoption and raise awareness of possible means of adapting them for studying microtubules in plants.

TITLE: Critical roles of plasma membrane dynamics and heterogeneity at the early stage of antigen-stimulated FcεRI signaling in mast cells.
AUTHORS: Medda Dishari, Bag Nirmalya
JOURNAL: Biochemical Society transactions (2025)
PMID: 41065380
DOI: 10.1042/BST20253073

ABSTRACT:
Stimulated transmembrane (TM) signaling mediated by plasma membrane localized receptors is central to numerous cellular processes, and their dysregulation leads to pathological conditions. Antigen (Ag) stimulated clustering of high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor FcεRI and its functional coupling of selective signaling components such as kinases, but not phosphatases, in the early stage of mast cell signaling represents the general paradigm of TM signaling mediated by membrane receptors lacking kinase module. It has been long thought that plasma membrane organizational features, especially ordered regions and cortical cytoskeletons network, play crucial roles in efficient spatial sorting of the signaling components. In this review, we highlight the observations made by advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques at high spatial and temporal resolution that essentially establish novel principles of plasma membrane 'adaptivity' in regulating the initial steps of stimulated mast cell signaling involving Ag cross-linked IgE-FcεRI receptor.

TITLE: Versatile vasculature chips for ultrasound localization microscopy.
AUTHORS: Wang Renxian, Liu Qi, Zhao Xin, Lee Wei-Ning

ABSTRACT:
Objective.Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) has revolutionized microvasculature imaging by surpassing the diffraction limit via microbubbles. While ULM demonstrates exceptional potential to resolve micron-scale vascular structures in both preclinical and clinical studies, its performance evaluation remains challenging primarily due to the lack of reference microvascular phantoms featuring realistic, micron-scale, and hierarchical vascular structures. This study thus aims to develop a fabrication protocol for microvasculature patterns that offers design versatility and enables on-demand customization.Approach.Inspired by microfluidic chip techniques, we present an organ-on-a-chip protocol for fabricating agarose-based micro-vessel network phantoms with ground truth. We experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of the vasculature phantom using two adapted patterns: (1) a leaf pattern, which exhibited intrinsic quasi-two-dimensional venation network with hierarchical and branching channels similar to animal vasculature, and (2) a kidney pattern derived from a two-dimensional projection of real human vasculature obtained via micro computed tomography. Microbubble solutions were perfused into the phantoms by capillary force and gravity.Main results.The ULM-reconstructed vasculature maps agreed well with the ground truth. ULM achieved high sensitivity values of 0.97 and 0.95, but low precision values of 0.37 and 0.60, for the leaf and kidney phantom, respectively. The results indicated the capability of ULM to reconstruct vessel structures while making many false positive predictions.Significance.The proposed protocol provides a versatile platform for creating realistic microvascular phantoms, facilitating the development, evaluation, and optimization of ultrasound microvascular imaging techniques.

TITLE: A Mouse Model of the Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy Procedure Aided by Microscopy.

PMID: 38314815
DOI: 10.3791/66098

ABSTRACT:
Hepatectomy is widely regarded as the primary treatment for hepatic malignancies; yet, postoperative liver failure remains a major cause of perioperative mortality, severely impacting patient outcomes. In a robust hepatic environment, the future liver remnant (FLR) must exceed 25%, and in cases of cirrhosis, this requirement increases to over 40%. The inadequacy of FLR is currently a major obstacle in the progression of hepatic surgery. Traditional methods to enhance FLR hypertrophy mainly focus on portal vein embolization (PVE), but its effectiveness is considerably limited. In recent years, there have been numerous reports on a novel biphasic hepatectomy method involving hepatic partitioning and portal vein ligation, known as associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS). ALPPS surpasses PVE in efficiently and considerably inducing FLR hypertrophy. However, the detailed mechanisms driving ALPPS-facilitated hepatic regeneration are not fully understood. Thus, replicating ALPPS in animal models is crucial to thoroughly investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic regeneration, offering valuable theoretical and practical insights.

ABSTRACT:
The enhanced efficiency of C4 photosynthesis, compared to the C3 mechanism, arises from its ability to concentrate CO2 in bundle sheath cells. The effectiveness of C4 photosynthesis and intrinsic water use efficiency are directly linked to the share of mesophyll and bundle leaf cells, size and density of bundle sheaths, and size, density, and cell wall thickness of bundle sheath cells. Rapid microscopical analysis of these traits can be performed on free-hand and semi-thin sections using conventional light microscopy, providing valuable information about photosynthetic efficiency in C4 crops by means of identifying and examining specific cell types. Additionally, errors in freehand and semi-thin section preparation that affect anatomical measurements and cell type diagnoses are shown, as well as how to avoid these errors. This microscopical approach offers an efficient means of gathering insights into photosynthetic acclimation to environmental variation and aids in the rapid screening of crops for future climates.

ABSTRACT:
Pulmonary macrophages exhibit a dose-dependent pattern in phagocytizing particles. Following engulfment, these macrophages are subsequently excreted with sputum, rendering macrophages and particles visible and quantifiable under light microscopy. Notably, elemental carbon within the mammalian body originates exclusively from external contaminants. Consequently, the carbon content in airway macrophages (CCAM) serves as a valid exposure biomarker, accurately estimating individual exposure to carbon-containing particulate matter (PM). This article delineates a protocol involving sputum collection, preservation, processing, slide preparation, and staining, as well as macrophage photo acquisition and analysis. After removing the macrophage nuclei, the proportion of cytoplasm area occupied by carbon particles (PCOC) was calculated to quantify carbon content in each macrophage. The results indicate an elevation in CCAM levels after exposure to carbon-containing PM. In summary, this non-invasive, precise, reliable, and standardized method enables the direct measurement of carbon particles within target cells and is utilized for large-scale quantification of individual CCAM through induced sputum.

DOI: 10.3791/66662

ABSTRACT:
Intracameral injection is a standard administration routine in ophthalmology. The application of intracameral injection in rodents for research is challenging due to the limiting dimensions and anatomy of the eye, including the small aqueous humor volume, the lens curvature, and lens thickness. Potential damage during intracameral injections introduces adverse effects and experimental variability. This protocol describes a procedure for intracameral injection in rats, allowing precision and reproducibility. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as experimental models. Since the lens position in rats protrudes into the anterior chamber, injecting from the periphery, as done in humans, is unfavorable. Therefore, an incision is created in the central corneal region using a 31 gauge 0.8 mm stiletto blade to form a self-sealing tunnel into the anterior chamber. An incision at an angle close to the flat allows to create a long tunnel, which minimizes the loss of aqueous humor and shallowing of the anterior chamber. A 34 gauge nanoneedle is inserted into the tunnel for injection. This enables penetration with minimal friction resistance and avoids touching the lens. Injection of trypan-blue allows visualization by slit microscopy the presence of the dye in the anterior chamber and exclude leakage. Bioavailability to the corneal endothelial layer is demonstrated by injection of Hoechst dye, which stained the nuclei of corneal endothelial cells after injection. In conclusion, this protocol implements a procedure for accurate intracameral injection in rats. This procedure may be used for intracameral delivery of various drugs and compounds in experimental rat models, increasing the efficiency and reproducibility of ophthalmic research.

TITLE: Fission Yeast as a Platform for Antibacterial Drug Screens Targeting Bacterial Cytoskeleton Proteins.

PMID: 38738900

ABSTRACT:
Bacterial cytoskeletal proteins such as FtsZ and MreB perform essential functions such as cell division and cell shape maintenance. Further, FtsZ and MreB have emerged as important targets for novel antimicrobial discovery. Several assays have been developed to identify compounds targeting nucleotide binding and polymerization of these cytoskeletal proteins, primarily focused on FtsZ. Moreover, many of the assays are either laborious or cost-intensive, and ascertaining whether these proteins are the cellular target of the drug often requires multiple methods. Finally, the toxicity of the drugs to eukaryotic cells also poses a problem. Here, we describe a single-step cell-based assay to discover novel molecules targeting bacterial cytoskeleton and minimize hits that might be potentially toxic to eukaryotic cells. Fission yeast is amenable to high-throughput screens based on microscopy, and a visual screen can easily identify any molecule that alters the polymerization of FtsZ or MreB. Our assay utilizes the standard 96-well plate and relies on the ability of the bacterial cytoskeletal proteins to polymerize in a eukaryotic cell such as the fission yeast. While the protocols described here are for fission yeast and utilize FtsZ from Staphylococcus aureus and MreB from Escherichia coli, they are easily adaptable to other bacterial cytoskeletal proteins that readily assemble into polymers in any eukaryotic expression hosts. The method described here should help facilitate further discovery of novel antimicrobials targeting bacterial cytoskeletal proteins.

TITLE: Harnessing the Power of MicroRNA Cargoes in Small Extracellular Vesicles Released from Fresh-Frozen Human Brain Sections.
AUTHORS: Morgan Joseph, Aarons Toby, Lace Gemma, Mukhopadhyay Arijit
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2024)
PMID: 39584691
DOI: 10.3791/67379

ABSTRACT:
Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are crucial mediators of cell-cell communication, transporting diverse cargoes like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (microRNA, mRNA, DNA). The microRNA sEV cargo has potential utility as a powerful non-invasive disease biomarker due to sEV's ability to traverse biological barriers (e.g., blood-brain barrier) and become accessible through various body fluids. Despite numerous studies on sEV biomarkers in body fluids, identifying tissue or cell-specific sEV subpopulations remains challenging, particularly from the brain. Our study addresses this challenge by adapting existing methods to isolate sEVs from minimal amounts of frozen human brain sections using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). After ethical approval, approximately 250 µg of fresh-frozen human brain tissue (obtained from Manchester Brain Bank [UK]) was sliced from the 3 donor tissues and incubated in collagenase type 3/Hibernate-E solution, with intermediate agitation, followed by serial centrifugation and filtration steps. Then, sEVs were isolated using the SEC method and characterized by following MISEV guidelines. Before isolating RNA from within these sEVs, the solution was treated with Proteinase-K and RNase-A to remove any non-sEV extracellular RNA. The RNA quantity and quality were checked and processed further for qPCR and small RNA sequencing experiments. The presence of sEVs was confirmed through fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (fNTA) and western blot for surface markers (CD9, CD63, CD81). Size distribution (50-200 nm) was confirmed by NTA and electron microscopy. The total RNA concentration within lysed sEVs ranged from 3-9 ng/µL and was used for successful quantification by qPCR for selected candidate microRNAs. Small RNA sequencing on MiSeq provided high-quality data (Q >32) with 1.4-5 million reads per sample. This method enables efficient isolation and characterization of sEVs from minimal brain tissue volumes, facilitating non-invasive biomarker research and holds promise for equitable disease biomarker studies, offering insights into neurodegenerative diseases and potentially other disorders.

ABSTRACT:
Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) infections are challenging to treat due to high intrinsic drug resistance, comparable to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Treatments are extremely ineffective and based on a multi-drug regimen, resulting in low patient compliance. Consequently, the scientific community is urged to identify new and effective drugs to treat these infections. One of the strategies employed to this end is drug repurposing - the process of identifying new therapeutic opportunities for existing drugs in the market, circumventing the time required to establish pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of new drugs. With most studies on drug development against Mab relying on traditional and time-consuming methods, an assay for high-throughput drug screening was developed against mycobacteria using an in house developed double-reporter strain of Mab. Using liquid-handling robotics, automated microscopy, and analysis, alongside in house developed double reporter strains, bacterial viability can be rapidly measured using two different readouts, luminescence and fluorescence, without adding reagents or performing any extra steps. This reduces time and variability between assays, a major advantage for high-throughput screenings. The described protocol was validated by screening a library of 1280 compounds. The obtained results were corroborated by the literature, with efficient detection of active compounds. Thus, this work fulfilled the aim of supplying the field with a new tool to help fight this extremely drug-resistant bacteria.

ABSTRACT:
The cell surface distribution patterns (clustering) of membrane proteins have been widely investigated in cell biology. Here we describe a novel transmission electron microscopic (TEM) protocol designed to improve the quality of information obtained about the protein distribution patterns detected. This novel method makes it possible to study the clustering of all transmembrane proteins on one half of the cytoplasmic membrane of a whole cell. To achieve better imaging, we combine various methods, including critical-point drying, fixation of gold beads with a carbon layer, and a newly developed chemical thinning method. In addition, in our image-processing algorithm, we implemented pair correlation and pair cross-correlation functions, providing more details and better quantitative accuracy in characterizing the size and numbers of possible protein clusters. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT:
Microplastics is recognized as an emerging pollutant and adapting and harmonizing existing test methods is essential to advancing research. The aim of our work was to provide a case study on how to ensure quality and FAIR data in the assessment of microplastic hazards with the unicellular organism Tetrahymena thermophila (Protozoa, Ciliata). We selected high density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastics as a model material. In the study design we followed the quality criteria recommended for studies on particle effects, specifically emphasizing the reporting of experimental design and data. Our experimental work was based on ISO 4988 (2022) multigeneration tests with T. thermophila that was upgraded with additional cytotoxicity tests (protocols have been made available on Zenodo). In addition, we used microscopy to inspect material-organism interaction. The results show that 24 h exposure of T. thermophila to HDPE microparticles did not induce changes in metabolic activity, viability, or proliferation up to exposure concentration 100 mg/L. Microscopy analyses confirmed ingestion of the test material but no adsorption of HDPE particles to the cell surfaces confirming that HDPE microplastics present a low hazard to T. thermophila. To maximize the impact of the generated data, we made all the produced data FAIR via the eNanoMapper repository.

ABSTRACT:
Replacement of missing or hopeless teeth in the esthetic zone is one of dentistry's most critical challenges. In the past, multiple surgical procedures have been needed to reconstruct compromised extraction sites. The surgeries have been associated with long healing times and increased morbidity, all the while patients are using either fixed or removable interim restorations. The procedures identified in this paper minimize surgical operating times, healing times, and delays in obtaining definitive restorations by combining multiple surgical procedures in one visit. The procedures are technique sensitive. This particular patient has been followed for 1 year post-operatively with clinical photographs and CBCT scans. Excellent clinical results were obtained. Benefits and limitations of the procedures have also been identified.

ABSTRACT:
Citrus uses S-RNase-based self-incompatibility to reject self-pollen and, therefore, requires nearby pollinizer trees for successful pollination and fertilization. However, identifying suitable varieties to serve as pollinizers is a time-consuming process. To solve this problem, we have developed a rapid method for identifying pollination-compatible citrus cultivars that utilizes agarose gel electrophoresis and aniline blue staining. Pollen compatibility is determined based on the identification of S genotypes by extracting total DNA and performing PCR-based genotyping assays with specific primers. Additionally, styles are collected 3-4 days after manual pollination, and aniline blue staining is performed. Finally, the growth status of the pollen tubes is observed with a fluorescence microscope. Pollen compatibility and incompatibility can be established by observing whether the pollen tube growth is normal or suppressed, respectively. Due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, this method is an effective tool for determining the pollen compatibility and incompatibility of different citrus varieties to establish incompatibility groups and incompatibility relationships between different cultivars. This method provides information essential for the successful selection of suitable pollinizer trees and, thus, facilitates the establishment of new orchards and the selection of appropriate parents for breeding programs.

TITLE: Formulation and Characterization of Bioactive Agent Containing Nanodisks.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2023)
PMID: 37010309
DOI: 10.3791/65145

ABSTRACT:
The term nanodisk refers to a discrete type of nanoparticle comprised of a bilayer forming lipid, a scaffold protein, and an integrated bioactive agent. Nanodisks are organized as a disk-shaped lipid bilayer whose perimeter is circumscribed by the scaffold protein, usually a member of the exchangeable apolipoprotein family. Numerous hydrophobic bioactive agents have been efficiently solubilized in nanodisks by their integration into the hydrophobic milieu of the particle's lipid bilayer, yielding a largely homogenous population of particles in the range of 10-20 nm in diameter. The formulation of nanodisks requires a precise ratio of individual components, an appropriate sequential addition of each component, followed by bath sonication of the formulation mixture. The amphipathic scaffold protein spontaneously contacts and reorganizes the dispersed bilayer forming lipid/bioactive agent mixture to form a discrete, homogeneous population of nanodisk particles. During this process, the reaction mixture transitions from an opaque, turbid appearance to a clarified sample that, when fully optimized, yields no precipitate upon centrifugation. Characterization studies involve the determination of bioactive agent solubilization efficiency, electron microscopy, gel filtration chromatography, ultraviolet visible (UV/Vis) absorbance spectroscopy, and/or fluorescence spectroscopy. This is normally followed by an investigation of biological activity using cultured cells or mice. In the case of nanodisks harboring an antibiotic (i.e., the macrolide polyene antibiotic amphotericin B), their ability to inhibit the growth of yeast or fungi as a function of concentration or time can be measured. The relative ease of formulation, versatility with respect to component parts, nanoscale particle size, inherent stability, and aqueous solubility permits myriad in vitro and in vivo applications of nanodisk technology. In the present article, we describe a general methodology to formulate and characterize nanodisks containing amphotericin B as the hydrophobic bioactive agent.

ABSTRACT:
High-resolution in vivo microscopy approaches can reveal subtle information and fine details inside the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), but require strong animal immobilization to prevent motion blur in the images. Unfortunately, most current immobilization techniques require substantial manual effort, rendering high-resolution imaging low-throughput. Immobilization of C. elegans is greatly simplified by using a cooling approach that can easily immobilize entire populations directly on their cultivation plates. The cooling stage can establish and maintain a wide range of temperatures with a uniform distribution on the cultivation plate. In this article, the whole process of building the cooling stage is documented. The aim is that a typical researcher can build an operational cooling stage in their laboratory following this protocol without difficulty. Utilization of the cooling stage following three protocols is shown, and each protocol has advantages for different experiments. Also shown is an example cooling profile of the stage as it approaches its final temperature and some helpful tips in using cooling immobilization.

ABSTRACT:
Beneficial and probiotic bacteria play essential roles in their hosts, providing various health benefits, including immunity to infectious diseases. The Lactobacillaceae family consists of Gram-positive bacteria with confirmed probiotic properties. This study utilizes Lactobacillaceae species as a model to demonstrate the effectiveness of single-cell high throughput analysis in studying cellular aggregation. The focus is on analyzing the response of these beneficial species to simple carbohydrates from the diet. The study showcases how Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) can overcome the fundamental differences in the assembly of probiotic bacteria in the presence and absence of carbohydrates. IFC combines the power and speed of conventional flow cytometry with the spatial resolution of microscopy, enabling high-rate complex morphometric measurements in a phenotypically defined manner across a library of beneficial bacterial strains and conditions. This protocol provides insights into the autoaggregation of Lactobacillaceae species and sheds light on their response to dietary carbohydrates, contributing to understanding the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of these probiotic bacteria.

PMID: 36847385
DOI: 10.3791/64978

ABSTRACT:
Because of their designability and unprecedented synergistic effects, core-shell metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been actively examined recently. However, the synthesis of single-crystalline core-shell MOFs is very challenging, and thus a limited number of examples have been reported. Here, we suggest a method of synthesizing single-crystalline HKUST-1@MOF-5 core-shells, which is HKUST-1 at the center of MOF-5. Through the computational algorithm, this pair of MOFs was predicted to have the matched lattice parameters and chemical connection points at the interface. To construct the core-shell structure, we prepared the octahedral- and cubic-shaped HKUST-1 crystals as a core MOF, in which the (111) and (001) facets were mainly exposed, respectively. Via the sequential reaction, the MOF-5 shell was well-grown on the exposed surface, showing a seamless connect interface, which resulted in the successful synthesis of single-crystalline HKUST-1@MOF-5. Their pure phase formation was proved by optical microscopic images and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns. This method presents the potential of and insights into the single-crystalline core-shell synthesis with different kinds of MOFs.

ABSTRACT:
Dry eye is a multi-factorial disease affecting ocular surface health, with a profoundly higher prevalence in women. Disruption of the gel-forming mucin that is secreted by conjunctival goblet cells (CGCs) onto the ocular surface contributes to multiple ocular surface diseases. The elimination of exogenous sex hormones is essential to obtain consistent results during in vitro study of sex-based differences in CGCs. This paper describes a method to minimize the presence of exogenous hormones in the study of sex-based differences in CGCs while maintaining their physiological function. CGCs from postmortem human donors of both sexes were cultured from pieces of the conjunctiva in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (referred to as the complete medium) until confluency. Nearly 48 h before the start of the experiments, CGCs were transferred to RPMI medium without phenol red or FBS but with 1% BSA (referred to as phenol-red-free medium). The normal cellular function was studied by measuring the increase in intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) after carbachol (Cch, 1 x 10-4 M) stimulation using fura 2/acetoxymethyl (AM) microscopy. The result shows that CGCs maintained normal function in the phenol-red-free media after 48 h. No significant difference in [Ca2+]i response was observed between phenol red-free RPMI medium and complete medium upon Cch stimulation. Therefore, we recommend using the phenol-red free RPMI medium with 1% BSA to eliminate exogenous hormones without altering the normal function of CGCs in the study of sex-based differences.

ABSTRACT:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to a range of cell biological processes that cause midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron loss. Many current in vitro PD cellular models lack complexity and do not take multiple phenotypes into account. Phenotypic profiling in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mDA neurons can address these shortcomings by simultaneously measuring a range of neuronal phenotypes in a PD-relevant cell type in parallel. Here, we describe a protocol to obtain and analyze phenotypic profiles from commercially available human mDA neurons. A neuron-specific fluorescent staining panel is used to visualize the nuclear, α-synuclein, Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) related phenotypes. The described phenotypic profiling protocol is scalable as it uses 384-well plates, automatic liquid handling and high-throughput microscopy. The utility of the protocol is exemplified using healthy donor mDA neurons and mDA neurons carrying the PD-linked G2019S mutation in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene. Both cell lines were treated with the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor PFE-360 and phenotypic changes were measured. Additionally, we demonstrate how multidimensional phenotypic profiles can be analyzed using clustering or machine learning-driven supervised classification methods. The described protocol will particularly interest researchers working on neuronal disease modeling or studying chemical compound effects in human neurons.

TITLE: Analysis of Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance in C. elegans Using a Fluorescent Reporter and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP).

ABSTRACT:
Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) allows the transmission of information through the germline without changing the genome sequence, through factors such as non-coding RNAs and chromatin modifications. The phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) inheritance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an effective model to investigate TEI that takes advantage of this model organism's short life cycle, self-propagation, and transparency. In RNAi inheritance, exposure of animals to RNAi leads to gene silencing and altered chromatin signatures at the target locus that persist for multiple generations in the absence of the initial trigger. This protocol describes the analysis of RNAi inheritance in C. elegans using a germline-expressed nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Reporter silencing is initiated by feeding the animals bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA targeting GFP. At each generation, animals are passaged to maintain synchronized development, and reporter gene silencing is determined by microscopy. At select generations, populations are collected and processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to measure histone modification enrichment at the GFP reporter locus. This protocol for studying RNAi inheritance can be easily modified and combined with other analyses to further investigate TEI factors in small RNA and chromatin pathways.

ABSTRACT:
Self-assembly is a simple yet reliable method for constructing nanoscale drug delivery systems. Photoactivatable prodrugs enable controllable drug release from nanocarriers at target sites modulated by light irradiation. In this protocol, a facile method for fabricating photoactivatable prodrug-dye nanoparticles via molecular self-assembly is presented. The procedures for prodrug synthesis, nanoparticle fabrication, physical characterization of the nanoassembly, photocleavage demonstration, and in vitro cytotoxicity verification are described in detail. A photocleavable boron-dipyrromethene-chlorambucil (BC) prodrug was first synthesized. BC and a near-infrared dye, IR-783, at an optimized ratio, could self-assemble into nanoparticles (IR783/BC NPs). The synthesized nanoparticles had an average size of 87.22 nm and a surface charge of -29.8 mV. The nanoparticles disassembled upon light irradiation, which could be observed by transmission electronic microscopy. The photocleavage of BC was completed within 10 min, with a 22% recovery efficiency for chlorambucil. The nanoparticles displayed enhanced cytotoxicity under light irradiation at 530 nm compared with the non-irradiated nanoparticles and irradiated free BC prodrug. This protocol provides a reference for the construction and evaluation of photoresponsive drug delivery systems.

ABSTRACT:
The classical analyses of indirect communication between different cell types necessitate the use of conditioned media. Moreover, the production of conditioned media remains time-consuming and far from physiological and pathological conditions. Although a few models of co-culture are commercially available, they remain restricted to specific assays and are mostly for two types of cells. Here, 3D-printed inserts are used that are compatible with numerous functional assays. The insert allows the separation of one well of a 6-well plate into four compartments. A wide range of combinations can be set. Moreover, windows are designed in each wall of the compartments so that potential intercellular communication between every compartment is possible in the culture medium in a volume-dependent manner. For example, paracrine intercellular communication can be studied between four cell types in monolayer, in 3D (spheroids), or by combining both. In addition, a mix of different cell types can be seeded in the same compartment in 2D or 3D (organoids) format. The absence of a bottom in the 3D-printed inserts allows the usual culture conditions on the plate, possible coating on the plate containing the insert, and direct visualization by optical microscopy. The multiple compartments provide the possibility to collect different cell types independently or to use, in each compartment, different reagents for RNA or protein extraction. In this study, a detailed methodology is provided to use the new 3D-printed insert as a co-culture system. To demonstrate several capacities of this flexible and simple model, previously published functional assays of cell communication were performed in the new 3D-printed inserts and were demonstrated to be reproducible. The 3D-printed inserts and the conventional cell culture using conditioned media led to similar results. In conclusion, the 3D-printed insert is a simple device that can be adapted to numerous models of co-cultures with adherent cell types.

ABSTRACT:
Traction force microscopy (TFM) is the main method used in mechanobiology to measure cell forces. Commonly this is being used for cells adhering to flat soft substrates that deform under cell traction (2D-TFM). TFM relies on the use of linear elastic materials, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or polyacrylamide (PA). For 2D-TFM on PA, the difficulty in achieving high throughput results mainly from the large variability of cell shapes and tractions, calling for standardization. We present a protocol to rapidly and efficiently fabricate micropatterned PA hydrogels for 2D-TFM studies. The micropatterns are first created by maskless photolithography using near-UV light where extracellular matrix proteins bind only to the micropatterned regions, while the rest of the surface remains non-adhesive for cells. The micropatterning of extracellular matrix proteins is due to the presence of active aldehyde groups, resulting in adhesive regions of different shapes to accommodate either single cells or groups of cells. For TFM measurements, we use PA hydrogels of different elasticity by varying the amounts of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide and tracking the displacement of embedded fluorescent beads to reconstruct cell traction fields with regularized Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry (FTTC). To further achieve precise recording of cell forces, we describe the use of a controlled dose of patterned light to release cell tractions in defined regions for single cells or groups of cells. We call this method local UV illumination traction force microscopy (LUVI-TFM). With enzymatic treatment, all cells are detached from the sample simultaneously, whereas with LUVI-TFM traction forces of cells in different regions of the sample can be recorded in sequence. We demonstrate the applicability of this protocol (i) to study cell traction forces as a function of controlled adhesion to the substrate, and (ii) to achieve a greater number of experimental observations from the same sample.

ABSTRACT:
Recycling endosomes (REs) are tubular-vesicular organelles generated from early/sorting endosomes in all cell types. These organelles play a key role in the biogenesis of melanosomes, a lysosome-related organelle produced by melanocytes. REs deliver the melanocyte-specific cargo to premature melanosomes during their formation. Blockage in the generation of REs, observed in several mutants of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, results in hypopigmentation of skin, hair, and eye. Therefore, studying the dynamics (refer to number and length) of REs is useful to understand the function of these organelles in normal and disease conditions. In this study, we aim to measure the RE dynamics using a resident SNARE STX13.

ABSTRACT:
Compared to bulk scaffolds and direct injection of cells alone, the injectable modular units have garnered enormous interest in repairing malfunctioned tissues due to convenience in the packaging of cells, improved cell retention, and minimal invasiveness. Moreover, the porous conformation of these microscale carriers could enhance the medium exchange and improve the level of nutrients and oxygen supplies. The present study illustrates the convenient fabrication of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-based highly open porous microspheres (PLGA-HOPMs) by the facile microfluidic technology for cell delivery applications. The resultant monodispersed PLGA-HOPMs possessed particle sizes of ~400 µm and open pores of ~50 µm with interconnecting windows. Briefly, the emulsified oil droplets (PLGA solution in dichloromethane, DCM), wrapped with the 7.5% (w/v) gelatin aqueous phase, were introduced into the 1% (w/v) continuous flowing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) aqueous solution through the coaxial nozzle in the customized microfluidic setup. Subsequently, the microspheres were subjected to solvent extraction and lyophilization procedures, resulting in the production of HOPMs. Notably, various formulations (concentrations of PLGA and porogen) and processing parameters (emulsifying power, needle gauge, and flow rate of dispersed phase) play crucial roles in the qualities and characteristics of the resulting PLGA HOPMs. Moreover, these architectures might potentially encapsulate various other biochemical cues, such as growth factors, for extended drug discovery and tissue regeneration applications.

TITLE: Pattern Generation for Micropattern Traction Microscopy.

JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2022)
PMID: 35253805
DOI: 10.3791/63628

ABSTRACT:
Micropattern traction microscopy allows control of the shape of single cells and cell clusters. Furthermore, the ability to pattern at the micrometer length scale allows the use of these patterned contact zones for the measurement of traction forces, as each micropatterned dot allows for the formation of a single focal adhesion that then deforms the soft, underlying hydrogel. This approach has been used for a wide range of cell types, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, platelets, and epithelial cells. This review describes the evolution of techniques that allow the printing of extracellular matrix proteins onto polyacrylamide hydrogels in a regular array of dots of prespecified size and spacing. As micrometer-scale patterns are difficult to directly print onto soft substrates, patterns are first generated on rigid glass coverslips that are then used to transfer the pattern to the hydrogel during gelation. First, the original microcontact printing approach to generate arrays of small dots on the coverslip is described. A second step that removes most of the pattern to leave islands of small dots is required to control the shapes of cells and cell clusters on such arrays of patterned dots. Next, an evolution of this approach that allows for the generation of islands of dots using a single subtractive patterning step is described. This approach is greatly simplified for the user but has the disadvantage of a decreased lifetime for the master mold needed to make the patterns. Finally, the computational approaches that have been developed for the analysis of images of displaced dots and subsequent cell-generated traction fields are described, and updated versions of these analysis packages are provided.

PMID: 36622011
DOI: 10.3791/64281

ABSTRACT:
During embryogenesis, coordinated cell movement generates mechanical forces that regulate gene expression and activity. To study this process, tools such as aspiration or coverslip compression have been used to mechanically stimulate whole embryos. These approaches limit experimental design as they are imprecise, require manual handling, and can process only a couple of embryos simultaneously. Microfluidic systems have great potential for automating such experimental tasks while increasing throughput and precision. This article describes a microfluidic system developed to precisely compress whole Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryos. This system features microchannels with pneumatically actuated deformable sidewalls and enables embryo alignment, immobilization, compression, and post-stimulation collection. By parallelizing these microchannels into seven lanes, steady or dynamic compression patterns can be applied to hundreds of Drosophila embryos simultaneously. Fabricating this system on a glass coverslip facilitates the simultaneous mechanical stimulation and imaging of samples with high-resolution microscopes. Moreover, the utilization of biocompatible materials, like PDMS, and the ability to flow fluid through the system make this device capable of long-term experiments with media-dependent samples. This approach also eliminates the requirement for manual mounting which mechanically stresses samples. Furthermore, the ability to quickly collect samples from the microchannels enables post-stimulation analyses, including -omics assays which require large sample numbers unattainable using traditional mechanical stimulation approaches. The geometry of this system is readily scalable to different biological systems, enabling numerous fields to benefit from the functional features described herein including high sample throughput, mechanical stimulation or immobilization, and automated alignment.

ABSTRACT:
The development of novel imaging techniques of molecular and colloidal transport, including nanoparticles, is an area of active investigation in microfluidic and millifluidic studies. With the advent of three-dimensional (3D) printing, a new domain of materials has emerged, thereby increasing the demand for novel polymers. Specifically, polymeric powders, with average particle sizes on the order of a micron, are experiencing a growing interest from academic and industrial communities. Controlling material tunability at the mesoscopic to microscopic length scales creates opportunities to develop innovative materials, such as gradient materials. Recently, a need for micron-sized polymeric powders has been growing, as clear applications for the material are developing. Three-dimensional printing provides a high-throughput process with a direct link to new applications, driving investigations into the physio-chemical and transport interactions on a mesoscale. The protocol that is discussed in this article provides a non-invasive technique to image fluid flow in packed powder beds, providing high temporal and spatial resolution while leveraging mobile technology that is readily available from mobile devices, such as smartphones. By utilizing a common mobile device, the imaging costs that would normally be associated with an optical microscope are eliminated, resulting in a frugal-science approach. The proposed protocol has successfully characterized a variety of combinations of fluids and powders, creating a diagnostic platform for quickly imaging and identifying an optimal combination of fluid and powder.

ABSTRACT:
Zebrafish exhibit remarkable life-long growth and regenerative abilities. For example, specialized stem cell niches established during embryogenesis support continuous growth of the entire visual system, both in the eye and the brain. Coordinated growth between the retinae and the optic tectum ensures accurate retinotopic mapping as new neurons are added in the eyes and brain. To address whether retinal axons provide crucial information for regulating tectal stem and progenitor cell behaviors such as survival, proliferation, and/or differentiation, it is necessary to be able to compare innervated and denervated tectal lobes within the same animal and across animals. Surgical removal of one eye from living larval zebrafish followed by observation of the optic tectum achieves this goal. The accompanying video demonstrates how to anesthetize larvae, electrolytically sharpen tungsten needles, and use them to remove one eye. It next shows how to dissect brains from fixed zebrafish larvae. Finally, the video provides an overview of the protocol for immunohistochemistry and a demonstration of how to mount stained embryos in low-melting-point agarose for microscopy.

ABSTRACT:
Eukaryotic DNA replication is a highly regulated process that ensures that the genetic blueprint of a cell is correctly duplicated prior to chromosome segregation. As DNA synthesis defects underlie chromosome rearrangements, monitoring DNA replication has become essential to understand the basis of genome instability. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a classical model to study cell cycle regulation, but key DNA replication parameters, such as the fraction of cells in the S phase or the S-phase duration, are still difficult to determine. This protocol uses short and non-toxic pulses of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), a thymidine analog, in engineered TK-hENT1 yeast cells, followed by its detection by Click reaction to allow the visualization and quantification of DNA replication with high spatial and temporal resolution at both the single-cell and population levels by microscopy and flow cytometry. This method may identify previously overlooked defects in the S phase and cell cycle progression of yeast mutants, thereby allowing the characterization of new players essential for ensuring genome stability.

ABSTRACT:
Membrane protein interactions are challenging to identify because of the unique biophysical characteristics of both transmembrane proteins and membrane environments. The Receptor Display in Membranes Interaction Screen (RDIMIS) platform overcomes these challenges by screening transmembrane and membrane-proximal proteins in a membrane environment using recombinant extracellular vesicles (rEVs). The screen has been used to successfully identify interactions for difficult-to-study receptors in an unbiased manner. In this report, we detail how we generate rEVs, characterize the rEVs to ensure screen-readiness, and perform the full interaction screening, with emphasis on the criteria necessary to obtain clear, interpretable results. We also include support protocols for generating a screening library and validating screening results, as well as an alternate protocol for RDIMIS enabling the profiling of naturally occurring extracellular vesicles. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT:
Objective: To investigate the feasibility of reducing the iodine delivery rate (IDR) of coronary CT angiography(CCTA)with 100 kVp to 60% of 120 kVp standard. Methods: A total of 205 patients (105 males and 100 females, aged from 23 to 87 years) underwent CCTA due to suspected coronary artery disease in Department of Radiology of Peking University Third Hospital from February to July 2022 were enrolled. Those patients were divided into five subgroups according to their body weight: <50 kg, 50 to 59 kg, 60 to 69 kg, 70 to 79 kg and ≥ 80 kg, respectively. All the cases were scanned with 100 kVp tube voltage and combined with mixed iterative reconstruction technology KARL 3D. The IDR injection protocol was set to 60% of the 120 kVp IDR standard (10% lower than the guideline), and the IDR of each group was 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 gI/s, respectively. The CT attenuations (CT value) and noise (SD value) of the aortic root, proximal left anterior descending branch and the distal segments of the right coronary artery, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast noise ratio (CNR) of proximal left anterior descending branch and the distal segments of the right coronary artery, the whole subjective image quality scores of the coronary artery, and effective dose (ED) of CCTA in the five groups were compared. The One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-walls test was used for statistical analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in CT attenuations and noise of aortic root, proximal left anterior descending and the distal segments of the right coronary artery, SNR and CNR of proximal left anterior descending branch and the distal segments of the right coronary artery, and subjective image quality scores among the five groups (all P>0.05). The difference of the dosage of contrast medium and ED among the five groups were statistically significant (all P<0.05). The dosage of contrast medium in the five groups were 30, 34, 38, 43 and 48 ml, and the ED in the five groups was 2.24 (1.88, 2.56), 2.62 (2.24, 3.17), 2.70 (2.48, 3.20), 4.13 (3.85, 4.40) and 4.44 (4.01, 5.02) mSv, respectively. Conclusion: It is feasible to reduce the IDR injection protocol of coronary CT angiography with 100 kVp to 60% of the standard injection protocol with 120 kVp, which is worthy of promotion. 目的： 探讨冠状动脉CT血管成像（CCTA）100 kVp碘流率降低至120 kVp水平60%的可行性。 方法： 纳入2022年2至7月于北京大学第三医院放射科因临床怀疑冠心病行CCTA检查的受检者205例，其中男105例，女100例，年龄23~87（60±13）岁。根据受检者体重分成5组，分别为<50 kg、50~59 kg、60~69 kg、70~79 kg、≥80 kg。所有病例均采用100 kVp管电压扫描并联合混合迭代重建技术（KARL 3D）重建，碘流率注射方案设置为120 kVp碘流率标准的60%（在指南基础上降低了10%），各组碘流率分别为0.9、1.0、1.1、1.3及1.4 gI/s。比较5组受检者CCTA的主动脉根部、左前降支近段及右冠状动脉远段管腔的CT值及噪声（SD值），左前降支及右冠状动脉信噪比（SNR）和对比噪声比（CNR），冠状动脉主观评分及有效辐射剂量（ED）差异。采用单因素方差分析或秩和检验分析以上指标的组间统计学差异。 结果： 5组主动脉根部、左前降支近段及右冠状动脉远段管腔CT值及SD值，左前降支近段及右冠状动脉远段管腔SNR和CNR，以及冠状动脉主观评分，差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。5组间CCTA检查对比剂用量和ED差异均有统计学意义（均P<0.05），对比剂用量分别为30、34、38、43及48 ml，ED［M（Q1，Q3）］分别为2.24（1.88，2.56）、2.62（2.24，3.17）、2.70（2.48，3.20）、4.13（3.85，4.40）及4.44（4.01，5.02）mSv。 结论： CCTA100 kVp碘流率注射方案降低至120 kVp碘流率的60%具有可行性，值得推广。.

This project aims to develop an easy-to-use and cost-effective platform for the fabrication of precise, multilayer microfluidic devices, which typically can only be achieved using costly equipment in a clean room setting. The key part of the platform is a three dimensionally (3D) printed microscope mask alignment adapter (MMAA) compatible with regular optical microscopes and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure systems. The overall process of creating the device has been vastly simplified because of the work done to optimize the device design. The process entails finding the proper dimensions for the equipment available in the laboratory and 3D-printing the MMAA with the optimized specifications. Experimental results show that the optimized MMAA designed and manufactured by 3D printing performs well with a common microscope and light exposure system. Using a master mold prepared by the 3D-printed MMAA, the resulting microfluidic devices with multilayered structures contain alignment errors of <10 µm, which is sufficient for common microchips. Although human error through transportation of the device to the UV light exposure system can cause larger fabrication errors, the minimal errors achieved in this study are attainable with practice and care. Furthermore, the MMAA can be customized to fit any microscope and UV exposure system by making changes to the modeling file in the 3D printing system. This project provides smaller laboratories with a useful research tool as it only requires the use of equipment that is typically already available to laboratories that produce and use microfluidic devices. The following detailed protocol outlines the design and 3D printing process for the MMAA. In addition, the steps for procuring a multilayer master mold using the MMAA and producing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic chips is also described herein.

ABSTRACT:
Drosophila melanogaster is a very powerful model in biological research, but a bad model for photography or videography. This paper describes a simple but effective method to observe and document the behavior or morphology of flies. Flies were placed in a translucent observation chamber c.a. Ø15 x 5mm (no food inside) or Ø15 x 12 mm (with an 8 mm-high piece of food inside). After covering with an ultraviolet (UV)/clear filter with high light transmittance, the chamber was placed under a 5-50x zoom stereo microscope, and mini light-emitting diode (LED) video lights were placed on both sides of the microscope to illuminate the chamber to obtain uniform, soft, bright, and nearly shadow-free light. Then, a compact digital camera with 3-5x optical zoom, which can record 1080 P high-definition or higher resolution video (at a frame rate of ≥30 fps), was connected to the eyepiece of microscope through a bracket, and photographs or videos were taken through the eyepiece. By adjusting the zoom knob of the zoom stereo microscope, it was very easy to track the flies and take panoramic or detailed close-up images as needed, while the camera recorded everything under the microscope. Because the flies can stay at any position in the chamber, they can be observed and recorded from all directions. The photographs or videos taken are of good image quality. This method can be used both for scientific research and teaching.

TITLE: Quantitative Atomic-Site Analysis of Functional Dopants/Point Defects in Crystalline Materials by Electron-Channeling-Enhanced Microanalysis.

ABSTRACT:
A novel elemental and chemical analysis scheme based on electron-channeling phenomena in crystalline materials is introduced, where the incident high-energy electron beam is rocked with the submicrometric pivot point fixed on a specimen. This method enables us to quantitatively derive the site occupancies and site-dependent chemical information of impurities or intentionally doped functional elements in a specimen, using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy attached to a scanning transmission electron microscope, which is of significant interest to current materials science, particularly related to nanotechnologies. This scheme is applicable to any combination of elements even when the conventional Rietveld analysis by X-ray or neutron diffraction occasionally fails to provide the desired results because of limited sample sizes and close scattering factors of neighboring elements in the periodic table. In this methodological article, we demonstrate the basic experimental procedure and analysis method of the present beam-rocking microanalysis.

ABSTRACT:
This article describes the methods of measuring the toxicity of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ocular toxins on primary (pHCEC) and immortalized (iHCEC) human corneal epithelial cell cultures. Cells were exposed to UV radiation and toxic doses of benzalkonium chloride (BAK), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Metabolic activity was measured using a metabolic assay. The release of inflammatory cytokines was measured using a multi-plex interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) assay, and cells were evaluated for viability using fluorescent dyes. The damaging effects of UV on cell metabolic activity and cytokine release occurred at 5 min of UV exposure for iHCEC and 20 min for pHCEC. Similar percent drops in metabolic activity of the iHCEC and pHCEC occurred after exposure to BAK, H2O2, or SDS, and the most significant changes in cytokine release occurred for IL-6 and IL-8. Microscopy of fluorescently stained iHCEC and pHCEC BAK-exposed cells showed cell death at 0.005% BAK exposure, although the degree of ethidium staining was greater in the iHCECs than pHCECs. Utilizing multiple methods of assessing toxic effects using microscopy, assessments of metabolic activity, and cytokine production, the toxicity of UV radiation and chemical toxins could be determined for both primary and immortalized cell lines.

ABSTRACT:
Mouse model systems are unmatched for the analysis of disease processes because of their genetic manipulability and the low cost of experimental treatments. However, because of their small body size, some structures, such as the oviduct with a diameter of 200-400 μm, have proven to be relatively difficult to study except by immunohistochemistry. Recently, immunohistochemical studies have uncovered more complex differences in oviduct segments than were previously recognized; thus, the oviduct is divided into four functional segments with different ratios of seven distinct epithelial cell types. The different embryological origins and ratios of the epithelial cell types likely make the four functional regions differentially susceptible to disease. For example, precursor lesions to serous intraepithelial carcinomas arise from the infundibulum in mouse models and from the corresponding fimbrial region in the human fallopian tube. The protocol described here details a method for microdissection to subdivide the oviduct in such a way to yield a sufficient amount and purity of RNA necessary for downstream analysis such as reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Also described is a mostly non-enzymatic tissue dissociation method appropriate for flow cytometry or single cell RNAseq analysis of fully differentiated oviductal cells. The methods described will facilitate further research utilizing the murine oviduct in the field of reproduction, fertility, cancer, and immunology.

ABSTRACT:
Cultures of dissociated hippocampal neuronal and glial cells are a valuable experimental model for studying neural growth and function by providing high cell isolation and a controlled environment. However, the survival of hippocampal cells in vitro is compromised: most cells die during the first week of culture. It is therefore of great importance to identify ways to increase the durability of neural cells in culture. Calcium carbonate in the form of crystalline aragonite derived from the skeleton of corals can be used as a superior, active matrix for neural cultures. By nurturing, protecting, and activating glial cells, the coral skeleton enhances the survival and growth of these cells in vitro better than other matrices. This protocol describes a method for cultivating hippocampal cells on a coralline matrix. This matrix is generated by attaching grains of coral skeletons to culture dishes, flasks, and glass coverslips. The grains assist in improving the environment of the cells by introducing them to a fine three-dimensional (3D) environment to grow on and to form tissue-like structures. The 3D environment introduced by the coral skeleton can be optimized for the cells by grinding, which enables control over the size and density of the grains (i.e., the matrix roughness), a property that has been found to influence glial cells activity. Moreover, the use of grains makes the observation and analysis of the cultures easier, especially when using light microscopy. Hence, the protocol includes procedures for generation and optimization of the coralline matrix as a tool to improve the maintenance and functionality of neural cells in vitro.

TITLE: Localized Bathless Metal-Composite Plating via Electrostamping.
AUTHORS: Townsend Troy K, Hancock Juliana, Russell Carter, Shaw Jason P
JOURNAL: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE (2020)
PMID: 33044463
DOI: 10.3791/61484

ABSTRACT:
Composite plating with particles embedded into the metal matrix can enhance the properties of the metal coating to make it more or less conductive, hard, durable, lubricated or fluorescent. However, it can be more challenging than metal plating, because the composite particles are either 1) not charged so they do not have a strong electrostatic attraction to the cathode, 2) are hygroscopic and are blocked by a hydration shell, or 3) too large to remain stagnate at the cathode while stirring. Here, we describe the details of a bathless plating method that involves anode and cathode nickel plates sandwiching an aqueous concentrated electrolyte paste containing large hygroscopic phosphorescent particles and a hydrophilic membrane. After applying a potential, the nickel metal is deposited around the stagnant phosphor particles, trapping them in the film. The composite coatings are characterized by optical microscopy for film roughness, thickness and composite surface loading. In addition, fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to quantify the illumination brightness of these films to assess the effects of various current densities, coating duration and phosphor loading.

ABSTRACT:
Tumor-draining lymph nodes (LNs) are not merely filters of tumor-produced waste. They are one of the most common regional sites of provisional residence of disseminated tumor cells in patients with different types of cancer. The detection of these LN-residing tumor cells is an important biomarker associated with poor prognosis and adjuvant therapy decisions. Recent mouse models have indicated that LN-residing tumor cells could be a substantial source of malignant cells for distant metastases. The ability to quantify the adhesivity of tumor cells to LN parenchyma is a critical gauge in experimental research that focuses on the identification of genes or signaling pathways relevant for lymphatic/metastatic dissemination. Because LNs are complex 3D structures with a variety of appearances and compositions in tissue sections depending on the plane of section, their matrices are difficult to replicate experimentally in vitro in a fully controlled way. Here, we describe a simple and inexpensive method that allows the quantification of adhesive tumor cells to LN cryosections. Using serial sections of the same LN, we adapt the classic method developed by Brodt to use nonradioactive labels and directly count the number of adhering tumor cells per LN surface area. LN-adherent tumor cells are readily identified by light microscopy and confirmed by a fluorescence-based method, giving an adhesion index that reveals the cell-binding affinity to LN parenchyma, which is suggestive evidence of molecular alterations in the affinity binding of integrins to their correlate LN-ligands.

ABSTRACT:
Studying isolated cells from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) allows understanding of immune cells response in pathologies involving mucosal immunity, because they can model host-pathogen interactions in the tissue. While isolated cells derived from tissues were the first cell culture model, their use has been neglected because tissue can be hard to obtain. In the present protocol, we explain how to easily process and culture tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMCs) from healthy human tonsils to study innate immune responses upon activation, mimicking viral infection in mucosal tissues. Isolation of TMCs from the tonsils is quick, because the tonsils barely have any epithelium and yield up to billions of all major immune cell types. This method allows detection of cytokine production using several techniques, including immunoassays, qPCR, microscopy, flow cytometry, etc., similar to the use of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from blood. Furthermore, TMCs show a higher sensitivity to drug testing than PBMCs, which needs to be considered for future toxicity assays. Thus, ex vivo TMCs cultures are an easy and accessible mucosal model.

ABSTRACT:
Tumorigenesis is a multi-step process in which cells acquire capabilities that allow their growth, survival, and dissemination under hostile conditions. Different tests seek to identify and quantify these hallmarks of cancerous cells; however, they often focus on a single aspect of cellular transformation and, in fact, multiple tests are required for their proper characterization. The purpose of this work is to provide researchers with a set of tools to assess cellular transformation in vitro from a broad perspective, thereby making it possible to draw sound conclusions. A sustained proliferative signaling activation is the major feature of tumoral tissues and can be easily monitored under in vitro conditions by calculating the number of population doublings achieved over time. Besides, the growth of cells in 3D cultures allows their interaction with surrounding cells, resembling what occurs in vivo. This enables the evaluation of cellular aggregation and, together with immunofluorescent labeling of distinctive cellular markers, to obtain information on another relevant feature of tumoral transformation: the loss of proper organization. Another remarkable characteristic of transformed cells is their capacity to grow without attachment to other cells and to the extracellular matrix, which can be evaluated with the anchorage assay. Detailed experimental procedures to evaluate cell growth rate, to perform immunofluorescent labeling of cell lineage markers in 3D cultures, and to test anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar are provided. These methodologies are optimized for Breast Primary Epithelial Cells (BPEC) due to its relevance in breast cancer; however, procedures can be applied to other cell types after some adjustments.

ABSTRACT:
Primaquine (PMQ), an important anti-malarial drug, has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by P. vivax and ovale. However, PMQ has unwanted adverse effects that lead to acute hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. There is a need to develop simple and reliable methods for PMQ determination with the purpose of dosage monitoring. In early 2019, we have reported an UV-Vis and naked-eye based approach for PMQ colorimetric quantification. The detection was based on a Griess-like reaction between PMQ and anilines, which can generate colored azo products. The detection limit for direct measurement of PMQ in synthetic urine is in the nanomolar range. Moreover, this method has shown great potential for PMQ quantification from human serum samples at clinically relevant concentrations. In this protocol, we will describe the technical details regarding the syntheses and characterization of colored azo products, the reagent preparation, and the procedures for PMQ determination.

PMID: 31449256
DOI: 10.3791/59798

ABSTRACT:
Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) is a routine diagnostic procedure essential to both medical and veterinary practices. It consists of the percutaneous aspiration of cells and/or microorganisms from palpable masses, organs or effusions (fluid accumulation in a body cavity) using a thin needle similar to the regular needle used for the venous puncture. The material collected by FNA is in general highly cellular, and the retrieved aspirate is then smeared, air dried, wet-fixed, stained and observed under a microscope. In the clinical context, FNA is an important diagnostic tool that serves as a guide to the appropriate therapeutic management. Because it is simple, fast, minimally invasive and requires limited investment in the laboratory and human resources, it is extensively used by veterinary practitioners, mostly in domestic, but also in farm animals. In studies using animal models, FNA has the advantage that it can be performed repeatedly in the same animal, enabling longitudinal studies through the collection of cells from tumors and organs/tissues over the course of the disease. In addition to routine microscopy, retrieved material can also be used for immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, biochemical analysis, flow cytometry, molecular biology or in vitro assays. FNA has been used to identify the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei in the gonads of infected mice, opening the possibility for a future diagnosis in cattle.

ABSTRACT:
Congenital ocular coloboma is a genetic disorder that is typically observed as a cleft in the inferior aspect of the eye resulting from incomplete choroid fissure closure. Recently, the identification of individuals with coloboma in the superior aspect of the iris, retina, and lens led to the discovery of a novel structure, referred to as the superior fissure or superior ocular sulcus (SOS), that is transiently present on the dorsal aspect of the optic cup during vertebrate eye development. Although this structure is conserved across mice, chick, fish, and newt, our current understanding of the SOS is limited. In order to elucidate factors that contribute to its formation and closure, it is imperative to be able to observe it and identify abnormalities, such as delay in the closure of the SOS. Here, we set out to create a standardized series of protocols that can be used to efficiently visualize the SOS by combining widely available microscopy techniques with common molecular biology techniques such as immunofluorescent staining and mRNA overexpression. While this set of protocols focuses on the ability to observe SOS closure delay, it is adaptable to the experimenter's needs and can be easily modified. Overall, we hope to create an approachable method through which our understanding of the SOS can be advanced to expand the current knowledge of vertebrate eye development.

DOI: 10.3791/58902

ABSTRACT:
Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used in a wide variety of fields, due to the opportunity it provides for precisely visualizing and quantifying flows across a large spatiotemporal range. However, its implementation typically requires the use of expensive and specialized instrumentation, which limits its broader utility. Moreover, within the field of bioengineering, in vitro flow visualization studies are also often further limited by the high cost of commercially sourced tissue phantoms that recapitulate desired anatomical structures, particularly for those that span the mesoscale regime (i.e., submillimeter to millimeter length scales). Herein, we present a simplified experimental protocol developed to address these limitations, the key elements of which include 1) a relatively low-cost method for fabricating mesoscale tissue phantoms using 3-D printing and silicone casting, and 2) an open-source image analysis and processing framework that reduces the demand upon the instrumentation for measuring mesoscale flows (i.e., velocities up to tens of millimeters/second). Collectively, this lowers the barrier to entry for nonexperts, by leveraging resources already at the disposal of many bioengineering researchers. We demonstratethe applicability of this protocol within the context of neurovascular flow characterization; however, it is expected to be relevant to a broader range of mesoscale applications in bioengineering and beyond.

TITLE: The application of rapid prototyping to improve bone reconstruction in immediate dentoalveolar restoration: a case report.
AUTHORS: Martins da Rosa José Carlos, Fadanelli Marcos Alexandre, Zimmerman Diego, de Oliveira Rosa Ariádene Cristina Pértile
JOURNAL: The international journal of esthetic dentistry (2017)
PMID: 28653055

ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: This article describes the use of rapid prototyping (RP) for diagnosis, planning, and execution of the reconstruction of hard and soft tissue in socket defects using immediate dentoalveolar restoration (IDR). SUMMARY: In cases of tissue loss in anterior dental areas, esthetic rehabilitation poses a major challenge with respect to treatment planning with the goal of long-term tissue maintenance. The IDR technique consists of immediate reconstruction in a single procedure of bone and soft tissue around implants placed immediately after extraction, and prosthetic rehabilitation. As this procedure is immediate and flapless, the correct diagnosis of tissue loss and correct graft adaptation are mandatory. RP can increase the precision of the procedure, as demonstrated using a clinical case characterized by total loss of the buccal bone wall and gingival recession. The results were evaluated by clinical assessment, photography, radiography, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), and prototyping. CONCLUSION: The application of RP facilitated the execution of IDR as it enabled more accurate diagnosis of the socket defect and more precise adaptation of the tissue graft. A clinical study should be conducted to evaluate the effects of RP on the clinical results of the IDR technique.

AUTHORS: Wawro Marta Ewelina, Wieczorek Katarzyna, Sobierajska Katarzyna
JOURNAL: Postepy biochemii (2017)
PMID: 28409575

ABSTRACT:
Microtubules are involved in any vital cellular activities, including the maintenance of cell shape, division, migration and intracellular transport. Microtubule dynamics is regulated by the balance between their polymerization and depolymerization. Microtubule stability is dependent on their alpha and beta subunits composition, tubulin post-translational modifications and interaction of microtubules with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Disruption of these processes can lead to a number of pathological conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, or the fibrosis development. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the modern methods of microtubule polymerization analysis. This allows a better understanding of the structure and mechanisms played by microtubules in their physiological functions and the development of pathological conditions resulting from their disorder. Mikrotubule pełnią kluczową rolę w podziale, utrzymaniu kształtu, ruchu komórki oraz transporcie wewnątrzkomórkowym. Regulacja ich funkcji możliwa jest dzięki zróżnicowaniu dynamiki polimeryzacji i depolimeryzacji mikrotubul. Stabilność włókien mikrotubularnych zależna jest od składu budujących ją podjednostek tubulin klasy alfa i beta, ich modyfikacji potranslacyjnych oraz oddziaływania mikrotubul z białkami stabilizującymi ich strukturę. Zakłócenie tych procesów może prowadzić do powstania szeregu stanów patologicznych jak rozwój nowotworów, chorób układu krążenia czy zmian o charakterze zwłóknieniowym. Poniższy artykuł podsumowuje obecny stan wiedzy na temat nowoczesnych metod analizy polimeryzacji mikrotubul pozwalających na jeszcze lepsze poznanie struktury i mechanizmów pełnionych przez mikrotubule ich funkcji fizjologicznych, jak i rozwój stanów chorobowych wynikających z ich zaburzenia.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECT: The aim of our study is to determine if the respiratory position (free breathing, end expiration) influences bolus arrival time (BAT) or the quality of the SI-time curve in the test bolus measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 150 consecutive patients in free breathing and end expiration with 1 mL contrast media (CM) and a flow of 3 mL/s with MRI. The BAT in the aorta and the quality of the SI-time curve were determined. RESULTS: In 13/300 measurements BAT could not be determined because of poor quality of the SI-time curve (two free breathing, 11 end expiration). Mean BAT was 21 s in both respiratory positions. In 13/137 (9%) there was a difference in BAT in end expiration and free breathing of more than 5 s without a tendency towards elongation or shortening of BAT due to the respiratory command (RC). Quality of the SI-time curve was significantly better in the second of both measurements independently of the respiratory position and in free breathing compared to end expiration. CONCLUSION: Test bolus examinations may differ in an individual patient of more than 5 s without a tendency towards elongation or shortening due to the RC. SI-time curve quality is negatively influenced by the RC.

METHODS:
We examined 150 consecutive patients in free breathing and end expiration with 1 mL contrast media (CM) and a flow of 3 mL/s with MRI. The BAT in the aorta and the quality of the SI-time curve were determined.

ABSTRACT:
The implementation of 64-slice scanners allows for isotropic imaging with shortened acquisition time. Beam-hardening and spiral artifacts can be reduced by using sophisticated tube technology with so called double-z-sampling. The following article is meant to provide a brief overview concerning substantial changes as they could be witnessed in clinical routine using a 64-slice scanner, with special focus on CT-angiography in general and CT-angiography of the coronaries.

ABSTRACT:
Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women: almost 10 % will suffer from breast cancer during their life and almost half of these will die of it. The spectrum of radiologic methods for diagnosing breast cancer is wide, including X-ray mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance mammography, and minimally invasive biopsies. After long-lasting controversies, breast cancer screening using X-ray mammography has now been introduced in Germany, following the projects in the Netherlands and Sweden. However, assessing mammographic films under screening conditions requires skills distinctly different from those needed under clinical conditions. This first part of two covers the histopathological basics and X-ray mammography; the second will deal with ultrasound of the breast and magnetic resonance mammography.

TITLE: Anaphylactic shock induced by gadoterate meglumine (DOTAREM).

ABSTRACT:
The use of contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging improves the effectiveness of this diagnostic examination. Complexes of godolinium, which appear to be well tolerated, are used for this purpose. A few cases of anaphylactic shock have been attributed to these agents. We report a case of anaphylactic shock due to gadoterate meglumine (DOTAREM). While undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging examination, a 33-year-old nonatopic female patient became severely hypotensive, lost consciousness, and had generalized erythema immediately after the intravenous injection of this product. She recovered rapidly after she was given injection of epinephrine and her blood volume was restored with intravenous fluids. That DOTAREM had caused this immediate hypersensitivity reaction was proven by the positivity of prick-test and intradermal test at 10-3 (0.37 mg/ml) and in vitro leukocyte histamine release test. The results of these tests indicated that it was the gadoteric acid rather than the meglumine component of DOTAREM that was responsible: positivity of IDR at 10 mg/ml. Skin tests and leukocyte histamine release test to gadopentetate dimeglumine (MAGNEVIST) were negative. In addition of the exceptional character, this observation provides evidence for an immediate hypersensitivity without cross reactivity with gadopentetate dimeglumine.

ABSTRACT:
The aim of this study was to obtain first clinical experiences with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with digital subtraction (MR-DSA) using an automatic floating table for visualization peripheral arteriosclerotic occlusive disease (paod). We examined 10 patients on a 1.5 T MR unit applying a fast MRA technique (3D FLASH) with intravenous application of positive contrast agent. MR-DSA examinations were compared with the gold standard intraarterial (i.a.) DSA. MR-DSA proved to be useful for routine application which could be performed sufficiently in all patients. MR-DSA and i.a. DSA showed comparable results for imaging of the pelvic and upper leg arteries. Looking at the thighs image quality of MR-DSA did not match the image quality of i.a. DSA in every case. This was due to venous overlap and in comparison to i.a. DSA reduced signal-to-noise ratios. However, clinical findings, obtained with MR-DSA, were sufficient for adequate therapy planning. Our preliminary results reveal the potential of this new technique to become a realistic, robust, and non-invasive alternative to i.a. DSA in the diagnosis of paod.

ABSTRACT:
Comparison of image quality in X-ray mammography between conventional film screen film system (SFS), digital phosphor storage plate in and without magnification technique (CR) and digital CCD-technique (CCD). Radiograms of an RMI-mammography phantom were acquired using a conventional screen film system, three digital storage plate systems and two digital systems in CCD-technique. Additionally, the radiograms of one digital phosphor storage plate system were post-processed regarding contrast and included in the comparison. The detectability of details was best with the digital mammography in CCD-technique. After confirming these promising results in clinical studies, digital mammography should be able to replace conventional screen film technique.

ABSTRACT:
UNLABELLED: Due to the high frequency of asymptomatic pyelocaliceal dilatations, most of them with prenatal diagnosis, the diagnosis of obstruction remains a major chance. Isotopic diuretic renogram (IDR) remains the basic diagnostic tool, although it has some pitfalls and undetermined diagnosis. To obviate them, several others tests have been used, such as diuretic Doppler ultrasound (DDU). The object of this paper is to determine its validity. METHODS: All the patients with hydronephrosis and with grade II dilatation or bigger were studied wit DDU. The results were compared with those obtained by IDR, obtaining 2 x 2 tables to analyze specificity and sensibility. RESULTS: 37 patients were studied, 9 of them bilateral, with a total of 46 dilated kidneys. There were 22 males and 15 females. 59 percent had prenatal diagnosis and 57 percent were asymptomatic. 22 percent had grade IV dilatation, 37 percent grade III and 41 percent grade II. 2 cases had contralateral vesicoureteral reflux. IDR showed 15 obstructed kidneys, 7 of them with a regular renal function. 16 were operated, one more due to abdominal pain despite a non-obstructed IDR. Only 7 of the 15 kidneys presented an obstructive pattern in the DDU. Comparing both tests, DDU had a 46 percent of sensibility and 100 percent of specificity and a negative predictive value of 79% for a 95% interval. Kramer index was 0.54 representing a very low association. CONCLUSIONS: In our institution, DDU is not better than IDR to diagnose obstruction. We consider its use as a second line test in cases of doubtful IDR.

METHODS:
All the patients with hydronephrosis and with grade II dilatation or bigger were studied wit DDU. The results were compared with those obtained by IDR, obtaining 2 x 2 tables to analyze specificity and sensibility.

PMID: 8975495

ABSTRACT:
CD-R will be introduced internationally as a standardized individual archive and exchange medium allowing individual solutions for long-term archiving in a catheterization laboratory. The concept of digital archiving on two CD-R includes a long-term primary basic archive and a secondary one edited by intelligent (medical) data reduction (IDR). The basic archive is automatically composed by a background process consisting of unprocessed images or image series and is fundamental for further transfers, storage, presentations and additional studies. The digital working archive comprises a set of images and image series edited by IDR, as well as the results of morphometric studies as well as identification and documentation data. IDR is based upon the elimination of useless and redundant images series, documentation of coronary interventions on one single representative image and on the reduction of relevant images series and physiological data into an ECG-controlled representative cardiac cycle. IDR edits a redundancy-free set of 130 images (diagnostic study) or only 85 images of an interventional study. Two cardiologists and two cardiosurgeons independently studied 24 IDR-edited angiograms and the corresponding unedited digital angiograms and found no significant differences in the diagnostically relevant coronary morphology and left ventricular function. This study shows that an edited angiogram may not only serve for digital archiving but also form the basis for further evaluation or copies.

JOURNAL: Journal de radiologie (1994)
PMID: 8051670

ABSTRACT:
Primary tuberculotic involvement of the salivary glands makes up two per cent of all cases of salivary gland tumefaction that we have had to explore with ultrasonography and sialography. The patients are generally young adults of a low socioeconomic status. Sialography is nonspecific, whereas ultrasonography can suggest the diagnosis in the presence of heterogeneous, hypoechogenic intraglandular lesions associated to adenopathies. An IDR with tuberculin is essential for the diagnosis before treatment.

ABSTRACT:
A 73-year-old patient suffering from evolutive nodular goiter, free of other local complaints or changes in the general status is presented. A diagnosis of tuberculous thyroiditis with hypothyroidism is reached. This diagnosis is justified by the antecedents of the patient, positive IDR, low iodine uptake, characteristic scintigraphic and echographic picture of the thyroid. Following a treatment with tuberculostatics, potassium iodide and controlled life regimen for a year, thyroiditis was cured as proved by scintigraphic and echographic evidence, and normal iodine uptake and PBI.
